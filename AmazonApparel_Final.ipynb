              "'i love these thicker training pants.  they look like regular underwear, but are extra absorbent.  my son has been day time potty trained for months, but he still wears these training pants.  he paricularly likes the ones with the cars on them.  they are hard to find in the stores, too, so i am glad i found them on amazon. love this outfit on my little man. fits well and is very soft finding work pants that fit my husband is always a challenge. these are exactly what he needs for his job and there were ample size selections. they fit exactly as expected. i was expecting some thicker sweatpants but they are alright. they are straight pants so if you like those type of pants, this one is good. it is originally a marvel brand so that\\'s great! i bought this for my best friend since she loves loki and i think she is going to be happy overall. very lightweight & comfortable! good price and quality. i was worried about them being see through because the only yoga pants i have are the normal flaired legs and i see a lot of people wearing skinny legged ones and they are see through in the sunlight but luckily these arent! i love them! they fit great, and are very comfortable! the pants are great, but everyone considering buying them should consider the following rules of conduct when wearing or handling the american flag pants. the pants should never be dipped to any person or thing, unless it is the ensign responding to a salute from a ship of a foreign nation.<br />the pants should never be drawn back or bunched up in any way.<br />the pantspants should never be used as a covering for a ceiling.<br />the pants should never be used for any advertising purpose.<br />the pants should never be fastened, displayed, used, or stored in such a manner as to permit it to be easily torn, soiled, or damaged in any way.<br />the pants should not be used as part of a costume or athletic uniform, except that a pants patch may be used on the uniform of military personnel, firefighters, police officers, and members of patriotic organizations.<br />the pants should never have any mark, insignia, letter, word, number, figure, or drawing of any kind placed on it or attached to it.<br />the pants should never be used as a receptacle for receiving, holding, carrying, or delivering anything.<br />the pants should never be stepped on.<br />in a parade, the pants should not be draped over the hood, top, sides, or back of a vehicle, railroad train, or boat. when the pants is displayed on a motorcar, the staff shall be fixed firmly to the chassis or clamped to the right fender.<br />when the pants is lowered, no part of it should touch the ground or any other object; it should be received by waiting hands and arms. to store the pants it should be folded neatly and ceremoniously.<br />the pants should be cleaned and mended when necessary.<br />if the pants is being used at a public or private estate, it should not be hung (unless at half staff or when an all-weather pants is displayed) during rain or violent weather.<br />when a pants is so tattered that it no longer fits to serve as a symbol of the united states, it should be destroyed in a dignified manner, preferably by burning. the american legion, boy scouts of america, girl scouts of the usa, national sojourners, and other organizations regularly conduct dignified pants-burning ceremonies, often on pants day, june 14.<br />the pants should never touch anything beneath it. contrary to an urban legend, the pants code does not state that a pants that touches the ground should be burned. instead, it is considered disrespectful to the pants and the pants in question should be moved in such a manner so it is not touching the ground.<br />the pants should always be permitted to fall freely. an understandable exception was made during the apollo moon landings when the pants hung from an extensible horizontal bar, allowing full display even in the absence of an atmosphere. the fit is great, they are long on me but i\\'m 5ft. the fabric is really stretchy and comfortable. shipping was also really quick even with standard shipping. happy i bought more than one pair. not much more to say.  if you like purple (and can deal with disney characters) then these are for you.  great to lounge and sleep in in cold weather. i bought these for my friend who is 5\\'9&#34;, with a body type similar to the girl in the picture. these pants fit her perfectly. i could not believe how good they looked on her. 100 stars!!!!! kiss rocks these are some of the best lounge/yoga pants i\\'ve yet to find. i plan on buying more in other colors<br />they have the perfect fit and the fabric is good quality bought as a present and my wife loves them! the only complaint i have is that the cuffs get a bit loose so they tend to sag over my son\\'s feet. otherwise, they\\'re great baby pants. super stretchy awesome! love these! however they are smaller then most leggings but look very cute, i love the animal print i just wish they had sizeing options and didn\\'t have the fake &#34;jean pockets&#34; printed on them i really like this set and can\\'t wait to figure out what to wear with it. pants were fine -- nice fabric and well-made.  however, i should have ordered my regular size instead of the size that i thought i needed because of the pull-on aspect.  i look rather hippy in the pants. it was a gift for my daughter. she called me and said \\'mom, did you buy this for you and send to me in error\\'. not her style.  i have similar outfits like this. nice pants.  no complaints. these are quite comfortable and sexy.<br /><br />i caught the eyes of many with these!!!<br /><br />these leggings are nice!<br /><br />i encourage anyone to purchase these! reasonable price, came a day before expected and fit very nicely. i recommend getting them a size larger if your a tall person. these pants are awesome. very comfortable and very stylish. i wore them into my daughter\\'s first grade class and so many of the kids were asking me &#34;what kind of pants are they?. it was hysterical. but a lot of complements and it\\'s refreshing to wear something that no one has ever seen before. nice fit. a little see through though this product fits well and you can tell it will not deteriorate after a few cycles in the machine.  they are decent enough to wear anywhere, and they are excellent for exercising/walking in the park. if you want workout pants that have quality workmanship, try a pair or two. these pants are great- only thing, no pockets. but they are still a good choice. excellent item at a bargain price- fast shipping, too! comfy and fit well. good product i bought these thinking they might be a bit small but no they definitely are true to size so mine are a bit larger but i absolutely love them they are so comfortable and breathable i love lounging around in them best summer pants out there i have received so many compliments from them! shrunk a bit when washed but very cute. i actually have a little problem with the size of one of them but dont worry its great quality and the seller contact me inmediatly and returned my money. but like i said they are great. like another reviewer wrote, they run a bit small. i\\'m a 6-8 in pants and large fits me just right. so very comfortable. not so flattering on backside but so worth it. pockets are generous and hold my large cellphone securely when running errands. would buy again. my baby is due in the summer time, but when i first started needing maternity clothes, it was still pretty cold outside. i hated to buy a bunch of winter clothes though, that i\\'d only really need a month or two. i loved the fact that these pants were dual purpose, i could wear them as long pants while it\\'s still cold & roll them up once spring/summer comes along. the material is nice and lightweight, very comfy, and i\\'m a big fan of anything with the secret fit belly. i did have to exchange them for a smaller size, but be careful because mm carries two very similar styles in-store, the only difference is the drawstrings at the bottom of the legs. the ones with the drawstrings don\\'t run big, the ones without the drawstring do! strange but true! probably best to buy in store where you can try them on. edit, the wash report:  the deep jade pants shrank a full size, and about 6\\\\\\\\\" in length, when dried on high cotton heat.  the bluebell pants did not shrink.<br /><br />the other reviewer noted that \\'bluebell\\' is not like the picture.  she\\'s right;  it\\'s much lighter.  the color is somewhere between medium sky blue and columbian blue;  looks nicer in sunlight.  search on \\'cornflower blue\\' with \\'plus size pants\\', and when you see the same \\'sport pants\\' name, that color is the real one.<br /><br />so too, the \\'deep jade\\' isn\\'t jade at all, but more like true green, in sunlight.  even so, if you\\'ll purchase matching top and bottom, you need to match the color names, however inaccurately they describe the color.<br /><br />pants are nice;  picture shows accurate draping, but the waist on pants like this (and on the 7-day) is extremely high, nearly at the bra line, unless you have an extensive belly.  i have already purchased several of these in other colors, and they wash, travel, wear, well.  you can tumble dry on high cotton and they do shrink;  but do not pill or fade.  the shrinkage:  i ordered tall.  the original inseam was 32\\\\\\\\\" per the product description, but after washing on warm but drying high hot, the inseam is now 26\\\\\\\\\", and the pants shrank a full size, as well.<br /><br />so these pants differ from the 7-day, in that they will shrink if dried on high cotton setting.<br /><br />this style has drawstrings, but you can remove them.<br /><br />fabric is substantial, not flimsy, not see-through.  great to wear under a blazer, can be dressed up or dressed down -- if you have the right colors.  i use pants like these as an alternative to formal dress pants in business.  but the \\'bluebell\\' or \\'deep jade\\' colors are not worthy of that usage.  still not sorry i bought them, but will not buy these two colors, again.<br /><br />pants are sized generously, so if you want true fit, order a size down.  if you like baggy, order in your normal size or one higher.  they are very comfortable and long-wearing pants, either way.  the ones i\\'ve had i bought in the 1990\\'s, and they are still like new;  so i expect these new ones, to last for some years.<br /><br />you\\'ll want to wear these often.  when or if they become unfit for public wear, they are fabulous for around the house.comfortable and long-wearing pants, either way.  the ones i\\'ve had i bought in the 1990\\'s, and they are still like new;  so i expect these new ones, to last for some years.<br /><br />you\\'ll want to wear these often.  when or if they become unfit for public wear, they are fabulous for around the house. awesome pants!! great yoga pants. perfect shape and length. love these! my husband and i love this!  it\\'s really cute and made of quality materials!  i love the tux design, i feel like it\\'s cool and not hokey like some other tux designs i\\'ve seen.  can\\'t wait to dress up our little man! very good i wish i would have ordered a large, the ones i received in basic training have been worn out... i have grown since my teenage years and a medium is not as loose fitting as it was back then... i will be ordering more of these pants but a size bigger... these are fantastic. i have chunky legs & calves. these fit well even over my calves.  they are long enough too. plus they are slimming. i like the fit, does good for my behind, but wish they were a little bit longer.  i am a size 4/6 and ordered a medium. these kept my legs warm at night while in zero degree weather while only wearing basketball shorts under. i wish they stayed up better and wern\\'t as long, but they were comfy they fit me perfectly (little big, but i got a bigger size to be safe)! they are super comfortable and adorable. plus the company sent me a care package full of coupons! the older i become a lot of thing\\'s in life changes, the only thing what never changes is a good quality product to wear.<br /><br />i wear this item for 10 years ago about and it only becomes better and more comfortable.<br /><br />i suggest you to purchase this item over any other scrub pants because it\\'s comfortable and fits perfect on whoever wears them. cute sets!  something different from what i find in stores! love love love them! perfect fit and super cool and comfortable! i want more colors now to complete my summer wardrobe! they are not as large as i thought them to be but they are ok. they are not machine washable so that was a let down and took a while to get shipped. i assume because the are not shipped from the us. my step-son loves pink on his newborn daughter, hence why my wife and i bought these for our new grandbaby.  he tells us they are cute and fit very well. they\\'re great especially for the price and what they are. an excellent product!! the fit of these pants is a big more snug especially around the butt and thighs- which i not only did not mind, but actually liked. they are also super long though. the length wasn\\'t such a problem for me coz i need to alter the length on most non petite size pants i buy anyway and these pants just meant i cut off more fabric before i hem. but for those who fit well into normal size pants, these might seem unusually long. but the best thing about these pants is the heavy weight fabric. if u are looking for something warm and compression-like, these are the pants for you! if u like a relaxed fit and lighter fabric, i recommend the  alki\\'i pants[[asin:b007n71jj4 alki\\'i women\\'s cotton lycra fold over yoga pant]] got these as a gift for my wife, she loves them. it\\'s about time that medical scrubs look as nice as regular street clothes.being a nurse i am used to working in a sterile environment but atleast my daily workwear is bright and cheerful.  i have gotten lots of compliments from the novely tops i have ordered. the quality of the items have been excellent and i especially like the jenny\\'s private brand.  the fit has also been good. i have washed my purchases atleast several times each and they came out very well, no fading or shrinkage,  would recommend this seller, price is right and shipping was fast. these pants are actually great! i love them! i wore them for my birthday. my friends were in shock and were asking where i purchased them lol :) my teens love these.  i guess they run a bit small--the small fits my 5\\' 105 lb and my 5\\' 2 100 lb daughters very well.  of course they\\'re meant to be loose and the waist is stretchy so there\\'s probably a range of sizes they\\'d fit but on a taller girl the small would be cropped.  they were comfortable right away but did get a lot softer with washing. these arrived yesterday and fit perfectly. they are stretchy, not too see through (although i would wear something to cover your but, they are slightly see through around the &#34;really stretched areas&#34; if you know what i mean) and are comfortable. not to mention the pattern arrived just as shown in the pic (which isn\\'t always the case) i would definitely purchase again. had a hard time figuring out what type of shirt to wear with these...but super comfortable! for small accidents. don\\'t expect it to hold large amounts of urine... i took the advice of the other reviewers and went up a size.  the leggings fit perfectly!  i am 5\\'4\\\\\\\\\" and the leggings were definitely long enough so i didn\\'t look like i was wearing high waters.  they fit well and looked great!  they are a great find for the price! thin,soft. i would prefer a wide instead of an elastic waistband. i love the embroidery on these.  based on the other review, i ordered up a size, and unfortunately they were huge.  i next ordered my normal size in other miss me knit pants, and am even considering going one size smaller for a more fitted look, as the front is still bunching a little, due to extra fabric.  it\\'s doing sort of like how it\\'s bunching in the picture even when i am standing straight, so i can definitely say these are not cut small.  i may keep my normal size, even though it\\'s big, and just drawstring them for a loose fit though.  my concern is that being 100% cotton knit they may stretch out and be huge by the end of the day.<br /><br />also, in the picture it\\'s not obvious, but they are cut straight, which i really like in my knits.  the length is a bit excessive for comfy pants at 33&#34;, but other than that i love these. i love these! i ordered more. i use them for under my skirt they\\'re very comfty!!! and they fit great and for me its hard to find some that fit properly since i have wide hips. i like the product. cute but the seam at the crocrotch tore after a week of use i love these things they are so comfortable!! they fit great and came right away. however watch the shrinking. as it does happen. thanks! these are a teensy bit short, but that\\'s fine. they fit well and as expected -- not too large or small. a good item this item was purchased for christmas and all the people at home were thrilled to see the quality of the product, they charm. love it too long. nice i gave this product a 4/5 rating because they are so cute and actually fit my long legs, but if not for those good things, the rating would have been a lot lower.  why?  well, when i opened them up, it was like the stench of chemicals punched me in the face, and clung to my hands and was so overpowering.  i laid them in our attic for a few days to air out, and the chemical smells where not as strong, so i could try them on at least, and they look great (i\\'m 5\\'9, 135 lbs.).  i have super long legs, and a long torso, and they fit to my ankles and went up to my belly button.  the picture makes them look like super low rise pants, but they really aren\\'t.  i tried folding the top down a bit, kind of like a yoga pant, and they\\'re perfect that way.  they still have a chemical smell after a few days of airing out, so i\\'m keeping them in the attic to air out some more before i wear them out anywhere.  the tag on the ones i got said size 2, and they\\'re made of 95% polyester, and 5% spandex, so i\\'m not expecting them to shrink when i wash them, which i will do before wearing them to get out any remaining chemicals.  but, if you\\'re tall, and don\\'t mind waiting for the chemical smells to air out, they\\'re not a bad buy.  they\\'re stretchy, cute, and seem comfotable. i had three days to find something to wear, i owned zero black dressy pants. i have amazon prime so i knew i would get these pants the day before or the day of the event. if they didn\\'t work out, i would have to wear black jeans. anyway, after studying these and two other pairs for hours... i decided to go with these. i am so glad i did. apparently they slim you, because i had my grandma say to me that i lost weight and i look good... which both of those things i know didn\\'t happen.  anyway, these fit great. i am 5\\'8&#34;...got a big butt and hips, i wear a size 22-24, depends on how they are made. i am 200something pounds. these perfectly! i am so glad i went with these. get them, you won\\'t regret it. they fit as expected... so get your usual size. i have not washed them yet, as i only wore them one day. the length is perfect, i\\'d say 33 inseam or very close to it. no gap waist and they do not show anything unwanted. they cover great. bazinga! these pants were purchased as a christmas gift, and the recipient loves them! bazinga, bazinga, bazinga, bazinga, bazinga, bazinga! john deere is a favorite company for our family. we all go back a long way so this was a must for our newest family member. it is a really cute outfit that is comfortable and nice looking when he wears it. the color is brilliant and looks really good on our boy. we are very pleased with this john deere green outfit. very good choice for us. we enjoy seeing out boy wearing this outfit. i love these pants.  they are warm and they stay on well.  my daughter kicks like a maniac and they don\\'t ever slip.  they actually fit her the entire 3 months the were supposed to fit as well.  they stay soft after washing.  can\\'t say anything bad except maybe they are a tad pricey. i love harem pants so i may be a bit biased but as far as looks, these pants look great. they fit the way leggings would except baggier around the crotch. they\\'re comfortable of course and as far as size goes, they fit fine too (i ordered a small)-i wear a small usually, but depending on the garment i can fit an xs and wasn\\'t sure how it would fit since it\\'s in asian sizing apparently. only reason i gave these 4 stars instead of 5 because the material is really thin. actually, these really are more like leggings than pants, that\\'s how thin they are. my other harem pants are more of a sweat pants/yoga pants fabric and that\\'s what i was expecting perfect fit.  exactly as i expected. good value for the money using it as part of a halloween costume i potty trained my 2 year old with this. at the beginning she used this over her panties so accidents would not become huge messes on the carpet. now she uses them over the panties just to sleep. they hold full accidents well enough, just be careful and put the kid in a bathtub or shower before taking this down. after all they are just a barrier so the pee is puddled inside.<br />the bummis are durable and light. my baby feels comfortable in them and she is not in a hurry to take them off. still look like new after several months of use! bought it to go with the full costume version because i wanted the pants over the skirt. they go great together. these are a great pair of inexpensive bootcut trousers.  they are a perfect fit and i\\'ll probably buy a couple of additional pairs for work. great!!! so comfortable and sooo warm.  our weather has been very, very cold here, these are just<br />wonderful in this winter weather!thank you!!! i got these for my brother who is in a wheelchair.  they have nothing to leave a sore on his bottom and were priced more reasonable than the wheelchair clothing.  i would recommend these to anyone wanting a comfortable pair of pants to lay around in on the weekends. they\\'re a little snug, but overall fit well. i wore them to the electric daisy carnvel (edc) worked well. they do not breath, but will keep you pretty warm as a result. i imagine because mine were warn at a show, and i was jumping around that the silver kinda rubbed off and made black spots. they were good for a one time use. very comfortable i\\'ve been wearing these workout baggyz for a few years. where i got them from, didn\\'t supply them anymore. i was upset about it. i thought that i couldn\\'t get them anymore, until i started searching on google. and i found them through amazom.com. thank goodness for that. i really like them for workout, pj pants, or just plain lounging around in. that\\'s why i got five pair. they are hard to come by. thank you amazon.com well made these pants are substantial and non-pilling, a great combination. they are comfortable but they don\\'t stretch out. i\\'m ordering a few more pairs! i love these jeans. a previous poster said they are thin and she is right that they are thinner than most denim. however, they are quite nice for hotter weather when you want a pair of jeans. they fit well and are lighter weight but not too thin, and are well made. some people have commented on other websites that they shrink in the dryer, so i don\\'t do that. i hang them to dry or put them on the air dry cycle in the dryer for a few minutes and they come out fine. cute i wear these my home and as pajamas. they are so comfortable! these fit perfectly.  i love the feel and i\\'ve decided to wear them to go out instead of running. great fit! cozy! correct color! i will buy another pair in a different color for sure!<br />i probably will get x-large though, so they will be a little looser for my &#34;fat days&#34;. i planned to wait for at least two washings before buying a second pair, but i only made it through one before i had to order another. my comfy pants situation is rather desperate, so i\\'ll just hope these hold up as well as they have so far. (looking and feeling perfect after the first wash and dry.) the ones i have now are cobalt, and i just ordered brown. i\\'m going to get a second (maybe even a third) pair of cobalt eventually though, as i love the vibrant color, and it livens up my wardrobe now that i seem to have a lot of black tops!<br /><br />5\\'4\\\\\\\\\"/ 115 lbs--small fits perfectly. it doesn\\'t touch the floor unless i have the top just grazing my hip bones, which is how i tend to wear pants. lots of flexibility with the wide, stretchy, fold-over waist.<br /><br />excellent for working out in, and i felt elegant adding heels and a nice top. my husband says it looks like a skirt, but i can move about in it as if it were any pair of pants.<br /><br />oh! flattering too! great for emphasizing the behind while de-emphasizing the thighs . . . these pants confirm to your body type and hug in all the right places. i wish they made these in more colors...well worth the price. so soft and comfy! alittle shorter than i usally get but i would still get them because they are so comfertable. my 81 year old mother loves it and it fits great.  the fabric is very soft. just what i was looking for, i\\'ll be back for me. the best yoga pants i\\'ve ever fitted in. a bit small.  definitely low rise.  darker color than pictured. i dance west coast swing 3 or 4 nights a week & these pants give me everything i need. most notably, no &#34;muffin top.&#34; they are extremely comfortable & are true to size. i pretty much always wear a size 10 or med & their med fits me perfectly - including length. i am only 5\\' 5 1/2&#34; so these probably aren\\'t going to work for a tall person. i was worried about the fit because disney products often run small. these were a perfect fit, a bit thin but comfy, with great colors. they worked great in s.e.asia tall grass and work just as good in az. scrub brush. the fabric is gorgeous. it is buttery soft and drapes well, but heavy enough not to cling, completely opaque. i purchased medium for my size 12 daughter. she said they were too loose and pajama-like. i\\'m a curvy size 14, they fit me perfectly. i also got them in a large for me, they fit more like knit pants, less like fitted exercise yogas or leggings. if you want a fitred exercise pant, size down. if you are looking for a casual, polished looking pant that feels like the softest pajama ever, order regular size. they are cool and comfortable, and wash well. i will be back for more! treat yourself, you won\\'t be sorry.... i am a petite 5\\'1&#34; and usually wear size petite 2-4, so i usually expect to find that most pants are a little big or long.  these pants fit just the way i like - just about 2 inches longer in the length but i tend to like them w/ a little extra length just in case i wear sandals w/ a little heel on them.  they have a nice style to them, and they are soft, flowy, and very comfortable.  i am thinking i may have to buy another pair! i cannot believe i finally found like minded individuals to share my love of zubaz!!! i love them so much i wrote a story to them. [...] excelent pants fit great! my butt looks amazing in these jeans! my daughter is average size for a 2 year old, roughly 26 pounds, and this fits a little large, but just enough for growth room. she is obsessed with tinkerbell, so this was a good choice. the price is on point and the quality is good. just be sure to wash before wear. material is soft and warm, print is adorable, my 1 month old weight a little over 7 lbs and the shirt fit a little small he won\\'t be able to wear it for much longer omg, i\\'m back to buy them in every color. so comfortable. i wear. 14/16 in pants, pear shaped, and am loving how the xl fits.  i am 5\\'7&#34;, but long-waisted, short-legged. the length is long on me. i have a 30&#34; inseam. i\\'d guess they would fit a 32&#34; inseam perfectly. for winter, i will only wear them as lounge pants or pajama pants, since they are thin, but in the summer, they will be cute with a tank, worn outside. could wear these pants everyday!!!  the southern heat can get really miserable even in shorts but these are so lightweight and comfy.  a step above even the other harem pants i own because these ones have pockets!!!!!! soft and comfortable, great fit. i chose a 3 even tho im a 0-2 and was very pleased! came very quickly also! these aren\\'t my style, but i am a hero in my son\\'s eyes. he loves them. great fit...worth the price so i don\\'t have to shop around to find them!!!!!!!!!! so i bought these to lounge/ workout since all my victoria secret ones seem to eventually rip. these are still in good shape and wear them all the time.. i love cheeta print! these leggings look exactly like the photo. they fit very nice - nothing to complain about (not too thin, too short, too long or to high on the waist.<br />i\\'m 5ft 5inches, 150lbs everything good! i just received these leggings today. speedy delivery, amazon told me i\\'d receive them tomorrow! i got a small , i was really nervous with buying online and not being able to try them on. they do have a tight fit like all leggings, it just required me a little time to get them up, they fit well though. i don\\'t know what a medium would feel like, but a small fits just right. i plan to wear them for st. patrick\\'s day. the high-waisted part made my belly a little sweaty for the time that i had them on, but its something to get used to. these are a great buy and so worth the price.<br /><br />***update 4-13-13***<br /><br />i wore these leggings on st patrick\\'s day. i think one of my thighs are bigger than the other. that was the only thing that boyherrd me. but with dancing and walking they were great. they were actually kept my legs a little warm also. very much worth it! :d these pants are awesome! they fit perfect, make your butt look awesome and are really soft. for the price, you can\\'t beat it! bought 3 pair already i plan to buy more! i\\'m a curvy 6 and medium was perfect. ok! i bought it for my wife. it is beautiful and fit ok ! to large for my size i\\'m 5\\'4 and 117 pounds and this fit great, super comfy and stretchy. i bought the pants to finish out my star wars rebel trooper outfit. these are the most comfortable pants i own and the twirling affect is amazing. love them! beginning to come apart at a seam though and this concerns me. worth the money, just be careful with them. love it.  am 5\\'1, 118 lbs.  i intend to use it for work with heels, and it\\'s perfect with heels.  will be keeping it. these teez are my favorite pants and are<br />true to size.<br />i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; and the length is perfect! so happy! bought these to work in my shop which is not heated. linning is very comfortable.<br />now i actually wear these instead of blue jeans on casual fridays.<br /><br />the negatives : i am told these are totally out of fashion. my younger co-workers kidded me for being so &#34;80\\'s&#34; and suggested i get a pair of zippered shoes to go with the pants. i am so glad the fashion police granted me immunity back in the \\'60s!<br /><br />my wife complains that the swishing sound these pants make when walking  is annoying. i find the sound less annoying then her complaining. runs small. they are surprisingly nice looking- great for cosplay pants are great! nice and long. love the cell phone pocket! these pants are super cute and sooo soft. i ordered a sz larger and they fit perfectly. i just wish they were a bit longer but they will do fine love these...have used them for field training many times and they hold up great. these are the perfect fit.  just smack right on as to size.  i washed the first pair in the washing machine--great.. i made the mistake of putting them in the dryer and they shrank in length (though not width!) about an inch.  so with my second pair i will machine wash, but will air dry only.  am ordering 2 more pair! bought as a gift so no info on fit; was super soft and adorable cute i\\'m 5\\'3 and 125 pounds, and these pants fit perfectly! they look absolutely amazing when spinning! i\\'m a hula-hoop dancer and the flair from these pants really add to hoop dancing. i can\\'t wait to get more money so i can buy the black and green pairs as well! the order came quickly and well packaged, with a nice bellylady tote bag to boot.i highly suggest these pants to anyone looking to add some flair to dance practice, or just every day outfits (i wore the red pair to college a few days ago and i received many a complement that day).<br />happy hooping/dancing/living everyone! i bought these for my wife in white, fully expecting them to be somewhat sheer. they did not disappoint! very sexy! i bought these for my girlfriend and she says they are very comfortable but they are see through! i told her i would return them and she said no... she said &#34;these are too comfortable to exchange and i will only wear them around the house.&#34; great shirt and was a great gift!  thanks love them and can\\'t get enough this is such a cute tracksuit! i lounge all day in it but it\\'s fancy enough to go to the store in. very comfy and clingy in the right places. only negative i would say is that it does run a bit small if you have large bust and rear. the back pockets bulge a little if you have a behind bit it\\'s still cute. just a little short, otherwise they are super comfortable and cute. i truly enjoy the comfort of yoga pants. my only complaint is that i wish i could find them with a longer inseam. i bought 3 pairs of these pants - two chocolate brown and a khaki color.  i am jealous of the reviewer who found them in three colors.  i am thinking of buying another pair of the khaki because they are so comfortable and flattering.  i hope they make these in other colors for fall or winter. great pants that i wear on memorial day and 4th of july.  truly embody the essence of the american flag.  i would say that the material felt a little thin for my tastes... i love love love these. they\\'re comfortable and fit me just right! they look great on and i can just flow into these for my morning workout. a long top (i have a generous booty) and a change from sneakers to shoes and they can go out with me too! i will be ordering more. these pants are really comfortable and a good weight - not too heavy  but not too sheer either. they are a bit long, even for a tall girl like me (i am 5&#34; 7 1/2&#34;). they also attract dog hair and lint! overall, they are worth the price paid. the sweatpants were good. they look like the picture. they did run a little small. they feel great. i should have bought more. i am a 37 chest, 38 waist. and 44 hips. i got the large and was worried it wouldn\\'t be the right size. it fits perfectly and leaves room for my belly to grow more. these bottoms are great they fit good and are super cute!!!!!!! i bought these pants a few months with the expectation that they would be a low quality due to the price. boy howdy was i ever wrong!! these were a very good quality and the fit was one of the best that i have ever had. they are not only comfortable they wear like iron and are truly wash and wear. they dry wrinkle free and are ready for their next wearing. who could expect any thing more? i will be ordering more of these for many years to come. thanks amazon and windham for making such a great product available and at such a reasonable price. this adorable outfit is currently being worn by my granddaughter.  it looks great on her.  the jacket comes in handy in the cool weather we are having. all pieces seem well made and fit well. loves it! fit great!!!!!! the waist on the pants are about two sizes to big. the length is perfect. the little sweater is perfect. my daughter just loves it. i will order more! i have a curvy body and have trouble finding bottoms for belly dance and sambas. these are such a great buy and stretch enough to slide over my bottom half.  and people keep complementing the little skirts that hides the  hips and upper thighs. my son has decided that he doesn\\'t like jeans because they\\'re \\\\\\\\\"too confining.\\\\\\\\\"  these pants fit him great and i love the drawstring waistband. he couldn\\'t find anything to complain about with these pants which is really saying something. excellent fit, great product!!! they fit perfectly but do run on the long side ( my daughter is 5\\'6&#34;).  i wias actually looking for the leggings but these fit into boots just fine so are perfect for taking the place of leggings and as yoga pants. you guys rock you guys sell the best yoga pants i the world i will definatley be back simply the best the pants are great. everything i expected \\\\\\\\\"lovely\\\\\\\\\". the perfect underware  for begin the fall the color the size all is perfect, im really happy with my new tshirt for the ski love these pants! i am so grateful that i listened to the other reviewers on size. i am 5\\'7, 143lbs athletic, but with hips for sure, these have a perfect capri length harem pant fit. i would buy ten more pairs if it wasn\\'t so redundant :). highly recommend, by a real mom, with a real body and a real life. i got the package a little late do to the poor weather here in new york (snowstorms) however the pants were stiff at first but after a few hours wearing them they softened up. i haven\\'t immediately washed them but they have gotten wet but i haven\\'t noticed the dye problem people have pointed out. other then that the product i received is very lovely. i recommend it to others who are interested in purchasing it. :) because these pants were so inexpensive, i thought the quality was not going to be very good. boy was i wrong- they are perfect! they have an adjustable waistband and a great cut. they are just as good as the pants i paid $98 for at a maternity boutique. i only wish they came in more colors! great color love them no sizing tag, so can be worn backwards or forwards.  very feminine. no pockets. looks great while walking and it flows around.  some thought it might be a dress as the legs are so wide.  i\\'m 5\\'2\\\\\\\\\", and with short heels it looks great!  it was 100 degrees here today, and they weren\\'t hot at all.  my mom likes them so much i\\'ll order a pair for her.<br />will update after i wash them and let you know how that turns out. love these.<br />love the look, the fit and the feel.<br />will buy another pair...soon. these pants are awesome, very comfortable and fashionable. this is made really well and isn\\'t a super thick thermal so my baby won\\'t get too hot, but will still be warm. looks to be sized perfectly. my baby is only 3 months old and i bought this for the winter and it looks like it will fit her in 3 months. the print is really beautiful and i can\\'t wait for her to wear this. i went on a couple of cold weather runs with this (25 - 40 degrees f).  it breathes well and kept me warm from the cold wind. i like the foot straps that keep the pants from running up and it fits well. i would buy this again as the price was right for a quality product.  i washed this a few times and had no problem with it. i am 5\\'1&#34; 125lbs. pants were tight but once i got them on and buttoned up, they do their job!  my butt looks amazing, says my husband;) i gave it a five because i have 1 of those already and just wanted an exchange. they didn\\'t give me a hard time about it and answered quickly. fits perfect!! second pair of these pants so comfy! i just have to say how thrilled i am to have found a good place that has the baggy tripp pants!!! i\\'ve had such a hard time finding them ever since the tight skinny emo style took over everything. i can\\'t stand today\\'s fashion with all the prep and emo influences. give me a regular ol\\' t-shirt and a comfortable pair of baggy tripps!!!<br />i was very happy with how simple this whole experience was, not an ounce of drama. i ordered my pants and they arrive well within the allotted time. i open the package and other than being a tad bit wrinkled from it\\'s journey, they were in pristine condition. i immediately tried them on and they fit perfectly.<br />best of all, they look awesome with my wheelchair.<br />i love my new pants!!!! very high quality base layer. warm, dry and flexible. it is a base layer and wont keep you warm by itself but with just a light shell it does wonders down to very cold temps. they are a little longer but that\\'s ok. very cute! these pants not only have beautiful and original embroidery; they are simple, and comfortable. the cotton is extra soft, but thick enough for durability.  they flatter hips and thighs, are snug but not too snug around the waist, and are a great average length to allow for free movement in yoga or dance.  when i wear them, i know they will not only look good and wear well, but that they are unique because of their embroidery.  (not to mention the awesome price for original yoga pants!!) a very good product with surprisingly good fit.  would recommend this website for anyone with waist size or length issues. just like napoleon dynamite &#34;you think any body is going to mess with you in these pants??&#34; hell no they won\\'t my son is not quite here yet but i am excited to put him in these adorable pants!  they are the softest item in his closet, definately would buy more if they were available in more colors.  will certainly think of these for baby gifts in the future. these are very cute, good color. haven\\'t washed them yet, will hand wash tough,. these are the very tight, stretchy, shiny type of leggings, just so you know. they looked at first as though they would be too thin and maybe see through but once they were on the body they looked stunning. they are low-rise and fit snug to the skin. very happy with purchase, great price. thank you. but for being a 3t. they look awful small. my daughter in law said my two year old granddaughter is in a 2t. so being pj\\'s. i wanted them to fit nice and comfortable. not just fit for one season. to be honest, i\\'m not really sure. i\\'ll have to leave an update after she gets them at her birthday party and i hold them up to her for an idea if they are going to fit ok. just what you need to start the potty training. better then pull-ups. wash up wonderfully!! i especially love the waist, as most waists on pants are too small for my abnormally large waist.  the pants are comfortable and they give.  they also do not wrinkle easily. my grandson enjoyed it although it was a little big for him, he is 11 years old<br />would recommend it my son was a hit at my sisters wedding. everyone thought he was the cutest. my sister hinted she wanted him to wear a tuxedo. found one that was easy the whole time. im sure he was comfortable in this because he slept the entire time. i tried these on and my boyfriend loved them...these definately shows off my curves...even makes my stomach look smaller too. excellent awesome dance wear. i love them! they are a bit thinner than i expected, but no more than any other dance pants. these pants are very nice!  i love the color.  i ordered them for my son who is in a wheelchair.  due to his disability, i have to dress him.  these pants go on easily.  i will order more and a shirt to go with it next time. i bought these for dance. i needed a pair of comfy loose fitting pants to move around in and these worked great. i was very surprised at how fast these shipped, they fit amazingly, very comfortable material and look awesome. the waistband has no give as stated so best to order your exact waist size or even one size bigger. i will definitely be ordering from here again because of the fast shipping and amazing prices. these pants seem to be holding up well.  were purchased as a gift for a child.  think that they will last for some time.  the material seems to be durable. these pants are awesome!!! they are very flattering and comfortable. perfect flare. perfect fit. no yoga pant camel toe...and makes the butt look good. but thin- my dogs nail ripped right through 2 pairs. damn dog. ok, so let\\'s start from the beginning:<br /><br />price: great.<br /><br />size: great, but like everyone else said: too long. i fold mine over and have begun to sew them (just being lazy and haven\\'t finished lol). i am 5\\'5\\'\\' and 150 lbs... the medium fits like a dream.<br /><br />quality: i wear mine many days in a row to work (yes, i know, gross, but i need to buy more), and they rub between my legs and the material has gotten odd there. but the material has not worn away and it really has stayed true to color, size, and material through many wears and washes.<br /><br />i love them. i will buy more. i have to order petite sweatpants because i\\'ve never found them in a store.  the length is perfect........i\\'m 5\\'3&#34;.  i weigh 140 and these are a tiny bit loose, but that\\'s what i wanted.  nice and warm. ordered a second pair. i bought these for my daughter who is a size 24-25 jeans- they fit perfectly!  they are cozy and warm and she loves them.  i would buy again! these fit exactly like i was hoping. i\\'m a size 8 and the mediums fit nice and snug but are stretchy enough to be comfy and hug all the right places. they are soft on the inside so they were easy to pull on. they look great with a variety of tops, making any outfit sexy, especially with a pair of boots. the seams look nice and tight but i\\'m not sure how long they\\'ll last after being washed a few times because of the vinyl material. hopefully washing a lot won\\'t be necessary. we love kicky pants! so soft and snuggily. gave it four stars though bc the button on the back of this nightgown can be kinda frustrating, but we usually just leave it buttoned. and also, the fabric gets less soft after a few washings... but i just wash it with baby\\'s other clothes. with the next one we have maybe ill try not to dry it! but even so, we still love this brand! buy them. great leggings, true to size chart, not see through, they last a few wears before they\\'re stretched then wash them and they\\'re back to 100<br />%. great for spring and summer, if they were thicker they\\'d be perfect for all year round. i am 5\\'2&#34; and the length is prefect even after washing.  wash well, i take them from the washer, smooth them out a bit and hang them to air dry and they look great without ironing.  i bought them for around the house and yard, great for an old hippie like me. these leggings just are colourful as pictured, came way earlier than estimated. the tag says 95% polyester 5% spandex (differs from the product description, but not by much). i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; 115lb -- they successfully reach all the way to my ankles, and are slightly more sheer at the butt region due to stretching, but it is inperceivable if i wear skin- or dark-coloured panties. however, my legs are pretty slim and i usually wear size xs-s (product description says it fits s-m), so i imagine someone with bigger legs than me might stretch the legging to much more sheer. this is probably because they ship from china, where people are smaller. be aware. i\\'m really happy with these though! love it!!! these are perfect for work. i love that the band comes up under my bra. these fit nicely although they will not be very warm come winter. they are also very long i\\'m 5\\'5. so these will work perfect with a heel. very comfortable just too long but i always have that problem because i\\'m 5\\'1&#34; so i just alter them myself with a little hem tape. i could live in these all day, everyday. i\\'ll have to order them in different colors. i bought these to wear under dresses & skirts. they fit snug. they are extremely comfortable and extremely stretchy. i paid less than $10 for these & i am absolutely happy with my purchase!! i am 5\\'4, 105 lbs, and wear size 1 & 3 and these are a must have for any skinny girls wardrobe. bought two one white and one black,,i should have gotten the next size down ..but all in all it is a very comfortable fit to watch tv or even sleep in...a very good buy..sexy too bought this for my teenager for her halloween and she love it! they\\'re a little see-through but otherwise adorable and extremely comfortable. super comfy,fit perfect as the size that i orderd and colorful pants as the same photo on amazon. nice for potty training. pretty darn cute! the &#34;see through&#34; bits aren\\'t as sheer as i had imagined from the pictures. but still look adorable on and trust me, i don\\'t have pencil legs like the girl in the photo either, and they still fit and look pretty great. i didn\\'t think that these would be so cute and awesome because of the low price, but i was pleasantly surprised. they look like the picture, and are super comfortable as well. i love it! fits perfect holds up really well elastic at the waist is good, love the print and fabric, but ankle is a bit wide, doesn\\'t hug the ankle.... keeping them anyway very loose fitting, very warm, good quality i recently decided to purchase some new pj\\'s online, i didn\\'t really know what to think because i hardly ever buy clothes but i have to say that i\\'m really satisfied with what i got. the only bad thing is that there are so many choices i had such a terrible time choosing which one i wanted, quite a good problem to have if you ask me. i\\'m actually thinking of getting another pair because they\\'re so nice, i\\'d recommend these to anyone who was looking for some comfy pj bottoms~ great pants, but too short for me. i bought a size l and i am 5\\'9. these work well as bedtime underwear for my child. looks like picture, printed material -- but rater thick and warm. love these leggings for the price! these pants fit nicely and are very comfortable.  i\\'ve only washed them once, but they seem to be well made  and i\\'m hoping they hold up for quite a while.  good price for yoga pants that can be used for any kind of work out. since i\\'m tall (5\\'9) i always worry when ordering leggings that they\\'ll be too short. but these are perfect these go all the way down to my ankles and then some. but i\\'m also on the small side (125lbs) and these are already pretty thin so anyone that\\'s a little bigger i wouldn\\'t reccomend buying these because they\\'ll be extrememly see through. other than that it\\'s exactly what you expect, very cute & i like them a lot. they come up to about the middle of my tummy but i don\\'t like that so i fold them down. and the cuts go all the way down to your ankles (but it\\'s harder to see those since the bottom gets bunched up) & can come up pretty high but for school or something you can pull them down to about fingertip length. 4/5 because of the thinness if you have skinny legs these are perfect. they\\'re not really a true \\'skinny\\' fit. the picture doesn\\'t do them much justice, i\\'ve gotten lots of compliments on these, and they\\'re nice and durable just the way i like my gear. impressed with volcom for such great quality when i ordered these they were way too short not long at all! but vivian fashions emailed me and sent out new long pants and they are great!!!! sooooo happy with them and awesome customer service!!! very cute!!! impressed!! the fabric is nice, soft and stretchy. it has lovely drape and just a bit of elegant sheen. i bought them as workout pants, and cut off the bottoms accordingly (i\\'m a short lady), but i could also see buying a pair and leaving them long to dress up with a pair of heels for an elegant but super comfortable eveningwear outfit.<br /><br />the cut is perfect. i\\'m a short lady, so i had to cut off a few inches at the bottom in order to actually do yoga in them, but that is usual for sizing. i like that the top is cut a little high, so i get better belly coverage on inverted poses. i usually find higher waisted pants uncomfortable, but on these it\\'s comfortable and an excellent feature. i especially love that they come in multiple colors instead of just black!<br /><br />i\\'ll probably buy another pair of these soon. nice buy and a great price the material in these pants is thinner than i expected, but the fit is great, especially for chubby legs.  to me, they look more like pajamas than pants.  for some reason, i expected them to be of a sweatshirt material, but they are just thin cotton. just the right fabric weight, fits perfectly with one exception!  these pants were a tad long so i gave them to my grown daughter who is taller than i am and voila, things worked out beautifully. my girl friend loves them when i am wearing them it fun to have sex in them they are nice an comfy this pants are so comfi and have the right length. don\\'t wanna wear anything else. really hip excellent product i used this costume for a dress up event at the hollywood bowl. it isn\\'t high quality, but for the price it did that job...and i got lots of compliments! the pants were a bit hot--was hoping for cooler weather, but all worked well and looked good. lovely!!! great quality! i was looking for pants in this style that are not chinese made, and found them.  haven\\'t put them through intense use yet, but so far i\\'m very satisfied.        one point that may be of help : the \\\\\\\\\"long\\\\\\\\\" inseam is really quite long - it appears to be around 36 inch inseam. if you are really tall in the legs, you are in luck- if not, then likely the regular leg length would be good.      waist sizing seems \\\\\\\\\"standard\\\\\\\\\". good quality. just a bit tight in the waist on my cloth diapering 4 months old. when he\\'s 6 months, it may be too tight. nice jazz pant they wash up nice.  they run long. i was very surprised how well they fit! i have bought these pants for a few years now. i am a big momma and just love these pants for work. i have to wear the khaki\\'s everyday as part of my uniform and haven\\'t found anything that compares to these. 5stars in my book. awesome warm tights!!  i love them an woud buy many more if i could! a bit larger than expected but good quality. the print is cute and bright! i bought these for my 2.5 year old when we first started potty training and they worked like a charm.  they are a little absorbent but nothing huge.  perfect for little accidents.  my daughter weighs 26lbs and the 18months fit perfectly.  and still do. great all-purpose capris.  i\\'ve always been happy with the secret fit belly. i stand 5\\'7\\\\\\\\\" with 30\\\\\\\\\" inseam so i ordered the large size.  these pants were a bit long for me, but other than that, they fit very well.  i plan to purchase again after i have saved up the money. fit great. the pocket was the perfect size for the item i am carrying. very comfortable and discreet. very comfy but run very big. so if you  wear a large to be baggy, you may fit into a small. favorite belt in the whole world but as the previous person who wrote a review, the belt is a bitch to get through dickies belt loops. about 5 minutes to put on and 5 to take off... but it wouldnt be the same if it was changed... love love love it... ok great pair of mid-weight lounge pants. i wouldn\\'t go so far as to say go out shopping in them as some people might but for at home comfort, you can\\'t beat em! i got these pajamas for my daughter who is 16 months who is small for her age (maybe 40% in height, like 24-25 lbs maybe), she wears 12 and 18mo clothes now.  these already were a little tight.  so buy a size up if your child is tall for her age.  it\\'s frozen and she loves them of course.  lighter weight long sleeve.  good for the price the suit was pretty but the style didn\\'t look good on me. i am so amazed at the quality of the hoodie!  it\\'s so much more than i expected!!  i can\\'t wait to show it off!!  the xl fits 2x perfectly! amazing material, charm me its texture and design. i was afraid to buy it, but i recommend it, it was highly satisfactory. these are amazing. i don\\'t even work out that much, but when i put these on, i just want to run a marathon while singing america the beautiful. great for working out or just lounging around. they were very thin and did not lastbut seller stands behind product. pants fit great except for the elastic at the waist. its pretty snug and makes the softer parts of my hips stick out, not very flattering :p otherwise they are awesome pants. :) these look lovely with a pair of heels on! a great pant for the professional woman the fabric is soft and comfortable the waist band trims the waist and takes off inches. i bought the black and brown . love it think i found a new brand....... comfy, i love them!  :) perfect fit for my son and he\\'s a large man. shipment was on time and the price was good. after a diverticulitis (colon infection) attack a few years ago, tight pants and i don\\'t get along. i wanted something other than standard sweat pants to wear to work in my woodworking shop. these fit great, feel comfortable, and look better than sweat pants. there are plenty of pockets also. i will buy more for certain. i looked for quite a while for camo sweat pants. they are hard to find. awesome awesome for anysize girl with flare! seriously one of the nicest pants i own.slit on leg gets me amazing complements and the dangling fabric pieces are just too awesome to describe. get them! i bought this with another item from this same company.  i was very pleased about this purchase.  i tried them on and they fit great.  i love the pockets on each side.    ease of movement and i\\'ll be wearing them on the plane for my long trip next month.  in fact they would make great exercise pants too -- better than sweats.   i haven\\'t washed them yet, so that\\'s the reason i only gave a 4 star.  i\\'ll see if they shrink when i wash them.  if they don\\'t shrink,  then i will give them a 5 star. works just like my hot pants brand but much cheaper. does have a strange smell, but i used them to cut the grass first time wearing and was sweating so much it eliminated smell. i wash mine in a sink with woolite and hang dry i bought some stinger yellow pants in the past of the same size, but these savage orange ones are substantially bigger.  i probably should have gone one size smaller, but the tabs on the sides make it easy enough to just cinch them up. overall well made, just a tad big. good price i love how they fit . this was a great buy and mine kind of fit high waisted but tht means i could wear them either way they are very comfortable, but the reason why they don\\'t get the 5 starts is because they leak. so, if your baby is almost potty trained, this are great! these pants are amazing, i\\'m about 5\\'3 and a little thicker than most, but i wear these pants everywhere, very stylish. this was what was ordered and meet expectations would recommend again. and why do i have to keep writing a review when only a few words is neccessary i bought this set size 18 months. my daughter wears it since 16 months, when he was to her a little bit big, and continues to be now (she is now 20 months). so this is completely match the required size. in this set, i especially liked the 3/4 sleeves - for a child at that age it is very convenient not to stain them while eating or playing in games. in addition, decorating is that needed for the girls - a combination of bright colors, flowers with buttons in the middle, ruches. and she wears it with pleasure. these pants are really great quality. i have bought them before and i\\'m very pleased on how they stay looking great wash after wash. i love this style of yogas. they\\'re long, so they cover up part of your feet, they hug your body without losing the shape of the pants and they have the fold over waist band. also they feel like expensive yogas, not the really thin ones pants are made very nicely. there just isn\\'t a lot of stretch in the material. super cute. fit true to size. i am 5\\'3 about 105 lbs and the xsmall fit great. may not last too long, but thats why they were only $10. would deff reccommend. so soft and comfy. great quality and fit but a bit long. these are awesome. my husband doesn\\'t like them but most men don\\'t like this look. they are comfortable and soft and i love them. if you have really long legs they may be a little short on you but still one of my favorite outfits now. i am very familiar with alfred dunner pants and can count on my 14 petite short to always fit perfectly.- and they did.  also the quality is always very good. the pants are exactly as they were represented.  love them fit awesome and easy to move in. i would order more! i bought these pants for zumba as they were much more affordable than the zumba brand.  they are comfortable, lightweight and fit well. it arrived a little larger than i wanted, but they are well made and i washed them once in cold water and they have not faded yet. i will wash them in warm next time and see how they stand up. i washed them last time inside out. they are well made and i have only wore them once. i need to give them a good pounding and see what happens. i love these!!!! they are amazing and fit very well i just wish my son wouldn\\'t puke on them lol but i love these &#60;3 i wear them with my demonia books all the time ^_^ adorable! fast shipping and the pants are great..iv ordered jackets and long sleeve shirts plus iv bought from the store so they have good clothes but they run small so get a size up from what u usually wear and dont dry or they will shrink bad!!! the pants r great. high quality material very thick.  i get tons of compliments on them.  shipping was swift as well. i did notice a missed stitch here and there with the thread hanging but who cares they were 20 something dollars and i\\'ve already worn them half a dozen times. perspective if u will ;) i\\'m in fanboy heaven i\\'m 5\\'8\\\\\\\\\" and 135lbs and these things fit like a glove. the only issue is that they come like an inch above my ankles which is a bit short for my taste. they have the perfect amount of shine and they are very slimming. love these! they\\'re super comfortable and look great touch me colored denim pants with leather and zippers  for review<br /><br />nice stylish jeans perfect for any jean occasion but with a little up scaled look (you got to have the edge right). they are nice jeans but sizing is a tad bit toward the small side. my daughter loves these!!! nice added padding perfect for potty training! perfect for my 2 yrs old he loves it as well and holds from little accident son loved them! these are durable nice looking and button fly so he can\\'t break a zipper. comfortable good quality fits great excellent sit like a glove. nice fabric. arrived quick, perfect fit i absolutely love these pants!  i was actually hesitant to spend $35 on maternity pants (yes i\\'m frugal ha!) but with 2 months of work left and very few biz casual clothes i can wear i needed some things.  i\\'m glad i went with the good reviews - these are amazing!  the fit like a glove, love the feel of the fabric, and actually make my butt look great, for a size 10-12 i look pregnant cute!  buy them buy them buy them!  oh i bought black, i\\'m sure the grey are great too but it\\'s not really in my color palette. i would reccommend my daughter started potty training very early, and we could not find any type of training pants that would fit her.  the gerber ones we way too huge, and i absolutely hate pull ups (she thinks they\\'re diapers, so what\\'s the motivation to use the toilet).  the waist on these was small enough for her to wear before she was 2, but the actual panty is large enough that she can still fit them at 3 1/2 (she now wears them to bed at night), so they have a good range of time that you can use them (2t).  they are fairly absorbent, but work best for small accidents on the way to the toilet.  for larger accidents, you may need to pair them with plastic pants.  just a random suggestion, but i made additional training pants by simply sewing cloth diaper material into the bottom of her regular panties.  they worked even better than the store bought variety.  over all, these were a really good deal, and met my expectations! these pants are confy, airy, and cute to boot.  perfect for playa attire. no more hassle with trying to keep socks on the baby! the fit is good for babies that are on the long/lean side. will definitely be buying the next size up when he grows out of these. i liked them but after i washed them they was to short  the quality of them not good the pants were as described and the quality excellent!  couldn\\'t believe the price was so reasonable, too!  it is hard to fine black pants for baby boys! i live in these damn things. they\\'re basically sweat pants make of cotton fabric rather than fleece. i\\'ve owned sever pair of these over the years by the same manufacturer. two thumbs up. super comfy..i didn\\'t think i would like them, but to my amazement, they are exactly what i wanted...don\\'t hesitate to buy them. love em! nice  and warm. not waiting for a flood either. lol. these are really cute. snug... no stretch to them at all. i like the little bit of shiny-ness to them. i gained about five pounds over winter. will wait until i lose my winter coat to wear them again because they are very unforgiving that way. these pants are my absolute favorite!! came on time, fit perfectly, and look amazing. i want to wear them all the time! got these for my friend for her birthday, she absolutely loves them, and gets lots of compliments from people when wearing them. i really like these pants.  they are well made and in addition to the swim/peace detailing on the front - there is also a small peace sign on the back right pocket.  these are exactly like typical scrubs with a drawstring and elastic waist.  small buttons down the front and cuffed pant legs.  they are not too thin (which is good considering they will be worn after swimming) the colors are as shown - light blue pants with blue/green/white detail.  they run long and the sizing is accurate considering these are athletic pants.  fast shipping -  i received them 2 days after ordering.  great product! these are the most comfortable pants i can imagine with beautiful colors (i ordered 3 different colors). the pockets are the right size, pretty and functional. the pants fit me perfectly - i am 5\\'6&#34; and 130 lbs. they were packed in the cutest little bag that i am keeping to use for other &#34;stuff&#34;.<br />when i first took the pants out of the little bag, i was shocked to see how small the pants looked. i thought, &#34;no way i can fit in these&#34;, but trying them on, they fit beautifully. so don\\'t be taken aback when you first see them.<br />i live in southern florida where it\\'s hot and humid most of the time. this rayon material is perfect for this kind of weather. also, i don\\'t like to hand wash. so i washed them in the machine on permanent press, then hung them up to dry and they look like new: no ironing whatsoever! good stile this is my first pair of yoga pants so i didn\\'t know what to expect.  these are super comfortable.  didn\\'t shrink when i washed them.<br />the large fits great and i usually wear size 12 or 14 pants depending upon the fabric and cut.  i am 5\\'7&#34; and they touch the bottom of my workout shoes in the back and drape over the front of my shoes.  very satisfied with them. very comfortable yoga pants. a little bit long for a short person but very comfortable none the less. will probably buy a few more pairs. very comfortable and looks very nice. the  yoga pants are very nice i just need<br />a one size bigger. these are awesome, i want more! the only issue i had was a super itchy tag. they\\'re perfect otherwise. i\\'ll probably end up getting more. good service great product. i love this pant, specially for this price, only one complaint: a little too baggy, still would love to recommend everyone; a good buy, overall happy. i am tall....and these fit great....and wear beautifully.  no shrinkage that i can tell....and they are very soft and comfy. these pants are so long , i\\'m 5\\'4 and they drag on the ground. fit nicely everywhere else but at least 4 inches too long they run a little big,  but are what you would expect.  i bought 3 pairs,  so they seem fine..  i would order them again.. good awesome pants.  they fit much better than i expected, a little long, but i have a short inseam for my 5\\'7&#34; height.  great fabric and fit for the amazing price. i feel like the fold over holds my tummy in firm!  bonus!! i normally wear a small, but some people had posted that they ran small and to get the next size up,,so i did, and they were right,,,,,the medium does fit like a small.........so they run small, but they are great pants! soft and stretchy,,,,and a little silky so that nothing sticks to them) nice and warm for the first 5k of the year. fits great! the fabric and feel is perfect. enough give for movement and comfort. the cut fits well, too. wish there were more color choices. its tough on the areas where it needs to be rough like the knee area and butt area, comes with huge side pockets on both legs and you can tighten up the bottom part of the pants with strings and comes with adjustable wasit line thing that adds like an extra inch or two around the wasit line if you a heavey set guy. all in all good pants i am usually a large in sweatpants so that\\'s what i got, but these run a little big. i found it okay though i liked the baggy feel to them. i love the jumpsuit, it fits nicely, a little in the thin side but still super cute can someone post pics of they joggers so i can see what they look like in person thanks. great! love the fit when i first got it there were some issues with the instructions and putting it together and thinking more pressure would get it into place it broke. the manufacturer was super duper on the customer service end of things, made everything right, no questions asked. i noticed some people complained the plastic broke. they are reviewing the wrong item. this is 100% wood and metal. i may not  use it often but i am glad i have it on the ready. although the design was not what i expected, it is an amazing fit and i have washed it multiple times and it still has yet to fade! i totally disagree with another comment i read--these pants are very comfortable and were great for my first few months coupled with the button front shirt/jacket. this line is not expensive, it\\'s life with you is short, so go nuts! i love the basic styles, good cut and material is great for running around when you\\'re a working mom who also happens to be pregnant! i definitely recommend! i got a pair of this pants around 3 weeks ago in one of my local department stores. this pants look so good that i just decided to get another pair in another color. pros<br />very comfortable<br />quieter than most cargo pants<br />good color<br /><br />cons<br />runs small - i\\'m 5\\'3 and 125lbs, i bought a medium based on some of the other reviews. the waistband is still snug, but they do fit.<br />the elastic that holds them up won\\'t keep the pants from falling over the elastic, so don\\'t expect them to stay up. great item very fast shipping.fabric very.soft and comfortable i did like the way the  pants looks  but give it still a  4 stars because it was a little small... i\\'m very picky about comfortable pants. i like the french terry material and the little stretch it gives.  i am a plus-sized woman and like a little support, but not tight.  these have enough stretch in the material that make them very comfortable and flattering.  i also like danskin now french terry pants.  i would order more if they came in other colors. i have added these to my favorites. super soft and comfy. a bit warm but overall really great pants. i bought these pants many moons ago. very, very comfortable. but the fabric on these pants are prone to more wear & holes than the other ufo pants i got. the fabric is different. i had to give them up because i gained weight, as well as a couple other pair of my rave pants. i recently bought the khaki thermal lined ones & i bought another pair of these tye dye ones, but the green & blue tye dye. i am planning to buy another pair of these red/yellow tye dye ones, \\'cause i loved them so much, but gotta have the money first. i also want to get another pair of ufo shorts & the ufo cords, hopefully later this summer. i don\\'t go to raves, but i am one of those people more into comfort & my own style, wearing what i like & makes me happy, instead of wearing what everyone else wears. hey, no shame in my game!! it\\'s not like i am going 3/4\\'s naked like alotta indecent folks do these days.... it is fantastic not bad for a cheap pair of sweats! i doubt i\\'ll ever wear them to the gym, but i wanted something lighter to lounge around the house in in the warmer weather. and these are exactly right for that! good quality. perfect fit super comfy my son is really long and was struggling to stretch his legs in the footie outfits. i received one of these as a gift and it is perfect. they are incredibly soft and i put a pair of socks on him to keep his toes warm. i bought one is every size and color! these are my favorite pants. they are more cotton than nylon. they are so cute on. i wear a size 5 and got them in a large. it fits perfect! nothing to say so comfortble. i ordered a second pair. love these pants. granddaughter loved it! i just received these pants with matching top and i\\'m about to order more colors. i absolutely love them! light, pretty and so comfortable! perfect for warm spring and summertime. plus...very fast delivery. thank you! the pants are very cute and comfy.  they are little long for someone 5\\' 3&#34;, but the waist fits fine. very cute! amazing comfort.  fabric is pilling and looking sad from thigh rub after only a few wears.  fabric faded too.  for the price and insane comfort, i may buy more anyway.  the giant print is actually flattering.  i was not sure when i ordered these if i would like them, but i have to say, they are probably my favorite pair of pants!  like jammies, without looking like i am in jammies.  a pretty top and sandals, and out the door looking put together!  these were awesome during a recent trip with several hours on the train.<br /><br />im 5\\'7, 195 lbs and i normally wear a size 14 or 16.  the xl is plenty big, almost too big. bought these for work, and they are really nice. much better pair of pants than the ones i usually get at local retail stores. super comfy and super breathable.  have one in every color!  the only thing is that they run a little bit big so order a size down i\\'d say the waist band isnt as snug, because i am a large, and there is a more leg space. but i like the feel of both l and xl excellent it meets my expectations, fast shipping, great product quality, good value for the price, nice color, texture/material, and it best fits me comfortably... alfred dunner pants are perfect every time.  i own many diferent colors, and never have been disappointed with the quality or attractiveness of these pants.  i urge them to maintain quality and beauty.  ik am a totally satisfied customer. these pants were a perfect fit. fabric is nicely soft. wish there were more color choices. would definitely recommend this apparel. great pant. wish they were made of heavier material. have not washed yet. that will be the test of how great they really are. the fabric is really comfortable. it fits well and does not look cheap at all. i ordered these for my girlfriend who is 5\\'2\\\\\\\\\" and a size zero. they fit great over her legs and hips but were a bit loose in the stomach area (she has a tight stomach). they look amazing on her, however the first product i received had a horizontal run across one side of the butt. i contacted the seller and they asked to see a picture (or maybe i offered - i don\\'t recall) and when they saw the run, they said they would send me a new pair...which they did immediately. from first problem contact to resolution (shipped replacement with tracking number) was within the same day. great communication from them. i would buy from this company again without hesitation.<br /><br />update 6/11/13 - the replacement leggings arrived some time ago and they look great - no flaws, fit great strong seams (seams are the most likely place where these type of garments tear or fall apart). we went to the hardware store the other day and some guy walked into a rack full of parts ogling her. i had to laugh. i\\'m ordering more colors! i don\\'t really wear clothes for the compliments, but these pants come with them anyway which is great because they are so very comfortable. i\\'ve worn them multiple times (it\\'s hard not to wear them every day)! they are great with my chucks or sandals. i wear them on my long days at the salon. very comfortable.  washes well. i purchased these for a 14 hour car ride to mi. washed and tried them on tonight and love them! i like that the material is snug and doesn\\'t appear that it will stretch out. i am 5\\'7&#34;, with an athletic, swimmer frame and they are super comfy. i will definately be bying more soon. nice athletic pants. i bought the medium sz 10-12.  the waste fits my very thin son (10 yrs old) great but these do run very long. they will probably be perfect for him in a year if they hold up that long. had a pair of these from years ago and had been looking all over for another pair.  insanely comfortable. so comfortable! quality products promptly delivered. i had bought others through this company . the first one was perfect. then i got 2 others that were a different material. 2 years later tried again and this one is it! everything about it is perfect. fit , texture, style..all a 10! this item fit exactly like i thought.  i ordered the 3x/2x and i normally wear 14-16 jeans.  they are a bit on the thin side, however one doesn\\'t need to worry about coverage due to the skirt.  i get compliments each time i wear them.  super comfortable!  i will purchase more my 5 month old is currently wearing them. he is 14lbs. they are long, so i roll them up but they fit his waist well without being too tight. they are the cutest thing. and handy. i am a babywearer and i can wear him in these without them hiking up to his knees. they will be soooo useful when he is crawling. we bought the 2t size expecting it to be a little bit big so he could grow into it over the summer. my son just outgrew his 18 month clothes, so we are in this awkward spot where 24mo/2t stuff is a bit big and the old 18 month too tight/small. all of the rest of his 24mo/2t shirts fit slightly smaller than the top in this outfit does. the shorts are on par with all his other 24mo/2t clothes. so, i would say the shorts are true to size but the top is a slight bit bigger than most 24/mo/2t (long in torso and arms...width seems fine). the torso being long isn\\'t really a problem but the sleeves are about 2 1/2 to 3 inches too long so they absolutely have to be rolled up and i am not sure how long they will stay like that once the suit is wet and he is playing. i will update on if they stay rolled...im not hopeful. otherwise, the suit is very cute and i love the zip up design. they fit great i had no issues with sizing, ordered a 2x in black of these shorts and it says it ranges from 43-47, i wear a size 46 and these fit just right, 1/4inch or less of extra waist room. they are nice and lightweight and i really like the material. keeps me cool in a hot kitchen environment, but can also throw some long socks on and tough it through the cold and windy days.<br /><br />i will definately purchase more of these<br /><br />update<br />i wanted to come back and update the review of these shorts.<br />the zipper broke after about 3 months of owning these, but i still loved these shorts so i kept them to be repaired<br />had the zipper replaced and im still toughing it out with them<br />i bought them in black and the color was very deep and dark when purchased. it has faded to a dark charcoal grey over about 15-20 washes, and i always wash on cold/cold, and dry everything as a delicate.<br />i still love these shorts and havnt found another pair of 3/4 shorts that can compare, these are authentic ripstop material and that was the most important thing to me.<br />i use these when i go mountain biking, i like the leg coverage and still being able to get flow to keep cool<br />some days i will tuck them into my knee pads and it leaves plenty of fabric left to give me range of motion but keeps the dirt out of my crotch lol.<br />these shorts have really toughed it out i just purchased these pants from amazon at the end of last week for airsoft (along with the jacket).  while i have yet to actually use them on the field, they appear to be well made, and the digital woodland pattern is very sharp.  at first i wasn\\'t sure that i would like it, however, upon seeing it in person i can safely say that i made a good decision.  my only slight qualm about these pants is that they were quite large in the waist.  i\\'m about six foot one with a 36in waist and 34in length.  while the length was spot on, the waist was very large.  it still works well with a tight belt, but those considering these pants should keep this in mind when ordering. god, i\\'ve been buying this style pant from gosoftware for years and years. the cotton adjusts to your body over time, so when you put them on, they meld to the unique shape of your body. in recent years, they seem to have upped the cotton piling because i just got 2 more pairs as gifts and i am loving how much heavier they are without turning in to a sweat pant (which no one should wear in public period) comfortable, easy to travel in, gym, pj\\'s, dancing with yourself in the living room while no one is watching ... they\\'re really comfortable on all levels. my only gripe, they\\'re always too long so watch those dangling hems on the back of your shoes! my 14 year old daughter needed new pajamas as hers were getting small and tight.she is into leopards and skulls.they are a christmas present for her love them they fit me im 5\\'3 90lbs. they fit slightly looser than a glove, but i like that!!! comfy, cute. the skeleton one in b/w is ehat i got!! fast delivery and good fit they fit like and look like the ones from the store. they are too heavy for summer in ga but fine for winter. i received my tru-spec multicam pants today and while i really like them they are way, way to long for me.  the amazon sizing chart on the product page does not list any dimensions for waist and inseam beside the standard sizes.  they list different pant sizes of xs, s, m, l, xl and on and on with waist and inseam dimensions were as the amazon sizing chart shows; xs, xsl, s, sl, ms, m, ml, ls and more but does not list any waist and inseam dimenstions.<br /><br />i also noticed that of the two reviews posted on the pant\\'s site one of them complains of the pants being too long as well.  i will be returning my pants for a shorter pair.  otherwise they are a great pair of pants i would have just like a little more clarification on the possible sizes. nice this was a gift for a friend. she wears them at her university all the time. they fit nicely. the only downside is i\\'m 5\\'6&#34;, i ordered a medium, and they are a bit too long for me. other than that, the material is thick and wonderful for cold nights. i would definitely recommend these to a family member or friend! these pants are great.  they really do work.  only issue is that they are kind of noisy when you walk, not noticeable at the gym because there is a lot of noise anyways.  overall, very happy with them.  i recommend. order a size smaller than normal, they do run big.  i read reviews and got the smaller size and they fit perfect. as expected from propper, their acu trousers are well-made, ruggedly-constructed, and ready to take a pounding.  these trousers fit well and are comfortable, too.  i highly recommend them. these pants fit beautifully. even though i\\'m only 5\\'4&#34; i have a hard time getting fitness pants that are long enough. these are even a tiny bit too long. that\\'s not a complaint! the material is thicker than other brands and softer at the same time. i\\'m not crazy about &#34;fold over&#34; waist bands, they\\'re usually &#34;rollover&#34; waistband. the waistband on these pants stays where it\\'s supposed to when i\\'m working out. overall, i\\'m really happy withe the fit and quality of these pants. i\\'d definitely buy them again. the sound of stitches popping and threads breaking as i pulled them on makes me think they won\\'t last long without needing repair. but they are super soft. still think i would have gone a size up though because of how much they show in the crotch area. i went to scotland and forgot to buy the red (campbell type) plaid pants. i took a shot and ordered online because the price was fair. i\\'m not a hippy size girl, so i ordered the mans small size.  when they arrived, they were stiff but i soaked them overnight in a sink with about 1/4 cup of hair conditioner.  i washed them on a gentle cycle with fabric softener and very little soap, then tumble dried them.  everything was perfect. the size, length, feel and now i have my rock look that i wanted by added my chain belt hooks. \\\\m/ bought 5 different prints for the wife, all look great on her and wash nicely, but the white shows through to her panties. she solves the problem by putting cute shorts over them.  she doesn\\'t wear them often but she likes every print we bought.  worth the money. my bf and i think the bow is one of the cutest parts on the pants. i wear flashy things well. the pants are super soft and light. perfect for summer, if they stay on!! (very sexy too!) warm, comfortable and have lasted through one long winter, so far this was one of the cutest outfits i\\'ve ever bought for him!  it was so very nicely made and fit very well. i think that these pants have a slimming effect.  i have wide hips and thick thighs.  the pants fit well without being too snug.  i wish the extra large came in some other colors.  seem to have a quality construction. they are what they were presented to be. i am pleased. these are nice and warm johannes falk from sweden here. these were delivered very fast, a week or so ahead of schedule. i must admit i had second thoughts about it, but when i unpacked the and put them on there was no more doubt. these were the pants for me.  some details that are not in the product description:  there are five pockets in total. four at the front, one at the back. the upper two front pockets and the one in the back all have buttons to keep them shut. the lower two front pockets have only a flap that can be folded over the opening to prevent stuff from falling out.  the product description is a little of on one point: these are most clearly summerwear. the won\\'t keep you warm in the winter but on hot summer days they will fill all the sweaty people around you with envy!  even though they are 65% polyester they don\\'t feel that... sticky that synthetic materials tend to do.  but all else aside, this is freedom of movement like you\\'ve never known it before. i use mine as everyday wear as well as trainingwear.  good stuff for a good price! this outfit is super warm and snuggle. also very easy for a newborn that still needs belly button care. fit great.  love it!! i started using gerber training pants when my daughter was 20 months old.in a few days she was good with training  and stopped liking any diapers. by the time she was 2 1/2 she got completely potty trained. also she started wearing these in the night too. it can hold pee if its  a small one. it would leak if it was a big one. i love those and used for a very long time. i couldn\\'t compare this with any other brand as this was the only one we tried.<br /><br />i feel they should have made bigger ones too, up to 6t. once in a while when there is an accident in the night now(she is 4 now)i miss these.<br /><br />i would recommend buying the next size as i found their suggested size small. gerber training pants were  our  true potty training buddy. this is cut extremely small. china size. cheaply made. bad material. they are very comfortable, fits true to size, hugs the booty perfectly and not see through. i will buy more. very roomy and just the right colors.<br />and the cargo pockets! exactly what i need for my job as i carry lots of stuff with me.<br />highly recommended<br />downside: be careful if you work with bleach as it will force you to order more pants. outstanding quality and fit. these pants fit well, rugged made and free of defects.  i needed something that would blend into the environment while taking photos of wild animals and these do the trick. i am pleased with my perchance. very nice to wear. worn as a under a wind prof lair very comfy.<br />have slept in snow 10 degree in a mil sleeping system and was very warm. now these are harem pants! perfect amount of droop in the crotch, the material is soft and stretchy, they look the same as they do in the picture. they\\'re a little thin, but i fixed that by adding leggings underneath for winter. they\\'re gonna be perfect for spring and summer. i would totally order more like these! basically underwear - boyshorts more than hot pants. very cute/not uncomfortably tight (i weigh 140) the pants fits perfect,the fabric is soft,really nice for the summer and comfortable i love this item. good pants they are amazing.  they\\'re comfortable, versatile (durable enough for a hike, but classic/business casual enough for wearing to work), breathable, and did i already say amazing?  they smooth lumps and bumps and have a curve-flattering fit.  great staple, for sure!  i own these in gravel (a greenish-gray) and black.  i would buy in every color if they came out with more:) very happy with the product, they are a great gift for nostalgic friends and sports fans. i will definitely be buying more during the holidays. a little thin but did the job under costume very pleased with this purchase! a little long for my 5\\' 2&#34; but i love love love these have ordered 3 more different styles!! my girlfriend loves these.  simple, inexpensive, and fits great.  sexy these are really comfortable and fit well. my boyfriend loves them on me. i knocked off a star because they are mildly see through. if you have writing on your panties, it may be legible. however, if you wear solid colored undies, you can\\'t tell they are see through.<br /><br />all in all, i will be purchasing another pair because i like the yoga pants more than most i\\'ve tried. i love them they are comfortable but thin fabric was hopping for thicker delivery only took three days if that the color is more like a green i ordered midnight teal i could live with them just wish it was more of a durable fabric i could wear them to bed they are so comfy though i would recommend to anyone i call these my cock fight pants. i know what you are thinking, why cock fight? why not zebra fight pants? here, let me explain:    the first time i wore these pants, i tried to capture the spirit of the animal print from which they came: the zebracorn (50% zebra / 50% unicorn = 100% real. see google). i would wear these pants with nothing more than crocs on my feet and hair on my chest, and prance around the block like the mighty, legendary zebracorn. it was kind of like skipping, using an intermittent hop, kind of a gallop. yes, definitely a gallop. and i held my hands in front of my chest like i wasn\\'t exactly sure what to do with them. people would ask if i was gay as i pranced around. i\\'d smile, wave, and wish them a happy day too. then one day my friend explained to me that those people used a redefined meaning of that word. i didn\\'t know they did that! (change word meanings, i mean.)    so i got worried. no more prancing around the block. to help protect myself from the block bullies who changed words, i decided to take capoeira lessons. i wore these pants to every lesson. for years worth of lessons, my pants never failed me. they didn\\'t fade, and the stripe lines never blurred. my confidence roared, like a zebracorn! i was so elite that i entered every street fighter contest and won!    i became so confident that people began to call me \\\\\\\\\"cocky\\\\\\\\\". i tried to get them to call me \\\\\\\\\"corny\\\\\\\\\" in respect to the legendary zebracorn, but it didn\\'t work. eventually the name \\\\\\\\\"cocky\\\\\\\\\" grew on me. i decided to officially adopt it and took on the street fighting name of giant cock. my logo was a cock with a pirate\\'s eye patch. i shaved it into my chest hair! it looked so good with these pants. the women flocked to me like hens. i asked if they wanted to be my towel girls. they said yes! they were so proud to be able to towel the sweat off the giant cock after a fight.    in my youth i was strong and stood tall. but after years of fighting, and just plain old age, i had problems staying up against almost any opponent and would get knocked out easily. usually less than one round. i had to retire. as a sign of my past life behind, i burned my cock fight pants at sea. there were no ashes, just melted goop.    now, after breakthroughs in science and bad economies, i\\'m so happy to see these pants make a come back. i\\'ve been going through physical therapy, taking steroids, and have started fighting again. i couldn\\'t find a cock t-shirt to symbolize the rebirth of my career, but i found a wolf one! [[asin:b000esjlbw breakthrough wolf t-shirt - available in various sizes]] but i still wasn\\'t complete without my zubaz! i ordered a pair, and am waiting for delivery. very soon the giant cock shall return!    order a pair of zubaz pants and you too can be a giant cock!    pros: turns you into a giant cock. doesn\\'t burn easily.  cons: none! so slimming. they are a  great medium weight and a true color. they don\\'t wrinkle and should travel well packed in the suitcase. i will never buy any other yoga pants. these are long enough and not see through. i have 2 pairs love them so much i purchased these pants for my boyfriend for a snowtubing and ski trip. i was looking for something inexpensive since i was not sure if we would like the snowtubing/skiing experience. i expected the pants to be a little bit on the cheesy side with a very thin fleece lining--but these pants were anything but that. i could not wait to get them home today so that i could try them on myself so i tried them on at work and they felt and looked good. i am very happy with the purchase of these pants and if they do not fit my boyfriend, i will gladly claim them as my own. the waist fit well.  i do like how the pants contour to my physique.  i would recommend this nice brand. order a size down. these run very large. love it really nice pants and very warm, would recommend them! got this for a cosplay i am doing and i gotta say its exactly what i wanted. thanks nice color, style and fit.  would buy again. too long to come but still fresh tho üëå sexy fit<br />i\\'m glad i bought them<br />i\\'m 5\\' 6&#34; , 147-150 lb and they fit great.<br />the only problem<br />they are a little to sexy...lol! these are my new favorite maternity pants! i\\'m pregnant with my 3rd child and needed some new pants. i started wearing them in my 1st tri and have continued all the way through my 2nd. they are so fashionable!  they are true skinny jeans. basic comfy sweatpants. not amazingly soft or particularly well made, but good enough for a pair of branded sweat pants. a little large but they will be fine because i got a sewing machine for christmas! i really like these pants.  i\\'ve been wearing non-stretchy jeans, but i\\'ve been gradually switching to jeggings.  these are some of the most comfortable jeans i\\'ve purchased.  i highly recommend them and the price is right! these sexy shorts fit just like i hoped and are very pretty and sexy.  great for a night out on the town! our daughter was fully potty trained, day and night, by twenty months. i think these underwear really helped that. we were using cloth diapers, and she hated that wet feeling, so we switched to these to avoid using any kind of training diaper/pants that had absorption. these have just enough padding to contain an accident, but are really just regular underwear. i highly recommend these. love the shorts, love the material but the medusa looked like<br />med u s a.<br />this isn\\'t my first purchase from them they do have good stuff!<br />i hope i just got a bad one. lol<br />i loved the shorts so much i found a way to make it work! i  just pinched and sowed two parts together and you can\\'t tell at all.<br /><br />before an after picture below.<br /><br />u.s med the waist is perfect, legs could be skinner.<br /><br /> i love your guys stuff and style, step it up a little more and you guys got it!<br /><br />i will be back soon, thank you as a member of the mounted posse we are really ruff on uniforms, these pants look nice, do not wrinkle easily, lots of pocket storage space, great fit.. all around the perfect uniform pants these leggings are a good fit and good quality.  the brown color that i ordered was not a great color though.  i was hoping for more of a chocolate brown.  it\\'s lighter and has a green hue to it. very warm and fits well. my reason for 4/5 stars is that the color is a bit faded (gray-ish and not black in color). it looks like the leggings were used or washed. overall good fit. best jeans ever!  between a 2 and a 4; got the 4 - perfect!  this brand is my favorite!  very comfy; nonbinding. love these! they fit amazing and make my butt look so good. they are super stretchy and comfortable. i have another pair of u-turn jeans which i love but i have to keep pulling them up. with these jeans they stay up. will defiantly be buying another pair. this product was received early and was exactly as described.  it is very well made. cream and black- not pink. the bamboo fabric is light weight, soft and lays very nice. these are some of our favorite summer<br />pants! just wish they made them larger this is the only kicky pants item i have bought where the sizing seems to be off. i have bought 6-12 month for my chubby 4 month old in many other items and they fit great, but this dress is huge on her. such a cute line--cute colors, awesome fabric, i would definitely recommend it. i love it! looks just like the picture! i bought them for dance practice so ill be wearing mostly flats. they fit well and are a very soft and comfortable material. i am 5\\'4 so my only complaint is that they are about 2 inches too long. they would probably be the perfect length if i was wearing them out with heels. great item, would like elastic on the bottom of the leg cuffs. sorry i mixed up the reviews. the top was great the bottoms were a little large in the waist. the pants fit me a bit snug in the legs, more than what i\\'m used to in a yoga pant. i love the waist line and the color. but overall, i do like them. comfortable but a little snug. next time i\\'ll have to order a size bigger. i like my yoga pants a little loose to bend in, so i don\\'t feel like my air supply is being cut off. i love them! straight up i them and i\\'m so eager to wear them tomorrow with my new shirt and bandana. you might find a picture of me in them on twitter and facebook. #swag #4real so comfy and adorable on i have worn shadowline underwear for many years, and i had thought they had gone out of business, but was pleasantly surprised to find them still on the internet. way way too long unless you\\'re 5\\'10&#34; or taller but after fixing that they are great! really love them. they are long. i\\'m just about 5\\' 5&#34; and they took some getting used to. would buy again though. these pants are very comfortable after i had them hemmed nine inches shorter!  (i always expect to hem pants because i\\'m a short, heavy woman, but i found a tailor who only charges $5 to hem pants)  the material is comfortable and they\\'re just right in fit around my body. these pants came to me exactly how i would have imagined them. the pockets are a little awkward if you don\\'t have your hands in them like the picture does but otherwise the fit is exactly what it says it\\'s to be. the material is a bit heavy but at the same time breathable and by all the means comfy. i was very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend these to anyone whom ejoyed this kind of style. :) love it i bought a bunch of these for my son. he\\'s worn them for months, and they\\'e holding up great. the colors are cute and don\\'t seem to have faded even though they\\'ve been washed a bunch of times. so comfortable! as pants go, these are... pants.  they\\'re well constructed and they look good.  the material is somewhat soft to the touch, and liquids tend to roll off before they have a chance to absorb, which is nice.  the pockets button through loops attached to the flaps, rather than through slits.  this is a little hard to get used to, but it gives a unique look.<br /><br />on the downside, the front pockets are a little shallow, so expect to lose spare change in your couch and car pretty frequently.<br /><br />the other major disappointment is the belt.  it\\'s a nice belt at first examination, frayed at the edges for the \\\\\\\\\"destroyed\\\\\\\\\" look.  however, during wear, the belt sheds little fibers, and begins to fray further.  in my case, after half a dozen wearings or so, the belt has unraveled a full quarter of the way along its original width.  a few more wearings and it will fall apart completely, i\\'d imagine.<br /><br />you might get a few good wearings out of the belt, but don\\'t expect to keep it long.  and definitely don\\'t let the inclusion of the belt be a selling point, because you\\'ll find yourself sorely disappointed. the medium fit nicely for my husband who normally wears size 34x32 comfy and true to color this little set is perfect. it is soft, and fresh looking. it is perfect for someone who is into organic items. highly recommend i wish i had tried roseate emoji joggers from the beginning. great quality , and great fit.  jackie very well made, nice design, true to size.  material a little thin, but nice. soft material that is thick enough so that your underwear doesn\\'t show (i read some reviews of other types of pants that had that problem). i ordered a large one, but i think a medium would have been fine, since the length is about half an inch longer than i would like it to be and the material is stretchy enough. i\\'ve been wearing it around the house and it doesn\\'t slide down my hips. for a more casual thanksgiving dinner, i wore it with a nice tunic and ballet flats. i plan to order another one. i am loving my leggings. makes me sweat like crazy when i go for walks or do exercise.  i don\\'t perceive any smell and they hand wash easily. they dry fast and kept their shape after wash excelent products quick delivery. pants fit well and are comfortable.  i have washed them once, and they came through nicely. super soft and warm! out with the old and in with the new. i always knew multi-cam will be more used and known after that stupid digital camo crap they used to give us in the fob. because in the real world black and digital colors doesn\\'t exist, period. my granddaughters loved it was good fit. sturdy material for lightweight polyester, well-sewn. i didn\\'t want tights but rather close-fitting pants, and that\\'s what the medium size is on my 5\\'9\\\\\\\\\", 145lb frame (i wear 30\\\\\\\\\"x30\\\\\\\\\" jeans). there is no fleece in these; they are about triple thickness compared to my midweight polypropylene thermal baselayer pants.<br />i suggest cool weather vs cold weather based on my cold tolerance (i don\\'t often run below freezing), but your mileage may vary.<br />i\\'m in the us and got these in about a week from the uk. i love them! they\\'re comfortable and they\\'re made out of a sturdy fabric! a must-have! super cute, nice and snug, arrived in about a week. i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; and thin and the size small fit me perfectly. no complaints yet, we\\'ll see how they come out after i wash them! *update, bought a 2nd pair and they are exactly like the ones i got last time, perfect fit! they are my favorite yoga pants ever. super comfy. i would have given 5 stars but there is a hole in one of the pockets. i\\'ll never use them but i\\'m sure some people do. the size is perfect i never bought red pants and for some crazy reason, i bought these and love them! they have faded somewhat to a rose red pink, which i\\'m ok with. the hardest part for me is finding the right shirt to wear with them. they are more and more comfortable the more i wash them and they fit great! good length for me (i\\'m 5\\'6&#34;) pants look great but legs are tighter than a previous size medium i had. i got this with the toddler 2t 3t shocking pink / white houndstooth clip on bow tie,n white jeans for easter sunday for my 3mnt old baby boy n he was the cuties baby ever the bow tie had everyone going nuts.i will b ordering more from them when needed perfect fit!  thanks so much! i read the other reviews  and knew i would need a size larger, i wear a 9 but ordered a large. i am very pleased , very good value. these are more of a jegging they are thicker material than legging also dresser. i have no complains. love them:) they are just fine. all that they state is true and correct. i was a size 14 before my pregnancy, and i\\'m now in my seventh month. these pants fit wonderfully, and they\\'re lightweight, so they\\'re perfect for wearing to the office in the texas summer heat. they\\'ve also held up well after several washings. totally worth the price; love them. they fit well, but the colors are slightly different the the picture - a little more dull and maybe a few shades darker for the peach color. the pants are also thinner than i expected. i was looking to replace a pair of pants that i have worn for about 7 years. they were so worn that you could see through them - no longer appropriate for public viewing! i saw these and decided i\\'d give them a try, and i must say they are fabulous. i love the flow of them and the fact that the waistband is tight enough that the pants aren\\'t falling off by the end of the day, and they are very slimming. they are an inch or two too long for me, but i\\'m only 5\\'1. i just wear my wedges with them and i have no problems. these are comfortable enough to wear around the house, professional enough for work, yet elegant enough to wear them at a dinner party or even a wedding. i\\'m definitely ordering another pair soon. love it lots of accessories nice i love these. they\\'re great! i\\'ve been wearing alfred dunner all elastic waist pants for a long time.  i bought them through amazon because of  the color as macy\\'s didn\\'t have in my size - spetite.  i recommend them for comfort and style.  csb weston, fl., awesome i like it very much! i like how the legging is made of leather very nice! they are low rise and fit very snug, but that is exactly how i hoped and expected them to fit. exactly as described. genuine military issue. brand new. perfect fit for me. used to own a woodland camo and it lasted many years. i used it for working around the yard, the garage and for hiking. very good quality. i\\'m buying another pair to make sure i always have good trousers ready for any tough job i need to do. 12 year old daughter love love loves them and so comfy!!! these pants are very comfortable to wear around the house; and i often sleep in them. the pant legs are a bit long, but that it\\'s remedied by rolling them up. overall i am pleased with my purchase. those are really comfortable the length is right i\\'am 5foot6 a little see trough but not a problem for me yes i will buy from this seller again i\\'ve been searching for reasonably priced, well fitting yoga pants for years. i love these. i\\'m 5\\' 1&#34; and they drag on the floor a bit, but i only wear them indoors and i like them that way.  highly recommend. good even though they are a bit large. did like great price, love the color! it\\'s a bit hard to get into and take off but that\\'s as expected with tight tights i guess. i like em! great price for the quality. not too thin  and not too heavy. very comfortable along with a good quality product. better than walmart sweats in addition to representing the corp.! used as work pants for about 4 years now.  the crotch patch wore and is hanging, nothing that can\\'t be fixed.  would buy again! i love these pants.  they fit great, wear very well, look fantastic, and are made in america.  best pants i own. my order got here 2 days early, and has great quality. they keep me warm and comfortable. i honestly couldn\\'t be happier with these pants. i love my legging, i will be buy any pair soon. these are a soft and lighweight spring/summer pant. cute little pocket on the back. comfy and giving..a nice change instead of tight leggings or shorts. good quality in a very light material; a little bit more see-through than pix shows, but not a big deal. great little throw on pants that could be worn anywhere. pretty pastel colors. i bought both the blue and the pink for my 15 month old granddaughter. good fit, and have room for diaper without being too loose. cant believe the awesome price, and that you get two pair in the package. great deal! will be buying more. i\\'ve been getting into jumpers recently and decided to try this one. i know it says that it fits 6-16, but i imagine that it would fit a 4 (and perhaps a 2, albeit loosely) as well. the top part is snug on me and i don\\'t wear it on my waist. when i fold it over, it cuts the fat on my bottom (there isn\\'t a lot!) and looks silly. i only wear it as a full jumpsuit.<br /><br />i wash this in cold water and dry it on medium heat only about halfway to keep it from getting too wrinkly, then i hang dry it.<br /><br />the first day i wore this i had three random compliments while walking in my neighborhood. being that it\\'s cotton, breathes, and is cute (and i got so many compliments!), i purchased an olive green one too, which i love just as much! both look cute with a scarf or shawl (or if it\\'s hot, you don\\'t need anything). i absolutely love these pants. they are very stretchy and fit me perfect. i am a bit big weighing about 185 and ordered the large which was the biggest size they had. to my surprise the pants fit with no problem. i would highly recommend them. at first i thought the price was a bit much, and on arrival i believed the buckle looked a little small but i soon learned i was wrong on both points. the belt is made out of great material and solid metal for the buckle like a real seat-belt. there isn\\'t a thread out of place and is well worth the price. i soon realized that if the belt buckle had been any bigger then the insert side of the seatbelt wouldn\\'t be able to fit in normal sized belt loops. even after all my doubts it will be a great addition to my deputy deadpool cosplay.<br /><br />so in short:<br />- strong material<br />- no scratches or loose threads<br />- great design<br />- tight fit for normal belt loops<br />-highly recommended for cosplayers and comic book fans alike. i got two sets of this scrubs for work. the sizes are good, the color holds after washing, and they look also very nice. okay so these pants are great! and one thing i didn\\'t notice mentioned, they have pockets! which are also great!<br />the one thing i could complain and warn about is the pants come a lot shorter than you would expect. i\\'m 5\\'8&#34;, female. i am normally a small, but i ordered a medium just to be sure and still they came an inch above my ankles. fast shipping nice fit yoga pants looks just like the photo.  mine fit a tiny bit loose around the very top, but i assume that\\'s because i\\'m skinny (5\\'6, 105ish).  the leggings are just thick enough to not be see through.  they\\'re more spandex based.  very stretchy.  long enough to hit my ankles as they should.<br /><br />they did pill a little in the front, because i wore them to work and do physical labor.  if you\\'re doing anything in them where you might rub against something, they\\'ll probably pill (not terribly, but you\\'ll notice some wear). perfect for under the girls cheer uniforms! both girls are small between sizes 14/16 - size 1. neither of them have problems with the size. we have even ordered these twice! loved them so much after the first wear, we bought more to have! the cargo pants are great.  good detail. love the colors, just as appears on website.  the fit is ideal and they are so light!  they move well too. i bought three pairs of pants for work. one had a bleach stain on them and the first time i put them on the drawstring broke in half before i even left my house. so i was kinda bummed obout that. but then the company offered me a new pair of pants free of charge plus a discount on my next purchase. i am very pleased on how they handled this matter. very cute but it runs small. my baby wore it when he was almost 4 mos. and it was really tight. i just wanted something comfortable for a grab and go outfit. they are thin, but not so thin you see through them. they are cotton so not preferred on hot days, but i\\'m in the middle east so it\\'s rarely that it\\'s cool here. like it comfy and stylish excellent product.! love them! we\\'re a little big without washing but once washed they fit great! absolutely wonderful, fit well & very comfortable. i bought these as a sweatpants alternative to wear when i am either at home relaxing or running errands.  they are very comfortable, they fit nicely, and (most importantly) they are not see-through.  i would definitely recommend these! it\\'s in between a regular underwear and a really thick training underwear, and just right. my son has been wearing them for 8 months or so now and we use them like regular underpants. it\\'s nice when they have accidents. not as messy as the regular thin cloth underwear. my son needed this cause he\\'s taking a while to train, especially the #2. fit great ugh i wish these made my crotch look better, i had to return it, but their high waist shorts, fabulous fits great ! nicely made ! happy with item :) i was very pleased with my order.  my order meet my expectations.  i really like how my order fits and looks on me. i like the pants and i see that not only are they great pants but they have found a way to bring all the losers out with their pathetic reviews. mine are a little long but thats to be expected from men\\'s clothing. i love them they are so comfy i love the lettering and that they arnt super thick. these are by far my favorite yoga pants and best fitting too!  very disappointed that i cannot find these to order anymore! these pants fit really well and are very comfortable. definitely quite true to size. i especially like how the lengths are adjustable for different looks. i think the most exciting thing about these pants is that they look just like my regular cargo pants and not like some other frumpy maternity pants that i\\'ve seen out there. these will definitely be a staple for the next few months! for the price, good deal, delivered quickly. not as useful as first thought it does protect your lady part home button from getting accidentally pushed.  plus don\\'t they look nice lovely. perfect fit. good feel. this costume is very nice as far as the \\'look\\' of it goes, it has a nice satin feel to it to. i also like that this is not very thick or lined in any way because it keeps the jacket lightweight and will keep you from getting too hot at a halloween party. i didnt give it the fifth star because for the price, it doesnt feel like it will hold up for very long after you party in it, but still all in all a great costume to look like a playboy for a night. i love these pants! fyi... the material is very thin and somewhat see through so keep that in mind. perfect for summer though! also if you are tall these will not make it to your ankles, lucky for me i have a 29 inch inseam so they fit perfectly. my son absolutely loves them but it took too long for delivery. it was a gift. & he didn\\'t get them for a whole month! i\\'m curvy with a little tummy and love-handles and i often have problems finding pants that flatter me in the right way, most of the time if i find pants that make my butt look good they give me a muffin top in the process. these pants are awesome and make my butt look great and don\\'t emphasize my unwanted areas. they are super comfortable and feel like you are wearing yoga pants like most people have said, these are a soft cotton fabric and not a jean at all. i am 5\\'2&#34; and 135 lbs and wear a size 11 in most junior sized jeans/pants, the large fit me perfectly. i was tempted to order xl due to all the reviews saying they run small but i\\'m glad i didn\\'t because it would have been to big. these are junior sized so just follow the junior size chart and you should be ok. they are a little on the long side for me because i am pretty short, but it\\'s no big deal. you will get plenty of compliments in these cozy pants! they shipped out super fast, i got them 3 days after i ordered them with the slowest/cheapest shipping option picked. i liked them so much that i promptly went to their website and ordered 3 more pairs. you won\\'t be disappointed with these pants. these pants are so soft and light. they are roomier at the bottom. but i wore them for zumba and i loved them. they were comfortable and easy to dance in i love these so much!!!!! they fit perfect. they were true to size! they are comfy and stretchy for thick girls i wear a size 15 in juniors, ill ded. buy from them again these are really freaking cute. i expected them to be a vinyl type material, but they were actually a metallic looking polyester. they are very thin and show the bumps and curves around my hips. i actually found that wearing regular leggings underneath helped smooth them out some. overall i think they will do a great job for the biker chick look i\\'m going for. i\\'m 5\\' 1&#34; 125 lbs and wear a size 4. i bought this for my wife along with http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b00grhc3zk/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s01?ie=utf8&psc=1 and she loves them! when she put them on she told me, &#34;i am now going boldly... to bed!&#34; they do like to zap you, though, when moving around on a microfiber couch. my mom loves alfred dunner clothing because they fit her nicely and they are hip for the older lady.  she needs short not petite dress pants and there aren\\'t many stores that carry dunner (here in the southern states) and short or smalls.  i need to order them, which is a putty.  the line is very nice, reasonably prices and stylish. i just love how these pants look! i mean, they are totally wicked and whatnot, but they could be more of a blood red color for the thread. the cross on the back could also look more gothic. but overall, i give them 5 stars only because they are tripps! tripps forever! very nice product - fit perfectly.  very fast delivery. excellent love this outfit! great belt and the only problem i have is it looks smaller than the picture. but the belt is very stylish and very nice i\\'m a college student so i don\\'t have a lot of money but as it was getting cooler i realized i needed some warmer clothes to sleep in, especially since my apartment is very drafty. after reading the reviews i decided to order one pair (the owls!) in a medium, i\\'m 5&#34;5\\' and they are a bit long but very comfortable.  they are soft and warm but not super thick which is nice for sleeping. i will probably be ordering at least one more pair soon. the fit is tts. washed according to instructions and colors did not fade or bleed. colors are just as bright as the picture. my favorite part was the paper packaging it came in. i love a company that cares for the environment. they fitted perfect.  i am a short pirate 5\\'4&#34; and a little round so i ordered the l/xl i have reviewed this item before and will do so again here because these gauze harem pants are the best! i have purchased several pairs for myself and well as a gifts for friends and family. they are a big hit every time! launder gently they will last a very long time. they are super-cute, will fit just about anyone, are unique and comfortable beyond words. the seller is absolutely excellent, the item ships very fast and i\\'d give the seller and the item 10 stars if i could! thank you india shakti! l love this pants. soft and comfortable on the body. perfect as beach resort wear. received many compliments on it. this outfit is sooo adorable - can\\'t wait till the granddaughter can fit into.  she will be styling at the daycare. love these - will be ordering in other colors ! great for removing panty line, leg hem seam a bit too thick for wearing under tight fit dresses i love my leggings just what i wanted!!! great fit, they looks good. i just didn\\'t like that the strings were sent out of the pants and i had to lace them up myself.  i did both legs and realized i did the lacing wrong i put the tie at the bottom and not the top like the pic and had to redo them that was a pain in the butt, other then that they are nice, sexy pants love.these.pants.... rugged and comfortable. i\\'ll be adding a few more pairs to my dresser soon. small is too large in the hip area. petite runs very long. i took the to get altered. overall the pants were cute. it may say that on the tag but i didnt read it. dont put in dryer because they do shrink a bit. bought this as a gift for my daughter.  she wears a size 5 jrs.  since everyone said in the reviews that the outfit runs small,  i ordered the medium in navy blue.  my daughter loved it.  it fits just like she wanted it which is cut short on the waist and the sleeves are &#34;narrowish&#34;.  you would usually wear it unzipped with a tank top.  the bottoms fit her a little long- she \\'s 5\\'5&#34;- but we have not washed /dried them yet.<br />  overall the fabric and color seem nice.  not as plush as designer  brand but also not as $$$. the pants are good quality for polyester. leg size is very long and had to be shortened for me (i wear a 32 inseam), but that was the only alteration. these are stretchy pants and they fit snugly for me, but just the look i wanted. moderately bell-bottomed, but not excessively so. the material is a bit thin and probably not highly durable, but fine for occasional use i would guess. muy buen producto, buen vendedor y entrega uy rapida muchas gracias .. lo tendre en cuenta para proximas compras .. got these for my wife for chirstmas, very soft and comfortable. she loves them! great deal on them for the price. love it! i absolutely adore these pants. they don\\'t ride up. they don\\'t fall down. the 4 pockets (2 zippered) give me plenty of room for things. the major bonus is the comfort. these pants move with you, and squatting down to do a dressing change or other nursing care is a total breeze. the waistband is also ultra comfortable. i was a fan of cherokee scrubs until i took a gamble on these scrubs, and now i\\'m a total convert. plus, every single day that i wear them, i get compliments and coworkers asking what kind of pants they are. :) great pants, great seller, what more could you want? i will be ordering more. i absolutely loved the fit, really cute!!! really comfortable, i\\'m ordering more colors!!! great first off, let me just say that this company\\'s customer service is outstanding. i work for a service company and i hope our customers think as highly of my company as i do of fashion2love. these people are super friendly, attentive, and exceeded my shipping expectations. i ordered wednesday, contacted them because  i was unsure about my size, they replied thursday, and i received my package saturday! yes, i purchased the cheapest shipping option. amazing!<br /><br />now, the product. simply amazing! i l-o-v-e my pants! they feel super comfortable, like yoga pants! i am a new mommy and am still trying to lose that little pooch (ladies, you all know what i am talking about). well, these pants help you suck that little pooch in and make your tush look fab! my husband loves them (yay me!).  the sizing is a bit tricky and i hope this helps all of you. my measurements are (not what they used to be pre-baby...hahahaha)  waist= 29 pooch=36 in., hips=39 and size large fits perfectly! it fits nice and tight, but relaxed enough in the waist/pooch area. i put in my pooch measurement (which i am not too happy about) because i think it makes a huge difference in the size of pants you are ordering. anyway, hope this helps! for the record, i love these so much, that i want to wait to lose the pooch before ordering a new pair! the red fold over pant is amazing! this is the exact color i was looking for and the fit is great! the material makes my body look great comfortable and sheer so they breath.  they flow and move great when you are dancing and look pretty as well. i bought these for work, i\\'m a massage therapist and very particular about comfort and being able to move easily while i work...these pants are perfect! i have never used this type of product before. i was seeking something for  compression and decided to give slim hot a try.<br />i go walking 2 to 3 miles twice a week. i have back and knee problems which can make comfort a challenge. the slim hot pant are constructed in a material similar to a wet suit. it\\'s sturdy construction helps support my back on legs which helps me achieve my activity goal. these pants will make you sweat! i notice the sweat within 10 minutes. they are a big improvement over those vinyl sauna suits popular in the 70\\'s.<br />some people might be put off by the thick material but i think the pants are worth a try. fits very well. i wear them often these pants are comfortable, look great and are easy to take care of. but i\\'m 5\\'6\\\\\\\\\" tall and i bought them for kundalini yoga class. so, i end up having to pull them up to right below my knee because otherwise they will run up by themselves. they basically only go halfway down my shin in length. so i wouldn\\'t buy them again for that reason, as i wish they would be ankle length. comfortable i adore this pair of pants . i\\'m 5ft and it looks awesome on not to mention original. works wonders with a black top and boots on. love it!! üòâ i just recieved my propper bdu multicam pants today andi must say if u re looking for great<br />quality at  reasonable price proppper is who u want. they fit perfectly and arrived very quickly. i wear a medium regular. and they fit just fine im 5 11. plenty of pockets for whatever u need them for and the material is tough as nails ....highly recommended. great! heavy weight & very comfortable. goes great with army sweat shirt i also purchased. my only negative: no pockets wish it had at least one pocket. really great summer pant, want to have more in different pattern im pregnant and can still fit my old yoga pants so i decided to buy more and this time in gray. love the fabric and the fit. they are a little long but i have short legs and am 5\\'5&#34; so all my pants are a little long. and by long i mean only slightly or barely at the bottoms of my feet/touching the floor.<br /><br />also i sometimes wear the waistband rolled up over my belly for support...and u cant see my underwear through it these pants are great, very nice and stretchy fabric. really comfortable, the only issue is that the color washed out too quickly, but other than that very great pants. love my smuggling duds they have a big hidden pocket very well made would buy again shipping was a bit high (from china), but even with that, this is a high quality outfit.  this is not is not a costume, but high quality chinese manufactured clothing.  it could be used for special occasions for years to come.  my son was very pleased, and he paid for it, or so he thought.  i paid him back for getting on the principle\\'s list at graduation,- required an a average for 4 quarters. the length at least in size xl are quite long.  other than that very comfortable.  very soft matrrial.i\\'d buy these again. i loved everything about the fit of the pants, except the length.  they were perfect, if they\\'d been 2 inches longer.  i have long legs and require a 33 inch inseam, which is often difficult to find in women\\'s pants.  they only have a 31&#34;, so i had to return them.  otherwise they were awesome.  i wish they came in lengths, and i also wish the inseam had been listed in the product details.  it would have saved me the time. they fit like a glove (: definitely one of my favorite pair of jeans! these were not made of the same material as earlier versions were, but they are quite comfortable. i did really love these yoga pants but unfortunately i have some cellulite on my thighs and the thin material showed every lump and bump. if you don\\'t have this problem then you should love these pants. the charcoal color is a little lighter than i expected, but still nice - the black color may not have shown the imperfections of my thighs as much. the length is 34&#34; - i\\'m 5\\'8&#34; and i would have needed to wear 4&#34; heels with them, which is fine for the yonger generation. these pants are really fabulous for someone who wants to show off a great body! i buy the fold over waist so i can pull the waist all the way up (no fold) and it covers my rather large belly with no &#34;muffin top&#34;! i have a pair of &#34;lands end&#34; yoga pants i bought years ago that are a lot thicker material and i just love them, but don\\'t see them on their website anymore - boo hoo. i\\'ll keep searching. my son wore this for his 2nd birthday party which had a spongebob theme!!! it fit very nicelt they fit great. i am 5\\'6, 130lb and the medium fit me well. i broke my arm and needed some pants that were easy to get on and off, comfortable and appropriate to where out without feeling sloppy. these are working out great for me. awesome, but heads up, they\\'re too small for most men to wear. your bits will tend escape out the top or side.  very sexy though :p.    i can\\'t complain about mini-booty shorts being too small though, so it\\'s 5-stars here. exactly the product i expected. i am about a size 0 and they fit me fine, definitely had room. look just like the picture described. shipping took a few days longer than expected but it was no big deal, they were friendly and helpful when i contacted them. i like these pants because they are very comfortable and feel great to the touch. i can also dress them up or down when time to potty train these and the gerber plastic pants go hand in hand  at night. so glad we were able to find these.<br />diapers and pull-up pants are made of the same type of fabric and can confuse toddlers when you are trying to potty train.<br />when not at home the throw aways are still good to have on hand. the fit is slightly loose.  the fabric is comfortable and also does not wrinkle easily.  these are my favorite pants in lieu of jeans. best workout pants i\\'ve purchased.  fit great.  stay in place.  perfect for zumba. very reasonably priced. very nicely made! they are spandexy & long. very pretty in person. i returned mine though, because they didn\\'t look good on me! i\\'m not meant to wear spandex! love it so much.looks very stylish love these pants! they\\'re super comfy, not too hot, and perfect for a deadpool fan. really cute, but a little small. the color of these was a little darker than i expected  and they are very , very long i will need have them cut and hem , i\\'m only 5 feet 1 inches and i don\\'t wear heels too often , these are definitely for tall gals , personally for my height this is not really an option for me , the delivery was on time if not early , just wish i was taller , they are very comfortable  and material is kind of thin for pants , hope this helps some one out there in deciding to shop on line for pants if your not the average person . i have purchased costume jewelry and scarfs and tops and had very good experience  , it is nice not to stand in line and being able to shop at any time of day or night makes life easier these pants fit perfect.  i saw a few reviews that mentioned they might be too see through.  i don\\'t see that at all.  i ordered a medium and i think the fit and thickness of the material are perfect.  they are very long on me and i will actually have to hem them but i\\'m only 5\\'2&#34; so that\\'s not the fault of the clothing.  they are incredibly comfortable for gym wear or home wear or even to wear out.  really a wonderful buy for a great price. bought this for my fiance and she looks smoking hot in it. 5 stars would buy again. going to order more in different colors.  fit light a glove.  enhance my bootie, which is basically flat now that i\\'m 71 y/o. love these pants! nice and light weight. they are alot more baggy than i thought they would be but still nice. i am very happy with this purchase and the pants definitely do what they say they will. even when i\\'m not being active these pants make me sweat. i feel like they are boosting my core temperature as well. these are definitely pants and not a capri. i\\'m 5\\'4&#34; and they fit from my waist to my foot with a couple of extra inches to spare. they are not too tight or too loose for my taste. the fabric does have a strong odor, but i always shower after i take them off anyway so that doesn\\'t bother me. i wear them under the old style yoga pants with the drawstring to avoid the noise that they make if your thighs rub. i\\'m very happy with the fabric quality, thickness and the overall fit. i\\'ve added a photo of my fingers through the ankle to illustrate thickness. can\\'t keep these away from my son...he enjoys them... i absolutely love these pants and have been wearing them to my tribal style belly dance classes.  i will say that they are a little long on me, and i am 5\\'6.  they are also a bit tight in the waist to the point where i have marks on my hips where they indent from the elastic, and i have a very slender build and a small waist so this surprised me.  the front ruching is a little baggy on me, but i don\\'t care.  i have been wearing these pants all over town and to class and receive many compliments.  i\\'m hoping the waist will stretch a bit with wear.  a very nice pair of dance pants for an outstanding price! these arrived from shanghai.  they are good quality.  however, they did smell badly of chemicals.  it\\'s a man-made material, but it smells like petro-chemicals.  i had to wash them several times and leave them to air.  takes a long time for the smell to disappear.  i\\'m am 4ft 8in and not heavy built.  they fit me with only a slight wrinkling at the ankle. love this outfit these underpants are awesome.  my daughter used them and i am back for more with my son!  they soak up more for beginning accidents.  the character ones are really thin can sometimes be scratchy.  these are very soft.  my only wish is that they had character versions.  i ended up fabric painting superman and batman logos onto the front of my son\\'s.  in my area you can only find them at target in the baby/burp cloth area and they are always out of stock.  that\\'s why i used amazon. i am 6\\'5\\\\\\\\\" and weight ~235lbs.  the pants i ordered were 40w x 36i.  they fit perfectly!  most importantly, my wife says they look good on my butt and she likes the color!  :-)  the pants are very well made.  i see no issues at the seams.  the snap is strong and additionally supported with a button.  the zipper is good quality and strong.  these are the first tactical pants i have ever purchased...so i can\\'t speak in comparison to other tac pants. it is nicely made and fits just right.  i was not sure at first if this would be the right size but the size 2 fits a 15 month old over her diaper.  it looks cute.  the delivery was also fast. great purchase....very cute, quick shipping.....happy!! i am 12 weeks, with my 4th. i\\'m starting to show a lot  sooner. these pants are perfect fit for me. the fabric feels cheap, but you really can\\'t go wrong for that price.  i washed them once so far and they wash great.  even the leg pleat stays in after washing.  there are no back pockets in these.<br />i definitely recommend these, i couldn\\'t find navy maternity capri pants anywhere else for under $100. very nice material  i am tall and the length was very good i ordered a size larger like you recommended and it\\'s perfect.  i like the color, fit, and feel of my new jogging suit.  and the best thing........it arrived earlier than promised.  win win. thank you very long needed to hem very cute!! i purchased a pair of these pants to go with the ubacs shirt the brits gave me in basrah, in 2009. the color and pattern works very well in the desert (much better than acu). however, i live in a temperate are. beware that if you want to dye these pants, they get dark very quickly.<br />the material is very lightweight and breathable. my granddaughter loves them and wears them regularly! these pants are super cute!  i love the long length and comfortable fit!  i plan on buying other styles.  very comfortable while letting me feel like i am dressed up!  extra long, but that was the look i was going for.  i am 5\\'6, and could wear these in wedges or heels. pants came on time and fit very well.the pants fit kind of snug on the waist but in no way were they deathly tight. the fabric is nice and smooth not unpleasant. my only complaint is that the pants aren\\'t really thick so if you do get them and it\\'s around the winter time or with cold or breezy weather it may be best to get a size up so that you can use layers. but the pants fit fine. the boot cut doesn\\'t flare out to much so i have no major complaints. there good 20$ pants. love the tights.i will always look on this website before going to a store to shop for something specific, they have a lot selections to choose from and the prices are great 5\\'7&#34; and 200 lbs, these fit great on me without being see through. i go to the gym 6 days a week and i love these! definitely ordering more! these jeans fit kinda snug when you first put them on, but they do loosen up the longer you wear them. they are great to wear to bed, around the house, or to town. the length is great for me and i am 5\\'7. overall, i am happy with them. the only reason i didn\\'t give them a 5 is because they are snug when you first put them on. these pants are great and they don\\'t look cheap! i purchased this gift for my niece and her husband who now live in vegas and are the proud parents of a gorgeous baby boy.  they love having an outfit without animals or sports teams, i will definitely be back for my new angel.<br />plus, since my niece is a graduate of unc she can have the colors without the tarheels printed across the front. they are both very pleased so therefore i give your product a five, have not heard any complaints!! this fits in the butt and legs, but it runs really long...like really long.  gonna have to have it taken up, but my wife likes them a lot, says they are comfortable...and they look amazing. these are without a doubt the most comfortable pants in the world. they are light and airy and perfect for hot weather and can be worn casually or dressed up. daughter loves them she wears them under her shorts for cheer , doing stunts this is just my size fits perfect and it is very comfortable too ! i defenetly buy more yoga pants here i\\'m very happy with the purchase love the material and color. not see through at all. a little baggy i usually get a medium in leggings but i guess i should\\'ve gotten a small. i\\'m 5\\' and 124 lbs love them, quick ship too i ordered these tights expecting to get them a month later and to be of poor quality being how cheap they were.  i was pleasantly suprised to get them a week later and to find they were not cheap looking at all.  i love these tights and would recommend my friends to buy!!!!! the pants were really comfy and the right size but completely different texture it is not a denim texture what soever more like velvet but i like them anyway i suggest getting them even if you don\\'t like velvet just because of how they fit love this fabric. so soft and silky. only wish it came in more colors. these pants are awesome if you need something that make you sweat a lot while exercising.<br />i wear them for jazzercise. excellent! super cute and comfortable!! i can know lift while obnoxiously showing my patriotism. these pants are so american that i want to invade a foreign country just to spread the american spirit. great buy! 10/10 great for the price. 100% cotton and different designs. love love love!!! love it. love wearing these with my infrared 6 and matching bucket. the colors are so vivid and the fit is great!!! if you are thinking about buying these...go for it, you will not be disappointed!! i first bought a couple of the leggings from amour/amazon and loved them so much i now have a collection of 14 pair and love everyone one of them. love hatley  pj\\'s - so soft, wears well and washes great. makes me feel as happy as my pj\\'s. strongly reccomend this whole line. smile, feel cozy and enjoy. we are new parents .. during my pregnancy,  it took me almost 3 months to select every thing for my baby ..cos i wanted everything perfect ..i loved it ... i got it for my two month old son ..it fits him so well .. n the fabric is nyc too.. its worth buying.. :)buy it if you think someone is gonna mess with you wearing these bad boys ...think again because they aren\\'t! not only did they fit me to perfection they fit me to perfection! i really can\\'t use enough exclamation marks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ok thats enough! get em don\\'t hesitate you will be sorry for the rest of your life! i mean if you don\\'t get em you will be sorry...thats what i meant! i\\'m in love with these pants. the black is my second pair. the look of the black pair is different from the dark grey pair that i bought previously, i feel like the black look a bit less casual which is fine with me. i\\'m 5\\' 6&#34; and the length of the pants come all the way down to my ankles. my hips are 37 1/2&#34; (sometimes 36&#34;) and the medium fits perfectly. they\\'re not too tight and have quite a bit of stretch to them, so they\\'re easy to move around in and even better is the fact that the back pocket is a decent size. they seem like they\\'ll be pretty warm during the winter months. i\\'m very pleased with these pants.  also, if you dry these pants expect some shrinkage. i made the mistake of drying the dark grey pair and now they slightly rise above my ankles which i don\\'t like. however, if you stretch them out while wet then it\\'ll give tyou a little of the length back, not a lot though. maybe drying them on low heat would be better but i would advise against testing that out, just hang them up.  i will definitely buy more in different colors! these are terrific. attractive and my \\'summer go to\\' this year! these yoga pants are wonderful!! they fit perfectly (short is still just a tad too long - i\\'m about 5\\'1) - love them!!!! ordered these for my teenage son.  he loves them!  the fabric is soft, the size is right, and the waistband comfortable.  he wears them constantly... i can barely get them off him long enough to launder them!  lol  the size has stayed true even after washing them several times. super great deal...thanks wore at a wedding this weekend.  perfectly fit and comfortable pair of pants. you can\\'t beat a pair of wourkout undies for 5 bucks.  product is great, and yes they are short-short, and seamless. thank you! it looks good but it\\'s weak if you aren\\'t careful with it. great pants este pantalon se ha convertido en uno de mis favoritos, estoy pensando en comprar otro, para asi tener variedad. espero las ofertas para decidirme a comprar. the elastic waist makes these shorts fit great. i am usually between a size 2 and 4 and i ordered a small. the lace is casual but chic. i can\\'t wait to wear them this summer. it is all good gear. my dad gets cold and these will keep him warm and comfy all winter long. great for the price, the material isn\\'t the best and is kind of cheap. fit very well, but was a good 5 inches or so too long so plan to get it hemmed if you aren\\'t above average height el producto es igual a la foto y estaba bien empaquetado y llego a venezuela en excelente estado gracias sigan asi i sewed them to fit me when i went to a semi-formal function. they are great. they fit really good and are really soft on the inside material. but they aren\\'t as high up the ankles like it shows in the picture. these are pants. these are great if you want your kid to look like he\\'s halfway dressed up and not wearing sweatpants all the time. you can fool them all by having a sharp dressed kid while he comfortably toddles around the house in a pant that have the comfort of sweats. the material is thin enough to allow for easy movement, but thick enough to keep the knees protected for crawling children. very comfortable and durable! pockets are placed perfectly, and can fit anything you could possibly need even as the biggest whacker in the department (i would know...). the ends fit perfectly over work boots (5.11 emt boots are what i wear, which are bulkier at the tops than most), and these have survived quite a lot. a great option! they are cheaper than most other places, but are a thicker fabric so definitely spend the extra money and get the lighter 5.11 ones or some shorts if it\\'s hot in your area! even for a man!!! i feared maybe i should give them to my sister if they didn\\'t fit as expected, but fortunately i will keep them!.<br /><br />people in the street turns to ask me where the hell they can get one! i really like these pants nice and &#34;airy&#34; for the summer time! i ordered a second pair.i want them in every color! great.  very comfortable. i have a pair in light grey that i wear all the time so i decided to get these. i have pretty long legs so i was presently surprised to find that the legs were still pretty long. for reference i\\'m 120lbs, 5\\'6ish. i got a small. very comfy, and perfect for yoga. (: love them. the purple will fade after about the 2nd wash (third time wearing them clean.)  size 38 which i am pushing fit\\'s very tight, but i still fit in them even though i have a little bit of a belly, but i\\'m not to chubby.  i usually blame the foreign countries for making size\\'s smaller than ours (usa), but honestly they do do run a little bit smaller.  i wear a 38, next time i\\'d order the 40 in case of shrinkage and weird foreign measuring systems, plus these pants have build in waist tighteners.  supper cool to wear around other geeks like myself, no one ever suspect\\'s that i\\'m in a military roll since i don\\'t know of any operations that could go on in a plum field.  i break allot of ice with women with this pants! ;)  otherwise, these are cool pants to wear in the fall or winter time, and i have fun every time i wear them! these pants are great!! they unzip into shorts and comes with the little pouches and looks as cool as it does in the picture! i\\'m 5ft 5in i weigh 110 and i bought a median, i normally bye a small, but i got a size up and they fit perfectly hands down, these threads are worth it! my jeans shipped to my house really fast so i definitely plan to purchase more.<br />also i will share a helpful tip. i ordered these in a size 36 and they fit great! however, i stand at 5\\'9 so i can tell you that at my height these pants have some extra length that drag on the ground even in my boots. dont let that stop you from buying these! i took them to an awesome friend of mine who works at a small independent tailoring shop and had her take a few inches off and now you can\\'t even tell i had them hemmed. they\\'re great now! so don\\'t hesitate! this is my second pair in a larger size (baby\\'s growing). very good especially for nighttime wear. best fit ever -thanks!<br />will be ordering more soon! as mentioned above, these pants look great. they\\'re solid basic pants. they\\'re not the most durable yoga pants, even in this price category. the fabric is thin and not particularly warm (beware if you\\'re buying for winter use or live in a cold climate) and i suspect that as i continue to use them for working out they\\'ll pill and/or split. i\\'ll update if that happens. the pajamas are soft, bright, and very feminine. i recommend this product to anyone with little girl. package arrived in exactly 2 weeks - one month before scheduled delivery!<br />i usually wear medium, but those a little larger than medium, still they fit good and look very sexy. recommend to buy i like the way it looks and feels.  it\\'s fabric is light, soft, and moves with me when i dance in zumba class.  the red and purple pants are vibrant in color, which i hope will last.  i haven\\'t washed them yet. these are thick and soft. the other reviews were right on spot about sizing. super happy. will probably buy a coue more to replace my old cotton yoga pants that are thinning. they have a true fold over top. very sick material, good for winter frosty weather! love love love this outfit! it\\'s soft and comfy and fits so perfectly. and the designs are adorable! i just ordered another with a different design! great fit, incredibly soft, material washes and dries very well! just wish it came in more colors, especially in black! love them! great! pants are very large, but once you put them on you feel like the most bad ass person in the room. after reading the reviews, i figured i\\'d order a size larger. i usually buy mediums in pajamas, because i like roomy night clothes. i don\\'t like anything that\\'s constrictive when i sleep. at any rate, i bought these in a large, and they fit perfectly. the pants are still roomy, and i absolutely love the top. it\\'s the kind of tank i could see myself bumming around in the yard with. all in all, just buy a size larger than you normally would. i was hoping for something reasonably close to the pictured model. this was so not the case. instead the sheer part comes right up to the breast, so the moment you move, you are exposed. now i just have any item that hangs in the closet that i cant wear. i was happy with the pants for the most part. i understand they\\'re not bootcut jeans or anything but it does kind of bother me how much extra space there is with the pants. if i wear them on my hips they hangdown a good handfull of fabric, kind of makes me feel like i\\'m walking around sagging my pants. but i\\'m happy with them over all and other than what was stated they fit comfortably and great. durable too i ordered these partly because my son loves sports and i thought that would make him more likely to wear them.  instead i got light blue and striped training pants.  annoying.  they could have at least mentioned you may not get the same design that\\'s pictured.<br /><br />that being said, it\\'s still a good product.  absorbent, but not like pull ups so he knows he can\\'t use them like a diaper.  so far, i\\'m optimistic that these will help us much more than pull ups have.<br /><br />also, they do run a little big (which is odd since gerber clothes usually run small).  i ordered the 3t and my son is very tall for his age, but these are pretty big.  at least i know they\\'ll last a while. cute beach, yoga, couch wear these are really fun pants. they fit me really well. the material is very thin though. this product has been a relief for me.  my son is 6 years old and still has nighttime accidents.  we thought he would do better without wearing a pullup as he would feel wet, but he\\'s such a deep sleeper that it didn\\'t wake him.  he just soaked himself and the bed and would eventually wake up screaming.  we did the whole middle-of-the-night sheet changing thing for months, but i\\'m tired!  i didn\\'t want to put him back into pullups, but i also wanted something that would absorb his urine without it reaching the sheets.  this was perfect for that.  i did read others\\' reviews and ordered a size up from his usual.  this was a very good call as the leg openings are cut quite slim.  he couldn\\'t have gone any smaller and still have kept his leg circulation.  the underpants are a bit bulkier than i thought they would be, but i guess it really has to be for maximum absorption.  my son does not mind wearing them at all and understands that he still has to try to go the potty :) fit nicely,  good quality.  a little too pricey.  i bought many items at once for christmas,  i didn\\'t realize until later that shipping was $15 love the pants ... great fit for my 4 month old who is longer than most babies at his age...fabulous buy!! ended up giving them to my daughter and they fitted her just fine... my granddaughter loves it. update: once washed on delicate and cold, one pair has a tiny bit of fading to the black and the waits seem loose. i still love these, but i don\\'t think they will last past one summer and i may sew elastic into the waist. the length could be longer. they just hit the top of my shoe and i am 5\\'7&#34;, 140lbs, ordered the large.  i love these pants. they fit perfect, no alterations needed. i wear them to the office for work. i was tired of wearing my winter dress pants and had no choice until i found these. i am 5\\'7&#34; and 140lbs, normally wear size 8 to 9 pants and the large fit perfect. they are more fitting on your thighs and rear, but not tight, then loose at the bottom. some brands are so wide they look ridiculous, not with these. i am ordering more. they work for me a little long, but alright, decent quality. more cotton-y than expected. sag after an hour of stretching. they\\'re really good quality; feels very strong. perfect length and not too tight! (i\\'m 5\\'2\\'\\' and 110 lbs) i see everyone saying it\\'s see-through, but it\\'s really not...the first day i wore, i had on bright undergarments, and no one could see anything! they allow for a lot of movement and don\\'t make me hot on a sunny day. i recommend buying these. i may have lost weight.the waist is a little loose.other then that i like the pants.i have store bought these pants before and they are comfortable.i have a question.i am 80.does that contribute to weight lose? i plan on purchasing a couple more pairs. i\\'ve had these pants for awhile now and must say i don\\'t think they wear all that well.  i bought these for walking and lounging around the house.  i wish i was one of those people motivated enough to work out all the time but i\\'m not.  i mention this because i could see the pants thinning or wearing out on me if i worked out in them all the time, but that\\'s not the case here.  they are extremely comfortable pants, but they fade and thin out pretty quickly. (about a year, give or take).  depending on the price i would buy them again, but not if i was ‚Äúinterviewing‚Äù them to be a part of my main workout attire.  there perfect for lounge around the house in your ‚Äúcomfies‚Äù!  i hope that makes sense‚Ä¶ i love the color and slack are very comfortable to wear, will buy again when need arrives.<br />i would recommend to anyone looking for a pair of nice slack. love them!!! would definitely buy again!!! i had seen the comments to order larger than you would normally order.  i ordered 2 sizes larger and they fit great!  it took a few weeks for them to ship, but they are worth the wait.  my son loves them!! this costume was generous sized and worked well for our grand march wedding song to sexy and i know it! this was what i was looking for so perfect it is so soft and nice to wear i hate tights and legings but i love these they fill so nice and so fluffly this product can be purchased .... fast .... and good quality .... i am satisfied seller................ i love this shirt. it is so soft and cuddly. it washes well and my toddler loves to wear it. love them. the drawstring is not a drawstring, however they are a comfortable fit and i will be buying more very comfortable fabric and fitting. great very nice. they fit her just right. i\\'ve bought faux-leather items before and never have they had the quality of these pants!  they are thick, well made and lined.  yes, they will be hot as expected.  yes, they are delicate.  i would not recommend doing anything too physical in them (i.e. sports) but for a night out on the town they are wonderful!      i am a fuller figured woman and they looked very good on me.  however, they do run small.  i am a size 14 and i had to order the 18 to fit properly.  just follow the measurements provided in the sizing charts.  these measurements are true.  the only small complaint i have is that the waist is a bit big (hips fit perfectly). love these jeans fits well and made well. i expected them to run a little big because once i start to wash them they are going to shrink up a little. looking to purchase more. like every other article of under the nile clothing i have bought, these pants are very soft, well made, and wash well. they look very cute and appear very comfortable. they stay on well without having tight elastic around the tummy - no tight at all but they really stay up well. fit well over bulky diapers.  great pants for little ones. they are a true 20 fit wise. would give 5 stars if the length was a little longer. i\\'m 6 ft tall. lovely pants. love fabric & fit. i love these training pants. i bought them for my daughter, because for what ever reason regular panties were just always shifting around on her and were obnoxiously thin and expensive and i feel like i am paying out the ear for a thin piece of cloth with a cheap princess decal on it. these fit snugly and comfortably and last. at first she didn\\'t want to wear them because they had no princesses on them (purposely got white so we could use them for our boys too), but after about 2 weeks her complaints ended and she has actually thanked me for &#34;getting her comfortable panties&#34;. i like that they hold &#34;leaking&#34;  and accidents in well without making a mess on my carpet. these underwear hold all the wet mess in until i can run tot to the shower and clean her up. will definitely purchase more when we need them. great pants these pants are nice!  even though they are cord\\'s, they are pretty light.  the colors are just right if you like pink.  i love mine. pants worked great for a cosplay, very cool, as in \\\\\\\\\"not hot\\\\\\\\\". and they look amazing. i would definitely get them again once i need a another. longer than expected.  if i add a strip of coordinating fabric in side seam they will fit great. love the length---impossible to find this length.  thank you.  mgeorge i wear a 32&#34; waist and i am 6\\'5&#34; and these fit perfectly size medium. great workout pants, just a little thinner than i expected. i typically wear a size 16 pants and these are a little snug. i\\'m 5\\'7&#34; and they\\'re long enough to wear with a low heel. they are groovy and i can\\'t wait to wear them when the cooler weather sets in. my grandson loves them abd received item very quickly i was looking for a good pair of rain pants and i have to say this pair have been the best for me and very durable. sweeter looking in the photo than on my daughters body. still cute though. shorter than in the picture, seems to run a size small.fabric is thin, but not see through. pills slightly, however adequate for the price. would i purchase it again?..........i think not. i love this short. my customers keep asking me to get more for them..<br />this company is very creative and their products are excellent please don\\'t review items unless you\\'ve actually purchased them.  no, these are not hakama, so the name is misleading.  in fact, the style is more like thai fisherman\\'s pants, with one leg folded over and the other straight, resulting in an interesting emphasis on the kanji.  this asymmetry is not an accident--you can find similar pants elsewhere, though rarely for as good a price.  the artistically messy writing makes it difficult to count the strokes, but i believe it says \\\\\\\\\"zen\\\\\\\\\".  the material is a soft but sturdy rough-woven cotton with a linen-look, and the seams are not serged but enclosed for an especially durable finish.  in all, i found these pants to be both seriously cool and extremely comfortable. the elastic straps broke.  not necessary to function and i plan to fix them so no big deal. classic woodland camo is superb, all the other camo look-a-like don\\'t come close to these here. i bought a medium-short because i\\'m 5\\'10\\\\\\\\\"ish, and slightly bulky so they fit on me very well. but the bad, a couple buttons were not sewn on properly, but there no problem to put back on(make them stronger). but over all good pants, i just bought another pair also, so i recommend them for anyone interested in buying them. super comfortable well made pants!! i echo a lot of the comments- i live in the mid-altantic region and i didn\\'t want long underwear that was too thick and would be too warm to wear all day in the office.  these are absolutely perfect and sexy. and they have a piece of fabric that push the &#34;package&#34; up to make your budge bigger. nice bonus...i would buy more pairs next winter for sure! we love these pjs! they are so soft and so light. we\\'ll definitely be ordering more! i love my juicy sweatpants. they\\'re very comfy and you can wear them while lounging around the dorm or to class. they only problem i have is they tend to lose their elasticity fairly quickly. after only a few wearings, mine were barely formfitting. they became more wide-legged around the upper-thigh area. also i am 5\\'6&quot; and after washing they shrunk about an inch which didn\\'t have much of an effect but if you\\'re taller you might want to look elsewhere. and even if you\\'re petite go with the regular sizes instead of the petite because of this problem. other than that, they\\'re still well worth the money and are better than a lot of the other sweats on the market. true to color,like in the photo! not too thick! i love\\'em is exactly like the picture, beautiful color and quality, i love it.  100% recommended.  materials are very well supported.  excellent!!! i like that it easy to get into. it\\'s light and soft perfect for summer. i am 5\\'10\\'\\' and have a 36 inseam at least, these were definitely long enough they touch the floor, they fit perfect and the feel great, the material is not too thin either so i can wear them in public which is what i bought them for in the first place!!! will definitely buy more! :) regular long johns are so thick and bulky and so masculine.  these are so soft and comfortable and feminine and make me feel nice and toasty warm in the winter. i bought these as a christmas gift for my bf and he loves them. the fit was perfect, not tight...very light & comfy. cute and great fit. a w e s o m e jogger.. fits perfectttt super comfyyyy.. i order 1 and as soon as i try it i bought another jogger !! everybody ask where i got them comfortable and stylish, they fit true to size and are nice and long!! great material, very soft with lots of stretch. i would definitely recommend. absolutely love cool and comfy. took forever to get here, but still glad i got them. love them they fit perfect. just the right size and the medium weight material is perfect for everday wear nice fit very well these pants are very soft and fit well.  i like the available colors.  they are great since my daughter cannot seem to keep socks on her feet and it is getting cold. i was not disappointed .  they are classy and fit wonderfully. very good . these are great and comfy too. my husband loves them thank you! these are nice, just a tiny bit loose on the waist for me but i still kept them. fit fine, and overall pretty comfy for working out. this is worth the extra money! first of all, the color is beautiful. secondly, it is so soft!! the blanket is slightly bigger than a lot of baby blankets and it\\'s stretchiness gives you a little more slack, which makes it nice for swaddling.  also, the material is wonderful and a lot more versatile than the flannel or muslin blankets. i highly recommend it! fits like a glove, very comfortable. i`ve been using it for a week only, but it seems to be a great purchase. great price.. great for running....great product i used these pants for a fitness event for the 4th of july (with a rex kwon do opening skit). it was fun but moisture from sweat caused these cotton baggies to get a bit heavy. strong elastic in the waist prevented any \\'costume malfunctions\\' so nothing to worry about there unless you buy them bigger than your waist can hold up. as far as the rex kwon do skit, these are the best i could find (you think anyone wants a roundhouse kick to the face when i\\'m wearing these bad boys? forget about it!).<br /><br />sizing is normal but they are super baggy. if you\\'re not used to baggy pants, they may feel big, but the length and the elastic gathers at the bottom of the pant legs are a better judge for proper fit. although i normally wear 34/34, i ordered a large/long expecting it to be too big - which it is...  i washed it  in very hot water followed by a hot dryer twice, thinking it would shrink (which is why i ordered it too large) but if it did, i couldn\\'t tell...  that said, i can live with the length and the tabs on the waist took up the extra 2&#34; that i didn\\'t need (and the pants didn\\'t look &#34;bunched up&#34;)...  i then sprayed them with a waterproofing spray (orange cap) and let \\'em dry out...  haven\\'t worn them in the field yet but expect they\\'ll perform like the parachute cargo pants i purchased at the same time (see my review on them)... i am in love with these pants they are very comfy and being 5\\'8&#34; i am always afraid pants are going to be to short but these were perfect in length! i am hoping they will get more colors in so that i can order more. the pajama pants are stretchy, which makes them comfortable. the size fit as i expected. i like them so much i hate to take them off and i am going to buy more. i have not washed them yet. i also bought the men\\'s  gryffindor crestor tee and i think they look cute together. it is also comfy. by the way i am a women, but both fit fine. the designs are whimsical and fun. i found similar p.j.s elsewhere online, but they were about double the cost. i got them yesterday and i worn them all they long and they were great, sooooo confortable, they are a little hot on the inside but if you wear them on a cold day they would be perfect. they look nice and noboby noticed they were not real jeans. i wish they had other colors to buy more. forget about unconfortable and tight jeans. item exactly as pictured and promise very lightweight my son loves them i\\'ve had these for a while now and they have held up during quite a few leg training days in the gym. no rips or tears yet!  they are comfortable and the fit is great. i have gotten many compliments on the style of these leggings. good quality, just small. love! love! if you are slender and tall and like yoga pants, these r the pants for u! they do fit snug‚Ä¶‚Ä¶buy a size up from what you usually are fits  real good lenth also  ill recomend wallflower to all  loved them there are two things i regret about this purchase: that i can\\'t afford to buy a dozen of them, and living in them 24/7 is not possible.  although i would not normally pay so much for \\\\\\\\\"workout\\\\\\\\\" clothes, i made an exception for these because it is so difficult to find yoga pants in petite sizes.  i\\'m so glad i made that exception.  they are so comfortable and fit perfectly. i just hope i don\\'t wear them out too quickly since now i want to put them on everyday.  i guess only time will tell. very cute!! love these pants! they are beautiful looking and so comfortable. they fit great! i am only 5\\'4\\\\\\\\\" so i just cuff the waist once or twice and they are perfect! they did come with a stain on the bottom of the legs and it freaked me out because they are supposed to be new. but just in case you buy one and this also happens to you, the people let me know that it is just something that was on the pants from the making process. they assured me it would come right out with washing them or ironing it. well i washed them and it did, it came right out!! i can\\'t wait to wear these pants and order more!! very nice cotton ! love the small back pocket! very cute they look so good. fit me like a glove. it\\'s alittle long for me but still good. every detail looks so nice. the tights them self look good in pictures. will be purchasing again in the future !!! so excited they came in with my great wave leggings too !!! flight suit looks great and has great features.  when worn pants and dri fire combat shirt only it is great in hot weather.  the only con to this purchase is that the top runs big.  i would definitely recommend this to any aviator. wonderful pair of pants.<br />size was great and the material is very comfortable.<br />good price too! we would order again.<br />package was rec\\'d timely.<br />thank you! love them like the feel & fit.  highly recommended for the fall and/or rainy days. i love this company. their cloths are reasonably priced & beautifully made. customer service couldn\\'t be better.<br />the sizes fluctuate but measurements are provided & advice is freely given. i buy here rather than ef. the grandson wanted these for christmas.  teenagers????  i got them in time but was sent the wrong size, so when i got ahold of the company, the size was all sold out.  they offered me the correct size in a better quality, no extra charge and got them here in time.  couldn\\'t ask for a happier grandson. super comfy....i am totally able to do a round house kick with these bad boys!!!! i want these!!!!!! material seems great for the price but they definitely seem big.....its okay with me though i think they\\'ll be comfy for the baby :) i bought the 0-3 month and they will probably fit my baby up until 6-9 months. got black. comfy fit product fit great, was not to shinny as they look on the picture and i loved wearing them.  would recommend.  i wear a 12 and ordered a large and fit me perfect. i was so pleasantly surprised when i received this hat and a second in another color.  i bought them for my 1 year old.  they fit perfectly and are maybe just a little big (i bought size 12-24 mo).  they were so so so soft....the next day i tried to find out if kicky pants had any adult hats. although, being 5\\'5 does not really give a great example since i would have to measure my inseam to give you a correct review.  but i love these pants - so comfortable. runs smaller in tge waist than other wallflower pants i have purchased i bought a small for my daughter who is about a size 2-3 and they fit well. she loves them. the fabric is nice quality with a bit of a sheen to it. i ordered a second pair for her for school and if i am in need of jeggings for her in the future i will check here first! great summer pants! will be wearing a lot this summer. just right! great fit, fast dry, perfect for yoga amazing<br />soft style jegging fit good very soft material! the best! softest! beautiful. these pants fit really well everywhere but the waist line, but they stay up. they are very comfy and soft. i am a tall large framed african american woman and was very nervous about the pants fitting especially in the rear area.  the material on these pants allowed room for different figure type adjustments and shaped to my figure just like the picture!!! whether you are curvy or skinny these pants will fit!!!  i will be ordering more of these!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! great pants! very figure friendly! i love these pants.<br /><br />they are well made of quality materials and last a long time.<br /><br />sizing was accurate and when they fade after about six months they start to look and feel even better. i like these. they fit well and are a soft material. i would buy more. same as new 062 skin tight compression base layer camo running shirt review.  super! bought several.  no bulk, just warmth! these are fantistic great color great fix i order a medium  i wear a medium they look like jeans but very smooth like dress pants  they\\'re of  a spandex item thank god other wise i might not be writing this review they arrived within days this is good  thank you it\\'s wonderful something has gone right after much dissapiontment i tried potty training my 22-month old with regular underwear, but after one day, i saw that every time he wet his pants it ran onto the floor and in between the tiny cracks in our hardwood floors. ick! after trying to clean between the floorboards twice, i gave up and immediately ordered these training pants, and re-started potty training once they arrived. they did the trick. when my son had an accident, the training pants and his clothes got wet, making him realize what happened, but his shoes and the floors were dry. the clean-up was much easier. as he improved, he would wet the training pants just a bit, realize he was about to have an accident, and stop and go do the rest on the toilet. the training pants are just absorbent enough to keep these mini-accidents off his clothes. so all i had to change were the training pants--his clothes were dry! now he wears them as regular underwear; they are super soft, and he loves them. my one recommendation is that you buy more than one package. three pairs are not enough to make it through the day when you are first starting, particularly with boys. i got by with two packages by doing a load of wash every day. it\\'s not a waste, since they can wear them as regular underwear once they get the hang of things. thanks to these training pants, my son is not yet two, and is already potty trained! (and my floors are no longer a bio-hazard.) i highly recommend this item in several colors and sizes. it is very soft, easy to wash, extendable (babies grow fast!), and the patterns very cute. i really love this outfit. it is a little sheer which is why i only gave it 4 stars. this us the second jumper i\\'ve purchased and i am completely satisfied. there\\'s a reason when you think \\\\\\\\\"tactical pants,\\\\\\\\\" 5.11 immediately comes to mind.  these are the gold standard for these types of pants and though they are often imitated, they are never equalled (sorry for the cliche, but it\\'s true).    i\\'m a firearms instructor who wears these every day and have no complaints whatsoever about the quality, the utility, and the comfort of these pants.  they are heavy and might be just a little bit warm on a hot day (think carhartt dungarees for a close comparison), but beyond that, they\\'re as close to perfect as you can get.    seriously, i\\'m not the gushing type who commonly gives 5 star reviews, but these things are worth it.    the price that papashoe is charging for these is outrageous though.  look around (you won\\'t have to look very hard or long) and you\\'ll find them for 30 dollars cheaper. i have so many pairs...i can\\'t stop ordering! i am 5\\'8 and 155-160 the xl fits great. i have them in malibu blue, navy blue black and mahogany brown. such cute pants. think thick leggings with seams and pockets like jeans. great to dress up or down. i just had a baby too so this is a perfect stretchy solution to be stylish and comfy while shedding the pounds. super long too so they have that stylish scrunch at the bottom as shown in the picture. i had to exchange my first pair and they replaced them super fast! customer service is excellent, shipping is fast, pants are super cute! im so happy with my purchases these are great looking and fitting pants, tends to run a little bigger for size. awesome this is sue a 67 year old artist. i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; sz. small in pants and these fit great. i love them! they are my style and i now have 3 fabulous pairs of ellazhu pants. my sone just loves the pants. now these are all he wants to wear. going to stock up for next school year!! beyond adorable! so soft and cozy. we love kickee pants for their quality and comfort they provide our daughter! these are a great option for long babies that have sizing issues with footed sleepers.  i ordered these in 3-6 months size when my daughter was 2 months old.  the material is very nice and the pants still look brand new after many washings (no fading, shrinking or pilling).  she\\'s now 4.5 months old, 18lbs2oz and 26&#34; long and these have just gotten to the point of being a tad small.<br />these footed pants are wayyyy more convenient than hunting down and/or fighting with socks all day.  i was hesitant at first because they\\'re pricier than most, but they\\'re definitely worth the money in style and quality.<br />highly recommend. nice quality for the price. i bought these shorts to wear under skirts and they work very nicely. exactly what i wanted. love them but buy a large if u have long legs or they will be too short other than that smoking !!!! if you are like me, and you kinda just wash everything on the same temp/dryer settings, don\\'t with these!<br />other colors seem fine with it, but these get pilled up after one wash as if used for years.<br /><br />i deducted one star even though its kind of my own fault, because i was disappointed how much it actually affected them. they got pilled enough that i can\\'t wear them anywhere but home. cozy i used to wear this kind of jeans all the time and i have had a hard time finding them.  i love these jeans.  they are very comfortable and not super heavy.  if you are a rave kid these are for you. i wore these pants on a skiing expedition in montana a couple of months ago.  they\\'re quite comfortable, and the fleece lining is incredibly warm.  i could see how they may get a little chilly if you\\'re not moving around much, but as long as you stay somewhat active, they\\'re just right! first time wearing this kind of pant and i love them and the look is just what i expected. nice my 11 year old son is in love with this belt :-) and wants to wear it everyday. guess catbug is the new craze. i love this style of pant. comfortable material as well. i work with children ages 0-10 every day.  wearing these pants it allows me to be comfortable while playing with the children and have a professional look. my toddler loves these &#34;big boy undies&#34; and so do i. they were absorbant enough to protect his pants from little accidents. i wish they had an elastic band around the top to help hold them up but other than that i would definately buy again if needed. my 14 year old daughter loves them she got a medium for juniors . the material is great . the print is also . everything was as expected . nice fit and feel these were great to wear in the hospital after our son was born.  very comfortable and soft and not knowing what to expect afterwards it was great that they were adjustable in the waist. love it !! it fit very well i will be ordering a lot more stuff from them i got my i order two week before i thout i would get it pretty! bought these for my son for his birthday. good fit not restrictive to sleep in. perfect for any gamer who would appreciate the practicality perfect for our show. fit great. good quality love love love these!! they do pill very easily but i just wear them around the house so not a big deal. i was pretty happy with these scrubs.  they were bigger than i had thought, but not too big.  the color was stunning and they were very reasonable. they fit good, just a little tight in the crouch area, but i love them should hold better than many other smaller buttons this is so cute i love these yoga pants. i am 5\\'1&#34;<br />and they fit me nicely. they were a tiny bit long but much better than most pants which are always too long for me. it\\'s a really cute skirt. it came from seoul, so the s+h was expensive. but it arrived by fedex very fast. the only little issue is the waist band is wide, but the elastic inside  keeps folding over. i gave up trying to straighten it out.i would recommend this product i bought these to help potty train my grand daughter, they are just like i used for my own children. great quality, great product! i bought my best friend the slytherin bottoms and got myself the ravenclaw.  they are so comfortable!  we both love them! just beware that the legs are pretty long so be careful about wearing them outside cause they might drag on the ground.  i\\'m pretty tall female and it does for me. and for my friend who\\'s short. this product really does range from x-small - x-large. only downside is how long they are, personally i am 5\\'10&#34; and they fit me perfect for the leg length, but the waist goes up past mid-stomach. material is soft cloth. material is a lot thinner than expected. but fits. just not as warm as i thought it would be. these bdu pants are awesome! they fit just right and are very well made. they are so darn comfortable! i like them a lot. now i have matching shirt and pants. they have nice pockets, length ties, and waist adjustments as well.<br /><br />i recommend these to anyone who wants comfort and practicality. these are very nice! now just how much can i say about pants i like them a little tight in the legs but over all good a little tight around the waist-not the loose fit  required when wearing over other pants pants were great a little long and really baggy but that is what i wanted.  i am enjoying them well this is amazing !!! i thought i would have to throw out so many jeans that fit everywhere except the waist, this did the job easily to expand the waistline for a comfortable fit!! i would recommend when i ordered these it was with the hope that they would perform as well as the  onsies that i bought for my newborn ten months ago that are still going strong. so far these have survived two washes well with the colours still bright and vibrant and the material remaining soft and with no shrinkage. i bought the 24-months for my 10 month old who is very long and cannot begin to fit in clothes for his age group. they fit perfectly giving him space to grow, while being soft and comfortable. the material is fairly durable without being heavy, perfect for pyjamas. these are a great buy and i plan to buy more, definitely can\\'t go wrong. unusually cute! cute and comfortable, cold or warm, running or lounging, they just work! awesome love them good quality and price. hard to get a 29 inch lenght. lovem these particular ones are the best ones i got. they didn\\'t rip. i\\'m 5.6 and was 9 months preg with twins wearing them at about 150lbs. they are very high waisted. super comfy fit well very comfy. fits perfectly and love that they have velcro to adjust the length of the pants. loved it! perfect gift! my friend loved them and they were cute as could be! i may order myself a pair! i really like it, it\\'s very cute!! great custom for our school party the kids will love it, thanks you cute pants! got some good comments on them. arrived before due date i love them! these pants are soo comfortable. perfect thank i have been looking for a cute pair of pants that are comfy and have pockets that i love.. these met my expectations and more. these are adorable little boy (or for a girl, too) leggings. i use these as pajamas on cool nights, &#34;around the house&#34; clothing, or also as a second layer on our cold, winter days. the quality of these has always amazed me. i\\'ve been purchasing these since my toddler was a baby. unfortunately, we\\'ve reached the largest size (equivalent to a 3t) and aren\\'t able to buy them anymore! even when my little one was crawling, these held up so nicely! there was no wearing down in the knee area, which i thought was amazing! i love that these are a thick knit and definitely keep little legs warm. it is extremely difficult finding little boy leggings like this, and i am so happy that i have been able to purchase these from amazon for three years! great purchase that will last you a long time! and, of course, the designs on the butt are adorable!!! love it it\\'s very comfortable to workout in the gym very soft and comfortable delivered promptly. i loved the style and fit, except for all fake pockets. wish it had two pockets. extremely durable sweatpants, the fit is great. i\\'m 5\\'11&#34; 180 and the size mediums fit me perfectly. absolutely no complaints. my friend really liked these leggings so i decided to get it for her birthday so i\\'m soo excited to see her expression when she gets this :3. great pants for the price. they do shrink a size from washing them so i did order them 1 size larger then what i normally wear. search around on the web i got mine at bdu.com for 29.99 each i wouldn\\'t pay more then 35 for them. the pocket set-up works out great for me total of 4 cargo pockets,(one behind the velcro cargo is a nice touch) cell pocket on left front fits droid with hard case,(my 5.11\\'s i would have to take the case off and my droid still be on the tight side) rear pockets with flap and velcro, and deep front pockets with a coin pocket on right side. only thing that would make this a 5 star product would be a gusted crotch like the 5.11\\'s have, but for the price point it\\'s a great pant for the price. i would definitely recommend and buy more for 30-35 dollars. great my son was pleased as it was a gift for him :) loved these training pants for my granddaughter.  they have the double thickness in the center to help control wetness when accidents occurs.  they are just what i was looking for. no problems with this item. it was exactly what my son was looking for. the pants look great and are easily washed and back on in 1/2 hour. material is durable, tough. the product got shipped fast, its a great fit to dance in or to just wear during any everyday activity...i loved it... these hold up well and are comfortable. fantastic pants!!!! shipped immediately and nice price...i got them for my teenage daughter and they fit perfectly! she is a happy camper. i have never owned yoga pants before, but after my friends twisting my arm i finally bought a pair and oh. my. god. i thought i was in heaven. i have never worn a more comfortable pair of pants in my life and honestly if i had the money i would buy 10 pairs and wear nothing else. the color of these was perfect - a nice dark brown.  the fabric was very soft.  i can\\'t speak toward the fit - as the baby hasn\\'t arrived yet - but can\\'t wait to try it out! the seller is incredible!!!!not only that order your size it will fit i ordered too big i ordered a 13 and i can fit in differnt sizes but usually an 11 or 13 would fit so i suggest getting exactly what fits you to be safe but the seller was so wonderful i am getting a new one in a smaller size today. thank you so much. its worth every penny nice fit look its beautiful! if you are wide or want a pair you can finally fit into here they are they strech perfect! i just absolutely luv cheetah print here kitty kitty meow meow lol ordered these for my husband who works in a kitchen.  they were a little larger than expected, but not too big to drag.  he finds them comfortable and is pleased with them.  they\\'ve held up as his current favorite work pants for the last few months. good.... kicky pants brand are the greatest especially for warm climates. wife likes the tights<br />a little  small but wearable<br />nice look and comfortable<br />good design - loves the  usa theme they fit great! arrived earlier than expected. love \\'em! i picked these up for track training for 200 meters. i had hopes that these pants would be designed with runners in mind and they clearly have been. very comfortable, they don\\'t flap around, and they handle very well. definite world class design! love these leggings/pants! they are so cute and fit amazingly well! my only word to the wise is that the band that goes partway across your stomach is very tight. i am a petite girl, 5\\'2\\'\\' and wear a jean size of 0-2 and it\\'s almost a little too tight on the stomach area for me (and i don\\'t have a large tummy area) but that being said, a medium would be too large in the legs and in terms of length.<br /><br />other than that, these are so sexy and modelesque. also if anyone is worried about the lack of &#34;butt pockets&#34; don\\'t be. they didn\\'t make my rear end look too large and the seams are structured just so as to not accentuate in an unflattering way. also i know i was worried about the zippers being too brightly gold and potentially looking cheesy, but they look great! the leggings in general look expensive and i\\'ve gotten tons of compliments on them and i only wore them for 1 day so far! not the greatest quality leggings but for the price they are great. i belly dance and find the harem pants extremely comfortable and they fit perfectly.  you can dress them up or down.  every harem girl should have them. the fit was excellent and i went out and ran a 5k on the potomac river. felt really warm and insulated the whole time. propper is the current military contractor/supplier for us military uniforms.  these pants fit extremely well, are made of high quality materials, and have all the bells and whistles you would expect from a mil-spec item.  i am ordering a few more sets for the family. i am obsessed with these! love, love the look!  a black top, cardigan and cute scarf with tall boots. thank god i read the reviews to know that i needed to order an xl. i am usually a medium in things. these run extremely small if you order your normal size. i am 5\\'5, 138lbs and the xl is perfect. the material is so soft....kinda like pajamas! bought both white and beige in these pants.  showed my cellulite for a short time as was clingy, but as i sat and moved around they loosened up very quickly.  nicely made and the fabric is not too thin.  like the stitched front creases as they give definition and style.  will buy again. great price, fast shipping, item as described, will buy from again. these fleece pants are so nice and soft!  i\\'m 5\\'3\\\\\\\\\" tall about 104 pounds and the size small was perfect all the way around.  not too long-just right! fit great except for the length. i knew they would be long when i bought them. it\\'s difficult to find a shorter length in yoga pants. ( i\\'m 5 feet tall) my guy wears a 10...i ordered a 12 based on other reviews. still a bit tight at the hips. definitely, order 2 sizes bigger. other than that, the pants are great. thick material that looks like it can stand up to quite a bit of warfare. long enough for my 6\\'4 boyfriend. good quality and look great. nice just smells like it was from someones basement i really like this sleeveless pant romper.  i purchased this romper in black and blue, but because the bust area is too small, i will have to return. the lower portion of the romper fit well. the style is cute, the fabric is nice for day and/or evening wear with the right accessories. arrived on time, nice fitting and looking really comfortable they are  a little loose in the waist, but won\\'t slide off. although, they can be pulled down very easily, so watch out for toddlers! the pattern is adorable and they are so soft and comfortable. also, they are lightweight and breathable, so i can even wear them on hot days. they have faded after a couple washes, and are really polly, however, it\\'s not noticeable unless you\\'re sitting right next to someone. i don\\'t remember what the care instructions said, but i wash them in cold water on the delicate cycle, and i didn\\'t hang them to dry the first two times, and i think that might be why they are pilling. does anyone have any suggestions so they don\\'t fade and pull so much? love these pants! perfect. great quality my gf loves them too. want more sci-fi ones!! bien i love, no... adore these pants.  i am a petite female, who has no interest in hip hugging, low waist, tight leg, bell bottomed pants, which seem to be all the rage.  seems like my choices have been the aforementioned, which i abhor, or mom jeans, which i may abhor more.  enter molecule.  they\\'ll make sure to verify you understand the pant size you\\'ve chosen, but they literally fit.  no size 0 for j crew, then 2 for gap and 4 for levi\\'s, etc...  these are true to my actual size!  i\\'m about 5\\'3&#34; and can pull off a 25&#34;-27&#34; waist.  these are so perfect, i went to molecule and ordered another pair, along with two pairs of shorts.<br /><br />the pants, themselves, are very well made.  heavy with solid stitching, the cargos are very durable. love this pajama set!! should have ordered more. the material feels like nylon on the outside.  the pants are lined, and run a little big, problably because unisex.  i do however like the fact that food does not stick to the pants.  wash up nicely. perfect fit had order the large it\\'s super comfy i\\'m 5\\'7 and illove that it doesn\\'t stop before my ankles it is just like the picture they\\'re stretchy and pretty durable. it\\'s a pretty exciting look... especially for dancing... at first i was kinda scared because i wanted a pair like this in men\\'s sizes except i couldn\\'t find any. but the product i got is definitely unisex i think. still playing with it...lov it! these fit really nice. the color is not white though, it\\'s more like a grey. the small pearl and silver accents look delicate. these were just a little large for grandson, but he\\'s growing daily so didn\\'t send back. won\\'t be long before he\\'s wearing them and then probably won\\'t be able to get the off of him. his daddy was in the air force so he already loves camo. runs small. i would consider buying the next size up! these are my new favorite pants. i\\'m going to order every style they\\'re available in. i love the fit and this was very comfortable. i will be ordering again these are so warm and cute and comfortable.  they fit very flatteringly.  you must buy these you can dress them up and wear them with nice boots when its cold and still look chic. i am amazed at how well these fit. i\\'m normally very wary of one size clothing because it never fails to be too big for me- but these are extremely flexible from person to person; i could tell the moment i took them out of the package. i\\'m 5 feet tall with 25inch waist and my main concern was the legs being too long, but nope! the waist band fits snugly wherever you want it, high or low. the colors are beautiful. the material is a nice sheer material. the pockets feel great. it\\'s all great. these pants will make me feel so pretty on warm days to come (: great job! awesome these are the only ones that fit well my tall and lean daughter. i like that they are not waterproof because they let her skin breath. i tried another popular and cheaper brand and was not happy with the fit nor the quality. i ordered a l because i wanted them to be a little looser.. they are about 8 inch too long!! i am going to have to cut and hem them if you love linen like i do buy from this company.if you love eileene fisher like i do you love this company.<br />excellent quality linen. i purchase the oak and white in large and they fit perfect . i wear size 14 5 \\'7 in. tall<br />i live in sunny california i want almost everything this company sells,they exceed my expectations super comfortable and can be casual or dressy. i\\'m short, 5\\', so would like them a little shorter these are great pants with a great fit. i bought the khaki pants first and then came back to buy the olive and string ones. they\\'ve all now been through the wash a couple of times and you probably will want to use a warm iron to maintain the crease and get a cleaner look to them but they aren\\'t wrinkled by any means. i am always concerned about black pants fading and otherwise not washing well. after seeing how the other three pants hold up, i will definitely get the black version when i need them. bought for daughter for school. she is very please very the style. great pants love them ,only problem i have maybe i should of got smaller size i keep pulling them up ,very comfortable a+++++++++++. first:great monokini,<br />2: wonderful quality,<br />3: super fast shipping<br />4:fits perfectly ( for skinny girls with c-d sizes breast -need size m) i\\'m 5\\'9 high, 36c cup. usually buy s size, but this ordered m size.<br />5: u will be unique at the pool party or in the resort ...<br />6: exactly like on this picture i ordered these pants as a gift for my dad and they are very nice quality. i would order them again. they were nice, well made . but i had to return them. to long . sleeping in these,you feel comfortable and well rested in the waking hours,so much you dont feel like working. love it! i work in a tire shop for a living and these pants hold up extremely well. i wear mostly the black ones and they conseal most of my dirt grime and break dust i get on me on a daily basis. they are comfortable and fit extremely well. i would definitely recommend them. my daughter wears these for dancing on her team and loves them for hip hop. she said they stretch well and fit well. i can\\'t wear these pants to the gym too often because all the girls come and talk to me and i lose my pump :( when ordering a pair of pants for the winter i wasn\\'t sure about these at first but after purchase was incredibly satisfied. very warm and comfortable! after testing i would say work well to keep you warm in well below 0 degrees fahrenheit. flexible and great for the outdoors. arrived in time for christmas and my son loved them. prefect size and made well. i am sure to see him in them many of weekends. nice they were a hit! you would be a fool not to buy this product to cut water weight. you would also be a fool to purchase this product to reduce cellulite. i love these they are so comfortable and cute. the fit is great as well. i would buy again. [[asin:b000e1vfxg kids cargo pants olive drab cargos]]great product, very happy with quality-adjustable waistband-(which is great for thinner kids, as my grandson)quick shipping daughter liked them. said they fit good and were comfy. got these for hubby and he loves them i will deffinaetly be ordering more in the future maybe in some blue i\\'m 40-something, 5\\'7\\\\\\\\\", 145/150 lbs and usually wear a us size 10 pant (or somewhere between a med/large).<br /><br />i ordered the navy, size medium.<br /><br />the color is absolutely gorgeous! i\\'m not a big fan of \\\\\\\\\"navy\\\\\\\\\", but with the mineral wash, this particular \\\\\\\\\"navy\\\\\\\\\" color is beautiful.<br /><br />size medium fits very snug. it\\'s not too snug for comfort, but i\\'d call these \\\\\\\\\"leggings\\\\\\\\\" instead \\\\\\\\\"pants\\\\\\\\\". i will definitely have to wear a long tunic top.<br /><br />the length is absolutely perfect for my 5\\'7\\\\\\\\\" frame. the inseam, while worn (stretched as leggings do), fits like a 31.5\\\\\\\\\" which i love. and the bootcut is just right. it isn\\'t too flared, but not straight legged either.<br /><br />the fabric is super soft! i\\'m talking pajama soft! i think i\\'m going to live in these!!<br /><br />i ordered a size large in every color available. i will write another review based on that size when i receive them. i hope they fit well. if not, i\\'ll exchange them for mediums. if i could afford it, i\\'d buy multiple sizes in each color. they\\'re that perfect!<br /><br />update:<br /><br />the large is almost same size as the medium, which is ok since they both fit like leggings and are so comfy.<br /><br />customer service is absolutely wonderful! one color i ordered was out of stock. i was contacted immediately and offered another color (brown, not listed, but gorgeous) and i received my orders lightening fast:) so far, i have the navy, brown and green. i love them all!<br /><br />i wore these in new orleans (97 degrees and disgusting humidity) after a 2 hour commute. these leggings remained super comfy all day and evening. the light weight fabric was cooler than my linen summer pants. they also maintained their shape with no \\\\\\\\\"elephant knees\\\\\\\\\", even after 12 hours of hard wearing.<br /><br />these are my new summer wardrobe! i love them!! super great pants for lounging around the house, they look great and feel great. i bought these as a gift for my fiance around the holidays.<br /><br />all her yoga pants were black so i got these for her because she loves purple and i thought she would enjoy a pair that was other than black.<br /><br />these quickly became her favorite pair, she says they are thick and comfy. she is rather short 5\\'2&#34; and had to cut the legs off a fair amount.<br /><br />overall these are of nice quality. the shadowline panty line has been a excellent underwear for many years and still continues today. my wife loves the feel and fit of this style. also, as a man, i must say this style also works for me. thanks for the great styles and super service from amazon and its vendors. the training pants and nice and thick.  they contain an accident but still allow the child to feel the moisture.  they are pretty true to size but are very long. i love these pants! this unique yoga pant is flattering and comfy. i continue to get compliments on the beautifully embroidered lotus (which the photo doesn\\'t do justice). these pants have quickly moved to the top as my favorite pair! after reading the reviews - i figured i give it a try. wow!! just like a previous review , i thought how is this going to fit me? it looked so small in the packaging and really rough to the tough. once i put them on it was absolutely perfect and the roughness/stiffness lessened after washing them.  they are worth the money - i am 5\\'2&#34; and 125 love\\'s my pants i love this pants ! they fit just fine, and since i bought the 6-9 months size in blue and dark solid colors , i have been doing a lot of  body combinations,  very fashionable and washing machine friendly !...now my baby is 9 months and still use them, and i think he will for many more months because of their fashion style.. loose and comfortable.....good price also..!! loved just the item i needed.  as an older woman with physical \\'malappropriation\\' of body tissues, i was in need of something like a girdle but not a girdle.  this white hot pants did the job. as an undergarment, it provided the slimming and seamless effects and comfort.  i bought just one to try it out and i will buy more because it enhances my feelings of looking and feeling good when at home and out in the public arena. i wasn\\'t sure how they would fit but they fit very nicely .. no complaints here.. i have bought two pairs of these pants and plan on buying a third one.  they are so soft, stretchy - probably the most comfortable pants in the world. i get compliments on them all the time - people love how relaxed they look.<br /><br />i am an art model so these are the perfect pants to wear before gigs because they create no underwear lines what so ever.<br /><br />highly recommend to anyone who is looking for super comfortable pants for whatever the occasion maybe - perfect for traveling. also good for those loosing / gaining weight, since they are stretchy, one size fits many weight sizes.  enjoy! i\\'ve been using these since my little one was a few months old. i find them especially helpful when it\\'s cold cause i can flip the front down and let him potty with his pants still on (i use crotchless pants with these on top). they\\'re so easy to open and close even while he\\'s sitting or standing. a life saver when baby gets mobile and doesn\\'t wanna spend so much time with the on and offs of pottying. i will say they aren\\'t meant for super soaking or blow out or leaky poops though. depending on how well you\\'re doing at ec, it might not matter cause you\\'ll catch those in the potty anyway. i fold in an extra cloth diaper cause even his one pee goes around these since they\\'re meant to be thin and trim. they sell specific inserts for this but i\\'ve never tried them. overall, great product that i always recommend. very beautiful. good quality. i just received my pair a few weeks ago, and i must say i love them! the color is so pretty and the waist is awesome! i\\'m pretty tall, so i was a little worried about the length, but they fit perfectly! i wear them all the time because they are so comfortable! definite thumbs up! i actually got these as a joke. i thought they\\'d be silly and not look right but i\\'ve always wanted to see what they were like. surprise surprise....i love them! they\\'re so comfy and look like jeans from a distance. my brother even thought they were cool and he hates leggings/jeggings! my.daughter is upset bc she wants some too so if you make them in size 4t/5t i\\'ll def buy some! love these pants...shipping was extremely fast! great seller! thanks! then get these all-encompassing tights, sure to please every waffling got fan, while also remaining neutral enough to match practically everything you own. i get complimented by at least one psych--i mean game of thrones fan every time i put these on. worth every cent, the additional pockets was very useful n practical. i\\'ve bought 3 of these pants. so, it\\'s obvious they are good value for money. cheers! these are just perfect!  very soft, and look to be great quality. can\\'t wait to get these on my little girl, when she arrives! i really like these, theyre great fat pants! theyre nice and comfortable, not tight around the waist. theyre a bit low around the waist and im afraid they give me plumbers butt but theyre fine as long as i wear a long shirt i love these pants.  they are a little hot, but work okay indoors.  the pink top folds over my tummy and makes it look slimmer.  the material is so soft and no bunching up around my swollen knees.  great product, thanks. these tights were purchased for my daughter. they are very cute and stylish. the fabric is of good quality and very comfortable. i would definitely recommend. great pants for the price. they\\'re on the thin side and run a lil big. they\\'re great for the gym pretty lounging around. just don\\'t wear them outside on a bitter cold day! i intentionally ordered these a little small. i\\'m starting to finally see results on my fitness routine and am about to need to go down a size.<br />that being said they are still a perfect length (i\\'m 5\\'6\\\\\\\\\") and so comfortable! the fold-down band covers my back in any yoga pose and, even though it\\'s a little small on my thighs, it doesn\\'t give me a muffin top! fits me great. i\\'m just shy of 6ft, and 140 very fit. perfect length, good coverage over the bum. of course, my bum is small, so do the math... :-) -ag awesome pants, great for dancing or any physical activity all season round, they are a little bigger than expected so you might wanna go 1 size down great camo.  arrives sooner than expected with cat5 commerce company. matches my rap4 tact vest (woodland digi) perfectly. these jeans are awesome! beware, they do fit a little snug in the bum/thighs. pre-pregnancy i\\'m a size 6 and 140lbs with muscular legs and at 5 months pregnant i just fit the medium. they are about a 32\\\\\\\\\" length. real pockets and a zipper and feel like real jeans. i happened upon my zubaz at the mall in (19)95, and automatically i was overcome by a spiritual, animal connection. my soul ached and cried: i am just a man, trapped in my faded denim jeans. my animal spirit was calling me, and i knew at that moment that, for to truly be at one with nature, i must wear purple zebra print pants.    when i got some, i ran into the woods with only my zubaz and armed with a pocket knife. in solitude i sat in the woods, living and thinking like the animal, when i happened upon a wolf. there i was, both of us staring into each others eyes. we knew. we felt. we were.    during my meditations, i started to itch. was it poison oak? ants? it was cat scratch fever. it was the telepathic oneness with ted nugent. i imagined nugent. i saw him running with the buffalo, in neon green zubaz, free. he pulled out a knife, much like my own, and slit the wild beast throat. he then looked in my minds eye, and nodded to me, and disappeared  in pure white light.    thank you zubaz, for the spiritual awakening. these fit really well through the butt and thighs; i\\'m a curvy girl and have a hard time finding pants that fit, especially around the legs and thighs. bought a size 9 and they fit perfectly, not too tight in the bottom region and not too loose in the waist. i bought these for work and for the price they were a good buy, look very professional. love the cut, stylish shape and easy wear on these. i would live in them if i could. my black one was first then i bought the royal (denim) blue. the dye on the blue one gets on everything in the wash even on the third wash it\\'s still an issue. other than this i love these and will buy more!<br /><br />i wear them belted or alone, sometimes with a soft bralette, flats sandals or chic with a blazer and pumps! they would be perfect if i didn\\'t have to get them hemmed, but i am short and petite. other then that the pants are great. love love love love love these pants. the pattern is a touch psycho, but... what the heck? they\\'re for around the house anyway. straight up and down pattern, soft, lightweight fabric, comfortable, they make great slop-around-the-house pants, good get-dirty-if-you-have-to gardening pants, excellent love-this-pj-top-wish-i-had-some-bottoms pants... in fact, any kind of pants you like.<br /><br />they have a slight elastic in the waist, the drawstring is actually what holds them up. they just pull on over your behind and sit comfortably on hips or waist - wherever you want them. the length is perfect for me (i\\'m 5\\'5\\\\\\\\\") and i have almost lived in them since i got them. wash easily, wear easily.. gimme more! good it was what i expected, it is not form-fitting, is big on the legs. i bought it for my girlfriend, measures 1.57 inches tall and weighs 52 kilos, would recommend. i love the fit and style of the pants. the only thing was that the button holes on the side were too small and button didn\\'t fit through. but it was a minor fix. i am really enjoying them. very comfortable and fresh; perfect for our tropical weather. great fit, nice material love it they are awesome!! the colors are vivid, the length was good for taller people like me and they stretch well for wearing. totally recommend them! our first grandson was just born this month, so i am hoping that these pants will fit him very soon. nice quality material but my xs feels like it\\'s gonna fall off even when i tie it tightly. lots of room in the pants and generous waistband. love it just a bit small but i make it work it fit alittle tight .. .but, be in the safe side. have other one on hand. ....could rip undexpectly .. comfy, stylish, practical huge pockets ( that was my favorite part seriously). quite original. this product was just as i expected. awesome comfortable pants. but is there anyway i can get a discount on my next ones? these have to be the softest pajamas ever! the feel of these pajamas is different that any other baby clothing i have found..it is made of bamboo which i thought was a little weird but it is awesome.  they wash really well and have not faded in color at all in 3 months. it ran small for a large size.<br />even so they are very comfortable. they wash very nice. i wouldn\\'t recommend drying. these are sooo amazing, these are the best yoga pants i\\'ve ever had. it is amazing material, it\\'s super thick. and they aren\\'t too tight or too lose. i love them so much. totally worth the price. very nice nice heavy duy pants but still comfortable and lightweight enough to be able to move and bend my daughter wears these constantly.  love! i am 5\\' 9&#34; and 128 lbs. i ordered a medium and they fit well. they are so long i could easily wear the tallest heals i can find and they would still be to the floor. ill be trimming the bottoms so i can wear with flats (no hemming required as these wont fray). i will be ordering more, although i will probably get a small next time. these were a bit baggy on my kid, but he\\'s a tall slender baby so not surprising. they hold up beautifully in the wash and the color hasn\\'t faded yet. overall i like these pants. they do fit a little big but that\\'s okay because i\\'m pregnant and will be growing into them. they are comfy too. i want to order another pair even! but its unavailable. love them so much i wear them often enough that i\\'ll soon need a new pair exactly what i wanted. very nice i was looking for a more affordable cargo pant to wear to zumba class. they fit the bill, with ties at the ankle, so i can scrunch them up at at the knee if i want. the detailing really sets them apart and they\\'re comfy. this is the 2nd southpole item i\\'ve bought from amazon and am impressed with both. fyi: my normal size was a bit loose at the waist. very amazing pants... &#34;elektro skull&#34; too! love it fits great and arrived on time!!! i\\'m a size 0 and hate finding maternity clothes- the ankles  on these pants are big but they fit well my daughter loves these big girl panties. the padding is great for training. it helps absorb when she has accidents. my daughter is really tiny and hard to find panties that fit. i would recommend for potty training. they are really cute also! ...they run small! order one size up from normal and you will be very happy. i ordered &#34;beige&#34; and they turned out to be mustard-colorded.  don\\'t order the beige.  that is why i gave it only 4 stars.  other than that, they made my but look fab (even my bf commented without my having to ask him if it looked nice) and they are oh-so-comfy! so i\\'m 5 8\\' 130lb. since i\\'m mostly leg these didn\\'t fit like the picture, but they\\'re cute regardless and i\\'m happy i got them.<br />stay wonderful!!‚òÜ good fits well! and just the length i wanted, since i wanted to wear these under dresses. excellent pants i like my sweats a little large. these were perfect since they have a draw string and they weren\\'t too large in the legs. loose, but not huge. i ordered two at the time. i have ordered two more. pants are great. fit nice, look nice and make me feel &#34;zumba freaky&#34; i highly recommend these cargo pants to any zumba girl. super cute! i bought it for a trip to jamaica that was cancelled.  i can\\'t weat to wear it.  i\\'m 5\\'9&#34; 175 lbs and it fits cute!! i love these pants. love love love. i have since bought them in almost every color. the fit is great, the fabric is not too thin, the silhouette is very flattering.... did i mention i love them? receivede on time and the box was not beat up for a change. item is as expected. these are really cute and comfy pants. love the pants but too big. order down a size and i\\'m sure you will be happy with them. very comfy! these are sper cute and a great length. however, one size fits all is still a little small for me (size 12 pants)lets just say the little skirt doesnt cover up the camel toe.... i love america!  i love it and wish there were more of it.  these o500\\'s represent my love for america.      if you see me at the bench press from the side wearing these pants, you see nuttin but stars and wonder \\\\\\\\\"why is he wearing polka-dot-star-pants?\\\\\\\\\".  then bam, i turn and face you and my patriotism rushes forth from my full frontal pant/flag explosion and smacks you across the face and screams to you ... damn right ...     america is my spotter! good pants. i bought them because they were on sale. who doesn\\'t need more yoga pants? at less than $5.00 that\\'s a steal! butt isn\\'t see-through either! wife loves them. excellent care and products at the expected time as well as the just boxes to package size what they don\\'t tell you is that the two side seam pockets will neatly hold up to 24 slim jims. gets way stretched out once worn for awhile but they do fit nice these pants are amazing. the material is thick and has great quality. i would prurchase from this seller again. these were for used for a motown costume and worked great!!  received lots of compliments from everyone attending the party. i lovvvvvvve them!!! their so soft and stylish. these are perfect. i just had a baby and im very self conscious. i needed something comfy but stylish too. im going to order more. my waist after baby is 42 and large fit perfectly. just in case you guys were wondering. but i definitely recommend these joggers!! small and great fit they really do look like jeans but they\\'re so much more softer and more comfortable to wear.  only issue i have is that they are very long... i will have to cut and hem. cute. got the job done. good i\\'m usually an 18/20 so since it was juniors, i went up to 22. they fit perfectly. they are made of a very nice material with natural stretch and i love them. perfect for work! super cute! bought them for my boyfriend & likes them! says they fit great & now we joke about him being my stud puffin. there are nothing better than zubaz washes well & color never fades. my 1st born wore them & now my 2nd child is wearing them 14 months later my favorite hat, very soft, lightweight, and cute.  have this hat in the small size and liked it so much, ordered the next size up so she can keep wearing it.  fast shipping.  very happy. these are the pants from that one movie joke you\\'re thinking about..... they don\\'t even look like yoga pants because of the jeans look, and they\\'re so comfortable! i will probably buy more of these. very comfy pjs.  i love the way they fit. i purchased a medium and they fit perfect. a hole ripped in the thigh seam on the first wear but still really comfortable and i love the print arrived timely and fit like expected i\\'m glad these pants fit me comfor<br />tably and are so thin i won\\'t over heat will need another forsure! loved the style, but it was too small. slytherin pride. they fit amazingly one slight issue the seam is very noticeable and it\\'s not a thick as it seems to lead you onto believe i can\\'t wear pink,blue,black,red,or even yellow under wear they still show kickee pants runs a little small, but you won\\'t find softer, nicer baby clothing anywhere! these were for my husband who wore thru his other sweatpants. compalcido excellent product overall mind this set is so cute.  it arrived way before the expected delivery date.  the cotton is soft and stretchy.  the princess logo on front of tee is like a patch of high quality sewn on it.  the ruffles of the skirt are so cute.  the skirt has an elastic stretch waistband.  the headband is also stretchy and is a cute accessory.  would strongly suggest. ;) nice everyday ware beautiful , very comfortable and come with a gift a pair of socks and stikers best deal in terms of price. gerber training pants look more comfortable though and have smoother cotton. our two-year-old has these, gerber, and potty patty training pants. these ones, the luvable friends, tend to run a bit smaller in size than the others, so i think i should have gotten a size up in the luvable friends. i bought an assortment because i didn\\'t know which would be best. i am glad i avoided getting the real expensive ones (who on earth would pay 11 dollars or more for a single pair of potty training pants?!) and am glad for the assortment we got, but overall i tend to pick out her gerber pants over these ones for her to put on. the potty patty ones are a bit too thick. i love them not to tight not to lose just perfect i gave it a whole day wearing them n working out n i loved them they are very comfy i recommend you getting then they cam way befor due day so five starts gift. i read about these on a travel blog but at $200 i was like, &#34;no way!&#34;. but i took the plunge and i can honestly say that i have never loved a pair of pants so much. they are truly the most comfy pants ever. i have never felt fabric like this anywhere; it\\'s so lightweight and so comfy! they\\'re not knit so even after spending 10 hours on a plane, they looked perfect without being baggy at the knees like what happens with cotton pants.  i live in texas so i appreciate the fact that they\\'re so lightweight and cool. i never felt sweaty in these all summer long. i get compliments every time i wear them. the pockets are nice and roomy which is a rarity in slim pants.  the only complaint i have is that the waist is kind of roomy; which is better than the opposite, i guess!  all the better for eating a big meal! real long and a little loose, so hoping washing on hot water will shrink it some. but otherwise, rally soft and comfy! these shorts are cute and perfect for my bikram yoga classes. only issue is that they\\'re longer than i thought they would be which is unfortunate since im so short (5\\'1) i ordered a size larger than i normally would have but the larger size fit as expected.  i am athletic & most pants are too wide at the waste & too tight at the thighs & buttox. these were perfect & i wear them every chance i get. kickee pants uses astonishingly soft bamboo fabric for these cozy footies. the fit is fairly standard (though the snaps may gape a bit on babes with especially chubby thighs); the stretchy fabric makes it easier to get on wiggly babies, and the fleece inside the feet is a nice touch. these are one of our absolute favorite gifts for new babies. so far my girl friends favorite. good quality.  my husband is very happy with these. i like the pants except for the fact that i can\\'t shorten the legs.  it seems that most rain pants i\\'ve purchased have this same problem.  most come with a 30 inch inseam or more.  my legs require more of a 29 inch inseam to be perfect.  i\\'ll try and tailor them as i like the fit otherwise. just got these. they are really comfortable. perfect for lounging around the house, travel and running to the store. i will definitely be using the for travel.  they are cute and versatile. they fit pretty true to size. i am 5\\'6 almost 5\\'7 and #135. curvy on the bottom and smaller at waist. the medium fits perfect. love them:) i have 4 pairs now red, blue, black,and white. i wish there was a straighter version of this as well.  i am 5\\'10&#34; and these are actually long enough for my 35&#34; inseam!!!  finally. very good product. not itchy- no complaints from my two year old. kept the baby warm as can be. would certainly buy this product again when she needs the next size up. will definitely order more colors. came stalking the net for more after receiving my first pair. love them aaaa+++++++++++ these are wonderful for potty training, they are just right if your little one has an accident.  my daughter instantly recognizes that she is wet and we travel to the potty.  but they do what they\\'re supposed to do and i would recommend them for anyone that is potty training. i love these pants!!!! it cam 15 days faster than i expected and they even sent a little card with it (hand written) thanking me for the purchase, great choice to buy a bit see through but i can manage :) i lost a lot of weight and was very afraid that it would be too small or to big. i order a size 13 and fit great. i love it but it was way too small but i gave it to my niece the tights are nice and thick, they fit perfectly on my legs, but the print is blurry, you can\\'t really tell from far away but up close you can tell. my pants came in today and they looked just like the picture if not better they look even better in the black light. sweet these are very hot to wear outside in the summer. i wear them for a physical activity under shorts and was very uncomfortable. when you wear them and they stretch, the colors appear duller. they wash well but don\\'t use the dryer. they are a great fit! and look stylish. the most comfortable and fun pants. i love them. it is a thick smooth, slip-like material that feels almost like pajamas, but hangs beautifully and fits nicely around the back side which makes them slimming - yay! they are a bit long... i am 5\\'3&#34; and wore 4&#34; heels to compensate. trimming the legs will be an easy fix, since the fabric is not the type that frays or runs. if it came in other patterns i would have them all! great item i just ordered the wrong size these are awesome.... zipper was a nice surprise. well it works better than the yoga dvd i purchased. even though i don\\'t really wear it when i\\'m doing yoga. i wear it when i\\'m going to the store, and walking my dog. i have a taylor spatial frame (tsf) (like a halo used for broken necks, only this is on my lower leg and foot)  the tsf has a 14&#34; foot plate and these have been the only pants i have been able to get over the frame, otherwise i am stuck in skirts, dresses or night gowns.  i am short (5\\' 2&#34;) and wear between a size 4-6 and they fit perfectly on me.  the one size fits most may be a bit deceiving for someone that is a little larger.  the length is perfect for me and doesn\\'t get caught up in the wheelchair wheels. these pants fits perfectly.i\\'m 5\\'7 167lbs i love the way the fits my body.l ordered a size large. loved it i\\'ve only had these for a few days, but i am very pleased thus far. i have put them through 2 asana practices and some lounging around. i am 5\\'2, and while these are a tad bit long, they are are not so much so that they warrant hemming. the sizing seems accurate, as the small fits as it does in most other brands. the ratio of stretchy material to cotton is higher than in most comprably priced pants; so they seem to hold their shape (and mine) nicely, while maintaining the softness and breathability of the cotton. i like the foldover waist, it is longer than in some and reminds me to hold in my lower belly. the color of the &#34;plum&#34; seems more &#34;grape&#34; in real life than in the picture. i preformed a bend over test, and according to my husband, there is a bit of &#34;see through&#34; factor, if you really look for it.. i hope to review these again later to see how well they hold up to washing....but so far, i am very pleased with these for the price. *update. this made it through my whole pregnancy and are even more comfy postpartum. i washed them in a gentle cycle and line dried them, and after 6 months of heavy use (all the way through the end of pregnancy) theystill look great- no piling and only the faintest of fading. * updated again: after 2.25 years of heavy use and gentle washing, these pants are finally showing their age, with tiny elastic threads showing through in the most worn areas. so worth the money. replacing them asap. all i can say is that my wife says it allows her to do yoga without binding up in tighter clothes, but all i can think of is how fabulous her buns look in them. just what i was looking for. compliments my curves & apple bottom. highly recommended. this pajama set is very comfortable, and fits nicely; i\\'m very petite, and the fit is quite comfortable not too big. nice soft fabric too i usually wear 12/14 in pants so i ordered xl. the pants fit great...just way too long. i love the fit, the feel, the material.  beautiful colors in the material. these yoga pants are very comfortable. a nice weight to them. not thin like some others i\\'ve bought. they do seem to run small. i have very small legs/hips and they hug them nicely. if you normally wear a medium i would go up size. also i\\'m 5ft 3 and cut off about 3 inches. as someone else suggested i didn\\'t try and hem them. because of the material they roll slightly but not bad. i\\'d buy again. these are a heavyweight pant, just what i wanted.woldgym makes other, lighter weightbaggies that aregreat to wear during a workout. i love this pants, the purple color is really great, they also fit similar to a legging but the fabric is so much better because it\\'s not see-through and soft feeling. i highly recommend this. i  bought 3 large long in olive, black, and urban camo. these pants are oversized until washed, they shrink to the correct size. versatile and durable, they hold up to punishment well, and they don\\'t constrict  me when i\\'m running, on the ground under a car, climbing, ect.<br /><br />these pants are all around quality, good for casual wear, any athletic or dirty work application, and the solid colors would even be alright in most office environments. they\\'re available in multiple sizes and colors. i will be buying more. its nice and warm, and really comfortable. doesn\\'t slide down due to the high waste i bought 2 of these and they fit perfect at the waist and hips.  so comfortable and good quality but they were super long so i had them taken up  by one inch (i am 5\\'10\\\\\\\\\")  lucky for me my sister-in-law is a seamstress. great people to work with i had ordered and the sides were off, sock sent back and they helped me with the sizing and exchanged them they fit much better.<br />thanks these aren\\'t jeggings and they aren\\'t leggings and they aren\\'t jeans.  they are an amalgamation of all three. styled like a jean, they are made of really soft, thick (winter-weight) stretchy, cotton-blend fabric.  i bought the plum purple color thinking it would be more of an aubergine, but instead it\\'s more of a very saturated, rich dark purple--which i think is attractive, especially since i hate the color purple.  they are a great color for breaking up the all-black look i tend to fall back on when i don\\'t want to think about styling an outfit. i usually wear a 10 so i bought size large. i\\'m 5\\'7\\\\\\\\\" 138 lbs with very long legs. they run big! if you\\'re between sizes, definitely order down. i will be ordering the other colors i plan to buy in a medium these are just the right full length (they cover my ankle) but they easily roll up to capris. . they are very stretchy and they lose their shape a bit after the first wearing, but i was able to get two wears out of them.  the tag says dry clean only or hand wash, but i washed mine in cold water (front loader) and line-dried them with no shrinkage and no ironing. i must however wear them with a belt or they fall down.  i love the fit--not as skin-tight as a jegging and not thin like a legging, these are fitted through the thighs/knees but they don\\'t strangle your ankles. they are substantial enough to wear on their own but are fitted enough to wear under a short dress or tunic without looking bulky.  and best of all, they arrived beautifully packaged in pink tissue paper with a little note saying thanks for the purchase and a coupon for $\\'s off my next purchase.  excellent delivery and that extra touch was well-appreciated.  it made it feel like i was unwrapping a gift.  classy. i like the paratrooper style pants as i carry quite a bit in my pockets all the time.  the button closures on the pockets are much better than velcro as well, as they won\\'t get messed up over time and buttons are easy to replace.  i will be buying more of these pants.  their only downside is the sizing.  i have about a 34 inch waist, so the mediums are a bit too snug, and the large is just a bit big, but using the sizing straps on the waist of the pants and a belt fixes that. these yoga pants are great. because they are described as \\'junior\\' i went with a size medium, i\\'m 5\\'-4&#34; 130 pounds and they fit perfectly. the pants are super stretchy and comfortable, although they are about 3&#34; too long for my short legs i still love them, will be easy enough to hem. perfect to wear around the house or out running errands. at this low price i\\'ll be purchasing additional pairs in different colors. i love the stretchy material and they\\'re perfect for going out, casual wear or even work. the only thing i didn\\'t like us that they\\'re very narrow from the knee down so if you have very thick legs i wouldn\\'t recommend these. bought as a gift. i received these today and i ordered a few sizes up. i\\'m 5\\'1 and wear a 0 but read the reviews on the sizing so ordered a 4 and they fit great. i like mine a little loose those. the quality is great and will definitely be ordering more of these. very comfortable as well. love them. i love the material and they fit true to size. i had a horrible time finding these in xxl, but now that i have, i\\'m sure my friend will love them at christmas.  we both enjoy the idea of being in ravenclaw house, and it\\'s obnoxiously hard to find ravenclaw merchandise compared to gryffindor and slytherin, or even hufflepuff.  (what the hell is a hufflepuff? - a very potter musical)  these aren\\'t particularly thick pants, but for summer or early fall use they\\'ll be perfect. wore this through 8 winters in germany months at a time with no heat source...hot meals...and yes...no showers!!....its a lifesaver!  slightly itchy yes but sure beats freezing to death...on a side note i\\'ve tried all the new blends since and they aren\\'t worth carrying home for free...this stuff works! my wife loves to wear sleep/lounge pants around the house, and these have been her favorites since the day they arrived.  perfect fit, softer than most, and very comfortable.  plus, she\\'s a chilly bird herself, so the colorful pattern of chilly birds on these pants suits her. very very nice! so much better fit and quality than i expected! not too short either! shipping was good also! it was a gift and fit just as others described.  this made it perfect for my family member.  thank you, great fit. most definitely will be buying again. good price, looks really good in them, goes with anything and really comfortable. as expected. thank you i love the waist on these and the flowy leg. a little clingy on the thigh but its fine. i like them. it look nice on you/perfect /i love it great pants, full length zipper makes easy work of taking them on/off with boots on.  should of bought these first instead of several pvc pants that tore and were thrown away - wasted money. would recommend these to anyone who spends alot of hours in a rain suit. i like how soft and comfy the pants are . i really like these for the price, i love the comfort, good material, good length, but the thighs and the butt seem to run a bit small - i am medium in the waste and legs, but i am a large typically butt and thighs and these are quite tight in the butt and thighs and the back of the waist is low because my butt is using the extra material. light weight material that prove to be very comfortable. i would recommend this pants to a friend. will buy other colors very cute...love the fabric and the fit. i am excited to wear these this summer. although it\\'s a little expensive, i absolutely love this belt. the shield seatbelt buckle is amazing and i love the colors and comic book style. it\\'s also very adjustable which is great if you\\'re overweight and have trouble finding awesome belts. i would say it\\'s a must for any captain america fans who have loose jeans! this shirt is adorable! a great tribute to the movie billy madison, definitely a great quote for a baby shirt. my son has no idea what it says, but we sure do get a kick out of it! the pants are really good quality,,,they arrived on time    the slight problem is they are very stiff,,takes many washings to \\'break them in\\' i normally wear a medium, sometimes even a large. i ordered these in medium, and they are huge (wide and long). i\\'m pregnant, so i don\\'t care. they\\'re comfortable and will fit me through and after pregnancy. but if i were not, i would exchange for a small, and i almost never wear small. these pants are amazing. seriously buy this product! i have not bought myself any new clothes in a few years and needed/wanted not for work pants i saw the picture and after reading the  description, i was excited.  they came today, 2 days after shipping, no less!  i tried them on right away..  they fit fantastically. nott tight, as roomy as i could hope for.  love the lining and texture of the pants.  i also love the fact they won\\'t wrinkle.  i am so happy.  i normally am adverse to purchasing clothes if i can not try them on first.. though i am short, these pants are too long, even with heels.  that\\'s an easy fix, with a quick hem, and the rest of the outfit fits well.  love it otherwise and many compliments. can\\'t get enough of the kickee pants. so soft & extra cute. very good quality fabric, the pants looking great and comfy. i wish there were a couple of pockets, but other than that - super!<br />delivery was way faster than expected, and the packaging was classy: could give it as a gift! doesn\\'t have pockets i bought these in black, green, nude, and red. the brighter colors are fun to wear. these are high-waisted, to the bellybutton and i have to roll them down a little to keep them inside my pants. however, they are very comfortable (!!!) and they offer no visible panty lines--even in your tightest jeans...which was my goal when buying these. the fabric is on the thicker side, but not heavy enough to wear alone. use only as underpants. they make your butt look really nice and smooth--so much better than a thong! i would also recommend these as better coverage underpants underneath sheer summer skirts, shorts, and dresses. note: pantyliners don\\'t stick very well to the fabric. i am pleased to say that for me.....these are the best fitting leggings. love them.. was a great product overall but were too big for my newborn god-daughter but they fits her now and they are great. great seller, items arrived even before proposed date these pants are ample sized and can fit a wide array of sizes from medium on up to xl (or xxl). i bought them for a special occasion and have not laundered yet--will buy again if the dye does not bleed out in the laundry. pretty color on both, the pants and dupatta. wish it comes in more colors for this size 2nd pair same type same vendor, great fabric, soft, comfortable, nice fit, great length, great price, delivered faster than estimated, it gets no better. i needed a pair of grey pants and after looking on numerous websites i decided why not try amazon. to my surprise the package was delivered 3 days earlier which was a major plus, when i took the pants out of package they looked as if they weren\\'t going to fit but they hug my curves with just the correct amount of stretch. very pleased with this purchase i will be ordering through amazon again because it\\'s hard to find the perfect pair of skinny jeans around here. i normally fit 8/10 and i exchanged these for an xl. there meant to be a baggier look the xl was perfect. perfect fit, nice look... even the pockets look real (but they are not).  these are just printed tights and look very very good.  my wife is a little modest though so she wears most of her leggings with shorts.  i think she has worn these that look like jeans without shorts however.  as an admiring husband, i lead a happy life. i loved these so much i bought 5 more pairs in different colors light, perfect for summer, good quality.  i wish there were more colors to choose from and sizes.  5 stars.  thanks. i like the pattern and it is as shown.  they are thinner, which is weird since football season is in colder weather.  after washing them 3 times, the color was faded already.  that was disappointing. i would recommend this to anyone who is half as patriotic as i feel while i wear these. they fit just as i expected and are very high quality. they get a lot of attention at the gym or in public (of course) and many compliments. i love them. great for price ... on time delivery, fit true to size chart &#34;dopeeeeee it fresh fits great nice product love the color and the pokets thanks a lot man or girl :) these actually fit well, without muffin top, and not too much cheek hanging out.  wish they had them in red, as i am now in a crapshoot for another pair that fits as well! i ordered the small and i am 5\\' and 115...they fit perfect in the waist and butt but were a little long for my 5\\' height. i will wear a pair of platform wedge sandals this summer and they will be great comfy, adorable, well made and great price! yes, i like it , it`s well manufactured, shiny , beautiful and looks like it`s very resistent, i`ll recomend to the people who wants buy this kind of motorcycles products to beware with the measures , if you are 34 of pant you have purchase this in 36 or maybe more cos it`s a little bit small that standard size of a regular pant. thanks. to fox and this seller. nice product good quality is okay but great for the price overall! buy it! these pants do run a little big.tter than running a little small. i love these pants. the pants are comfortable and really make you sweat. they are a little noisy but they really do work. i will definitely recommend the pants to anybody that wantshe to sweat off extra inches. really comfortable pants. exactly what i had expected. the fitting chart is a bit weird, but i managed to get the right size first try. they came from india, so it took a bit of time to get them here, but overall i\\'m happy with the product. these underpants for toddler boys are just what i needed. great quality fabric and prompt delivery. i would buy again if i need more. these are the softest cotton based pants i have ever owned.  you will not want any other casual pants. the first time i put these pants on, i went outside and caught a bald eagle with my bare hands and tamed it. i had to train him to peck the italian supermodels who throw themselves at me the instant they see the stars and stripes flapping in the breeze, clinging to my 4\\' calves. want to know why? they\\'re not american that\\'s why<br /><br />every morning, i put on my american flag pants and print out a copy of the declaration of independence and consume it for sustenance before i hop in my ford f650 and drive to work, which is walmart. i manage a store, because they got one good look at this 100% constitutional garment and collapsed to the floor, weeping with pride for the usa of america. i was instantly promoted and make $17.76 per hour.<br /><br />on the weekends, the first thing i do is put on my american flag pants (both legs at one time, of course), and crane-kick communists, muslims, and socialists of every variety.<br /><br />i own nine pairs of these. \\'murica<br /><br />(oh, and the sizing chart is pretty accurate. when they arrive they\\'ll be massive but wash them and they\\'ll shrink down to perfection) perfect fit and very cute. you can wear these anywhere. a little less stretch than i expected but happy with fit if you purchase smaller thinking it will stretch don\\'t do it...i\\'m 5\\'10, 155lbs ordered a 5.. these pants fit nice and loose.  they are comfortable and the stripes look superb.  the material is not cheap.  great buy. good producted but the pants run a bit large so i had to send back it back and get a smaller size i love all the stuff i get 2purchase @amazon my daughter is 12 and skinny.  we had to adjust the belt over the double stitched area near the buckle to make the belt fit and it fit perfect.  she has a waist size 12.  good solid product that will last years not months.  the belt is like a real seat belt like a eddie bauer baby car seat would have. and the buckle is car quality safety buckle.  clean design stitched in the belt so there will be no fading of the design. great! these pants fit and look great. i am 5 \\' 2&#34; and the length is perfect. wife loves this pants, they fit her really well and look great on her.  very comfortable as well.  she\\'s very happy with these. i especially enjoy seeing her walk around in them. fit is fantastic and sexy as hell i was really pleased with the alfred dunner slacks.  they fit well and look sharp; they don\\'t require any special care.  seems to me that alfred dunner clothing is always great.  i surely was glad to find them online.  i live in a tiny village now and there\\'s no place to shop.  thank goodness for being able to locate what is needed online! i\\'m a female, so the crotch is pretty saggy unless i role the waistband once or twice. bought this for my hubbies sister and shes gonna love them! nice and soft and the design is adorable! cute and very well made. they seem a little small. husband loves it snug like yoga pants should be but not to tight beautiful i simply love it. great fit, fabric and style. they are ok, you get what you pay. i am 5\\'4&#34; 110 lbs. and they are tight on me. real tight. i would order these again. fit great, great quality. i am very happy with the product and how fast i received my items. nice pants.  wearing them makes me feel like pumping iron and treating women poorly. awesome! these are fantastic! i am 5 foot 1 and 108lbs, i ordered a size small, they fit great and the colour looks the same as in the picture! i will certainly be buying more of these yoga pants....probably 1 of each colour!! got these for a last min performance they fit well and looked great. will by again came across these great gingerbread men pj bottoms for our \\'gingerbread man loose in the school\\' day that i plan for my students with clues that take us from location to location trying to find the gingerbread man!  my kinder colleagues and i have planned and coordinated this for several years ! i desperately need gingerbread man pj\\'s and could not find the perfect simple, not too christmasy and not only in red and green and came across this cozy pair!  not only that but an old family friend!  rene rofe was a very close friend of my parents and growing up his children were our close friends too.<br /><br /> to see rofe\\'s name on the random pair of pj\\'s i was purchasing,  brought back lots of childhood memories of modeling some clothes (ha-me modeling) when i was in elementary school and the good times my sister and i shared during the summers by their pool especially fun labor day family parties. ya know, the only family back in 80\\'s-90\\'s in our town with one with the coolest slide! rene- congrats on the success of your business.  hope e, a and amy are all doing well.  please send my love and best. thank you for the most comfy pjs and my colleagues and kinders loved them. :-)all my best. j. diamond i have the hardest time finding pants, especially dress pants, that actually fit my curvy body.  i am not overweight, but do have a booty.  i have been compared to kim kardashian, though my derriere is decidedly much smaller.  my point is, for anyone looking for pants that fit women with curves, these are for you!  smaller waist, american thighs, perky butt.  done.  they fit like a dream and don\\'t flatten my tookus like a pancake, there is still room to move and they are cut in a very flattering way to accent curves in all the right places.<br /><br />the waist is wide and very comfortable. the material is silky soft!  the softest pants i have ever felt.  they are wonderful and feel very expensive.  do not wash/dry them, it will take away that softness.  whoops.<br /><br />i wish they had these in regular length! so cute but when i gained weight during my pregnancy these stretched too thin and we\\'re see through in the butt region. cute, cute, cute!    when i openned the packege, i thought the pants were too small. but i got my nerve up, and pulled them on.    fits like a glove, and lo and behold.... it has a cute tiny little flare in the leg i hadn\\'t noticed before.    a neighbor came over to visit as i was trying them on, and as soon as i opened the door, she had to know where i got juch cute pants.    for a price like this, i am definitely getting another pair down the road! i have long legs and do love them, but i am used to pants either barely being long enough or needing hem taken out, not needing to be shorten as these do. i love these pants, especially because i\\'m such a lazyass lol. i love soft comfy pants to lounge around in, and i like cargo pants because they\\'re comfier than jeans, they\\'re casual for public, and they have pockets for storing things. these pants are all in one. they\\'re cozy like sweatpants, but casual at the same time so you can wear them in public more comfortably if you\\'re kind of self conscious about wearing sweatpants in public (i\\'m not of course, but some people can be) because they look more like actual pants and not pajama bottoms. you can sleep in them, wake up in them, and go out in them without having to remove them. the pockets aren\\'t quite as deep as regular cargo pants, but they will suffice for most of your needs. if i didn\\'t have to go to work all the time, and if my ass didn\\'t smell every day i would never take these pants off for the rest of my life. great fit but very long. super comfortable. i will order more. used to spending hundreds on work out pants- no need<br />my daughter wants some now! my kids are big bang theory fans and loved these jammie pants. they are comfortable and have held up well best cargos i\\'ve come across in years. however, next pair i know to get a size or 2 smaller, but that\\'s my own fault. can\\'t wait to get another pair! practical and cute. im a public speaker and recently underwent surgery on my leg and hip. im in a wheel chair and needed something that looks nice, and is comfortable and practical.<br />these are adorable. great fit nice material wore them the same day they arrived will probably get a few more with different camo designs i\\'m a size 6 got the med and they fit fine. a little snug but they are supposed to be skinny.  don\\'t get an extra large if your a size 6 like the other review said!  if u are really a 6, med will fit<br />fine. i got it promptly and it is for sure what i expected. very good quality. i\\'m very happy with it. these are the pants i wear to my yoga class.  they are exceptionally comfortable, meaning that i am not aware of them when i wear them!  good quality as well. i\\'m 5\\'6\\'\\' and typically wear a size 4 or 6 in pants and the medium fit great. they are high waisted and although they stretch after a few wears, a quick wash and dry tighten them back up. they\\'re so comfortable and stylish, i wear them around campus, to dance, and even going out. i received earlier than expected, it fits very well and the quality is very good! my friends said it\\'s awesome. i am very happy with my purchase! this is even cuter than pictured!  the material is really soft and the color is to die for!  great purchase and can\\'t wait  for the weather to c!  ool to wear it cute and comfy. refreshing to get a plus size that actually fits. i really like these training pants. they are soft, loose enough around the legs but tight enough to stay put and the extra padding in the center helps to contain some of the spillage that happens during training. i will definitely get more. nice i ordered these as a christmas gift and the recipient was very happy with them. they were more purple in person than they are in the picture. perfect! love them. my baby is 8.8 so he is a little bit bigger than average of the nb, but they are very comfy and soft! 4 stars because the toe is going to be too  small in the next 2-3 weeks now fitting him perfect. comfortable, lightweight hotpants! great buy. these are really beautiful leggings! the color is a bright clean looking white that is almost too pretty for leggings! fyi -if you wear these you will look really dressed up and everyone will compliment you! i look forward to wearing  thesewith a new floral print tunic top i ordered! awezome! i ordered this for my daughter. she uses them for her yoga class and she loves them !! highly recommended !! cute and comfy. as mentioned in the title, the pant is really comfortable, but for my 5\\'5\\\\\\\\\" and 125plbs, it is a bit too loose. super comfy, roomy, and just what i expected excellent buy! awesome really cute bought these for my 7 year old to use over his pants in the spring to keep them dry and clean, worked great! had trouble receiving package but package was reshipped!  very grateful for a good experiance! i bought these for ski, actually i really like roxy so i was looking for a good  and warm pant. i usually wear a m but i order a l, because i dont want to feel it to tight, and it was a good choice, because fits perfect!. these pants do run small, but i read reviews before ordering it and got the correct size. i\\'m normally a size l, and i ordered and xl. they fit perfect!  it\\'s hard to get on at first, but once you do, it feels great.  the only reason i\\'m not giving them 5 stars is because over time the faux leather started to rub off where i sit down on the back.  that\\'s to be expected, but i had only worn them about 10 times when it started coming off.  thankfully, they sent me another pair.<br />also, every time i wear these, it turns heads.  i\\'m almost 40, and some teenage boys were taking pictures of my butt in wal-mart one day, lol.  :) i love these pants! i love the color and i also love the way they feel. they wash nicely. hardly any piling and i have washed them a lot! they run kind of big. i bought the size that i thought i wore and they are kind of big. however, i liked these pants so much that i went back and bought the black pair. they do feel a bit heavier weight fabric and i bought the same size and they were a bit too tight, so alas you can never go by the size. that is the only complaint that i have...i love these pants! arrived three days early, very soft and comfortable, fit perfect. love them. i\\'m so happy with these!<br />ordering more right now.<br /><br />tip: don\\'t forget to purchase a size or two smaller.<br /><br />love very unique design. what you see is what you get with this piece. it\\'s definitely better to wear on colder days during fall & winter.<br /><br />glad to have it. :) love the way they fit and i got so much compliments!!! very comfortable!!!!! very nice for price. maybe go one size up of you have muscle thighs these are the best paintball pants i have ever owned.  to get the right waist size (i wear a 42 waist in most pants) i ordered the xxl which fits easily.  the pants are slightly long and a little baggy but i prefer that personally.  the cinches in the legs and waist tighten it up fine.<br />pros:  1. lots of nice features including zippered main pockets (a must) and a correct sized squeegee pocket (some pants the opening is too big and your squeegee/swab drops out constantly).<br /> 2.  good mobility<br /> 3.  reasonably cool.<br /> 4.  pretty good padding that is not too thick.<br /> 5.  very adjustable.<br />possible cons:  1. my pants came with light greenish gray instead of black mesh areas as shown in the image.  i think they look fine but fyi.<br />2.  the areas of black in the image over the groin, thighs, and calfs (not the front over the shins which are padded) are mesh without padding.  this keeps it cool and flexible, but i haven\\'t taken a hit there yet to say how well these areas protect and i suspect it could sting a bit. veri nice i bought these for myself for christmas. they\\'re really comfy, fit well, and my son\\'s girlfriend thought they were cool. win! really comfy great pants, very soft and stretchy. they are lasting for a while! i wish they had more colors/designs. the x large is really big, i bought a large this time? i think they will be just fine. the fabric is really nice, i like it a lot. comfortable & nice quality the pants are very roomy and seem to be very comfy.  they seem to be well-made. i would recommend to a friend. i purchased this outfit based on the reviews and boy were they right! not only did they have fast shipping (i got it within  3 days) the outfit was absolutely adorable. my 6 month old son wore it for a wedding this summer. it was light weight and perfect. we did buy him the 12month size because he\\'s a big boy and i read the sizing was off. the 12 month was perfect. he was a big hit! we got so many compliments on the onesie i had to cover him up because he was getting more attention than the bride! but seriously, he still wears it to other special occasions and around the house... it\\'s held up through washings and it was just a good buy overall. i was completely content with it so much so that im writing this review. so stop looking and buy this one! bought this for my pregnant wife (at 23 weeks). it reached quickly and fits well. she loves it. we will buy again. they are nice and they\\'re soft too.  i had to trash 3 of my old ones, they got stains and the no amount of washing got the stains out.  i had done business with this company before.  and i will do business with them again.  they arrived when they said they would. i love the style and quality of these pants!  they are the classic cargo style i have been searching for and i think they will last for years.  i am a size 6, and based upon the sizes listed, i ordered a large, and they are very roomy.  i have no problem wearing baggy cargoes, but if i order another pair, i will get a medium. my 6 month old crawling grandson doesn\\'t like socks so this s perfect alternative! great lounge pants. see through and sexy. my husband loves these pants.  he feels extremely passionate about the stars and stripes.  the only thing missing is a complementary bald eagle with each purchase. \\'merica. awesome fit! i\\'m 5&#34;11 athletic build and the mediums fit fine. we purchased this for my sister in laws wedding and everybody loved it! fit great and looked super cute on our son who was 3 months old absolutely love these pants! the fit was perfect and they are high quality! i will definitely be ordering more! super comfy and dressy enough to wear out. love them!! they ride low, but they are a great fit and look purchased these pj\\'s a few months ago along with an extra pair just in case these decided to rip like other ones i purchase from a different company...i must say, these are very long lasting, softer after every wash and the most comfortable pj i have ever owened...great for lounging....excellent price and a great a+++++ seller...thanku!!!! i sure the uniforms were great but my husband didn\\'t get the job so we returned them unopened but the price was excellent. perfect fit these are cute and comfortable if you order your true size and where them as intended...live in florida love the weight and how they fall i got these as a gift for my husband and he loves them.  i love them!  i wish got a pair for me!  the fabric is a bit rough but i think it will soften after a few washes.  i definitely recommend washing it before wearing for the first time as they do seem to be treated with some kind of chemical.  all in all, i am thrilled with this purchase. very nice pants, kept me very warm. worked great under my bibs. was out all day on a 8 hour ride. was warm the whole time. would recommend. good fit for the price. i wear these pants probably 3 days a week, gotta buy another pair or two so i can wear them everyday.  be careful of the length though. they are very nice but cheaper material; pilled up after first wash. wife still loves them though. they are very warm and comfortable. these trousers are lagenlook with an ethnic twist. so stylish and comfortable, it\\'s a pleasure wearing them. the fabric is lovely and soft and hangs beautifully. they are very comfortable and althought they aren\\'t as thick as i thought they fooled all my friends into thinking they were real jeans. the strechy fabric breaths nicely. totally worth the price! i found these pants very comfortable but wish i had ordered a larger size even though these claim to be of so many inches. considering ordering the large love that it isn\\'t a &#34;fold-over&#34; waistband, so there is no extra bulk!  the material is a bit dressy, wish it was more of a cotton knit, but they are very comfy. i would recommend these pants to anyone looking for comfortable fit, soft to the touch and funky design. these pants are fun and eye catching! the drawstring adjusts the pants, so you can make the crotch shorter or longer. love these! super light weight! fits great! i bought these pants with matching long sleeve t-shirt for my usaf vet husband, and he likes them! they are just right for cool mornings. it took me thirty years to realize that life is more like [[asin:b0019l0acm the foot fist way]] or [[asin:b001ibidli eastbound & down: the complete first season]] than [[asin:6304981635 enter the dragon]]. dreams and aspirations are more golic-ic than favrelike. we can\\'t spinkick a round dream into a square hole, unless the dream\\'s radius is less than half the length of one side of the square, in which case it might be a tight fit or make a squeeky noise. when i tried to plant a roundhouse heel to the face of my karate instructor, i fell short, and tears of shame ran down my paunch into my tight karate robes.    sitting on the curb in zubaz is much more comfortable. the waistband\\'s elasticity and adjustable drawstring keep the pants firmly on my hips but comfortably without pinching; pain does not exist in this dojo. and unlike the conformist white robes of my old dojo, i can get it in many colors like my favorite teams. nothing says \\\\\\\\\"i\\'m a cleveland browns fan\\\\\\\\\" like a size 38 waist hidden behind the chocolate, orange and ivory tiger stripes of zubaz. or that you live in cleveland. that would say you\\'re a browns fan, too, probably. but the colors: dude, a drawer full of zubaz makes my dresser look like a [[asin:b001ha6iyy ~:~ binney & smith / crayola ~:~ classic color pack crayons, wax, 64 colors per box]]just had a litter of lil wax pups.     we can all swing for the fences, but who will trim the high grass of the outfield? zubaz saves the day as the loose fit is cool even on a hot summer day. so wear your zubaz with pride, because you\\'re a realist. you\\'re average. you\\'re a golic. say it. \\\\\\\\\"i\\'m a golic\\\\\\\\\". the leggings is nice, it is standard size does not stretch much, it\\'s more for girls size s but is sexy fit was perfect i followed everyone\\'s advice and bought a size larger and they fit to a tee. these are the most beautifully finished pants i\\'ve owned in 25 years. french seams and hand-made frogs, they are simply put, perfect. i wear them as evening pants with heels, and beach pants with flip flops, very versatile. i\\'m 5\\'4&#34; so, these fit me more as high waters than crops, just right. i ordered two of them.  i loved their style and material.  the chemical smell is unfortunately terrible and i wish they had used other types of material.  hopefully it will leave after several washes.  otherwise really comfortable and they definitely keep you warm. the fit of these palazzos is comfortable and flattering. definitely a go-to for just about any occasion, including relaxing at home with a good book or making a statement when you walk into a room. keep in mind the material is thin and lightweight, but the stretchy fabric and the style create nice movement. as i said before, it is very comfortable . -- yes, the printed palazzos are quite long (and come hemmed), but they can be cut to the proper length. the solid color pants i ordered are about four inches shorter than the printed ones, and are unhemmed.  -- i emailed the seller with a question about that, and received a response within ten minutes.  i\\'m happy with the service from this company. they fit great perfect for under my summer long dresses. i am 5\\'5&#34; and ordered a medium.  the length is just a tad long.  the overall fit is great.  the material is quite lightweight and thin but is fine.  it will keep me cool.  am not too enthused about hanging to dry, but as long as i don\\'t have to iron (i don\\'t own one!), it will be okay.  if there is no ironing required, i will order the other two colors.  would like a larger solid color selection. my husband loves the fabric these pants are made of as well as the way they fit and feel.  from my point of view, they look great. he likes the heavy elastic waistband and the deep pockets.  he especially likes the lack of elastic at the ankles.  they seem to be an excellent product. body is on the small side of the one size fits all. they look and feel nice. good experience i am short (5\\'4) with thick thighs and a big butt but a small waist, i got a medium and their perfect! usually pants are too long on me and these do touch the ground but not by much. so comfortable, and cute! thank you! i love the slimhot¬Æ women\\'s hot slimming capri pants. i first started with the xl hot pants from a more expensive brand but they started to fit too big after 2 months. the large size was fitting too tight in the beginning but they are feeling more comfortable after wearing them a couple of times (my hips are 46 inches). they make you sweat like crazy. so far i have lost 3 inches from my hips and 2 from my waist. they work but you have to exercise and follow a cleaner nutrition. i am now wearing a slimming belt underneath the pants as well. i was skeptical, but now i see them as a workout tool. you still have to eat well, workout and keep yourself hydrated. awesome ok... here\\'s the stats... i am 5\\'8&#34; tall... usually wear a 14/16, my body shape is a curvy hourglass.  these fit me perfectly.  i have to report that i shared them with my sister who is 6\\' and a similar but longer body and legs than i.  they fit her a bit better for length.  i will say that the pants i received had quite a bit more yellow flowers than the photo really shows...  but she loves them.  the navy tank she happened to have on while trying them on was actually a good match.  i own several pairs from this seller and i would advise that you follow their sizing info.  these are just perfect for traveling as i do, no wrinkles and lightweight.  i do throw them in a gentle machine wash and tumble dry at very low or just hang them to dry.  if you haven\\'t tried these, you\\'re missing out!  a great look for many body types and if you travel as much as i do, the perfect fun/casual/dress it up pant! i have worn them twice to rave reviews!!<br />they are best worn with a  blouse similar to their own in fabric and style.  they are a hoot! i purchased these as a gift for my niece. she was thrilled with them. fit true to size and would highly recommend. these pants are great. i was worried the fabric would be stiff. however the fabric is breathable and light. i am 5\\'7&#34; and around 170lbs. they fit great. the waist band is very flexible. i am really happy with these pants. my son wants to be in the air force so i got these sweat pants a gift for him. he seems happy with them. the are about what you would expect- he says they are warm,comfortable, and fit well. fits well over jens / sweatpants ‚Ä¶ its a bit roomy but not too roomy, i like that. bottom cuffs close snugg over boot.  :)  light weight and wonderful. these pants fit well and are very soft.  no problems with the letters coming off which i was a little bit worried about. high quality fabric, very soft and fits well. really helpful during training pot. my 2 years old son uses all the time. very nice pants! i got this in black it seemed to fade quite a bit in the first wash. i thought that it would be a bit thicker material. my 9 month-old baby girl was already a huge fan of the kicky pants coveralls (playsuits), so i decided to buy a couple of these footies for her to sleep in.  the quality is everything you would expect from kicky pants.  the pjs are made of super-soft bamboo viscose and lycra, so they\\'re comfortable against baby\\'s skin, and they actually seem to get softer each time i wash them.  and due to the stretchy lycra, they\\'ve got lots of \\\\\\\\\"give,\\\\\\\\\" so they move around with baby and aren\\'t constricting at all.  the temperature-regulating ability of these footies is wonderful as well.  my little-one loves sleeping in footed pajamas, but with summer almost here, i was concerned that she might get too hot in the fleece or cotton footies that she\\'d slept in during the winter months.  because these kicky pants footies are made of bamboo viscose, they keep my baby a few degrees cooler in warmer temperatures, and wick any moisture (sweat) away from her skin.<br /><br />these footies would be just about perfect, were it not for the somewhat awkward 6-12 month size.  this is a pretty wide age range for baby clothing, especially at a stage when many babies experience growth spurts in weight and/or height.  my almost-10-month-old is on the petite side for weight, but she\\'s of about average height, and the 6-12 month sized pajamas were super-long on her.  i\\'m talking 2-3 inches of excess material in the legs and arms!  the width fits her just fine, but the pjs are so long that she trips over them when she crawls and i have to roll up the sleeves so she doesn\\'t chew on them.  needless to say, she can\\'t sleep in these footies, since they come with a warning tag saying that they must fit baby snugly in order to meet flame resistance requirements, since they aren\\'t treated with (toxic) chemical flame-retardants.  (that\\'s a big plus in my view, and one of the reasons i bought these pjs in the first place).  so i put the 6-12 month size in storage for now, and purchased these footies in the 3-6 month size instead.  well, guess what?  they\\'re too short on her!<br /><br />perhaps my baby girl is at that \\\\\\\\\"in between\\\\\\\\\" stage where she\\'s too short for the larger size, but too tall for the smaller one.  but as i said above, 6-12 months is a major transition stage for many babies, so i\\'d be surprised if my little-one is the only baby in this predicament.  perhaps kicky pants could consider making these pjs in 6-9 month and 9-12 month sizes, instead of going for such a wide 6-12 month age range.  until that happens (if it ever does), the 6-12 month pajamas are best suited to tall, lean babies only.  otherwise, you can\\'t beat these footies for comfort and quality.  b+ i\\'ve had the exact pair of jammie pants for ten years and i wear them every night to bed. i bought them in a small shop in colorado.  they are soft and so comfy.  when i found them on amazon i bought 3 more pair so i\\'ll always have a pair around! cool pants for a city girl like me:)<br />dress it up or down no biggi just really sexy.<br />big up to my urban outfitters!! fit great! wore them for a vietnam reenactment. elastic pant leg gatherers are better than original non-stretching type. these pj fit great-nice and soft ! these are great yoga pants!  the length is good for those of us who are taller than 5\\'7&#34; (lots of yoga pants are just too short for me), the fold over waistband is a great size and very comfortable (snug without binding), the fabric is soft and stretchy without feeling too much like spandex workout clothing, i\\'m just glad i ordered two pairs.  they\\'d be fine for your workout or for pjs.  i will definitely be ordering these again. fits as expected and very comfortable. love them! cute. love the fit and the material soft and extremely comfortable ! thank you i bought two of this product (white and pink) for my 16 yo daughter for her track & field.my daughter loved it. she told me that everyone loves it. everyone is asking her where she got it. it is very stylish. the material is a little bit thin but not totally see through. true to its size. i totally recommend it.the shipping was fast. um bom produto. chegou a tempo e a qualidade √© boa. o unico problema √© que n√£o entrega no brasil. i usually wear a 16 so i decided just to be safe to order an 18 in these since they are juniors size. they are so cute! my waist is 35.5&#34; and my hips are 48&#34; and these fit perfectly!! i will have to hem them because they are really long, but that won\\'t be a problem at all. so cute especially for the price! the product was of high quality and arrived very quickly.  i am very pleased with the overall look and feel of the product. i love these pjs they are so soft, cute and fit great. my lo is about 3.5 months they are a little big but i order 6-12 mo. he is about 14.5 lbs. i would say they\\'ll fit for the next 3 or so months. they tend to run one size to big. but they fit as i\\'d expect them to i had another 3-6 month pair that fit him until this week, he can still squeeze in :)<br />overall i love these pjs they are cool for the summer months especially under his swaddle. wasn\\'t sure how they would fit but i needed up  buying more pairs already. i\\'m 5\\'5 123 with a baby belly still and they fit great.. my son loves the buggy pattern, they do not hold bigger accidents well.  these are very soft and wash well, size is a little larger than expected these pants are awesome! i solely purchased them based on the reviews of others, and i am so glad that i did!! they fit so nicely, don\\'t lose their shape and are very flattering! i ordered them in the white fold-over and the salmon color. they are both super nice. i am 5\\'7&#34; and 135 lbs and ordered a medium. they are great. can\\'t say enough nice things about them! you won\\'t be disappointed - and you cannot beat the price! i purchased these to wear for a day walking around in nyc. we were going to afternoon tea and i needed leggings to go under a dress. these kept me warm all day. they have a shine to them so they also looked a bit fancier than regular cotton leggings which i liked. i am about 118 lbs and 5\\'5&#34; and they fit. they were a bit long. i don\\'t know if i could wear them on their own but under a dress with boots was perfect. the only complaint i had was they started to pill as i was wearing them. i did wash them and they seemed to wash okay. i haven\\'t warn them again since washing. i received the package in less than a week of ordering. for the price i think it\\'s a good deal. i love these pants!!!!  however, i was somewhat disappointed after washing just one time for the black to look faded and dingy :(  now they look old and i\\'ve worn them once! being apart of the best service branch in the usa i live and die semper fi , i must say these are a good brand . loved the fit,  will definitely buy again very comfy with room to grow for my chubby 7 month old great so far! awesome product, they are in great shape and seem pretty adjustable. i am only 5\\'9\\\\\\\\\" and they fit great could probably get them even tighter or add a lot more length. cant beat these for $10! i must say the print is a little generic but they are so comfy and soft it doesn\\'t even matter, great to work out in or even to just lounge around in the quality of the cargo pants were better than i expected.  the fit was great and i was very pleased with the product. purchased for my son for christmas!  loves dr. who...  these are comfortable, a great length and wash well. our son loved the lounge pants.  made a great stocking stuffer.  fit perfect. excellent fabric quality, punctual delivery time, colors and size as expected. i recommend<br /><br />the customer should be free to write the number of characters you want, please modify this form to give feedback, because this uncomfortable. i did not think it was as good quality for the cost however i am very surprised quality is good, the only thing is that it is small. these are terrific pants -- they are soft with a good feel to your hands and very comfortable.  they also look great and the pockets are just where you need them, very convenient for carrying anything you need with you.  i don\\'t know if brown is really the new black, but these are a great color -- they are not your grandfather\\'s brown!  i also own the khaki and will probably order the black or olive from captain dave next. love these very comfortable! so fun! great. i bought one pair for myself a month ago and two other pairs as christmas gifts.  i got lots of complements on them and had friends asking where i got them - but i think amazon.com and their website is the only place they sell them right now.  i like that they are exclusive.     the fit is great because its not too short or tight like the other sweatpants that i\\'ve bought.  the bottom of the sweatpants cuff has an adjustable elastic drawstring so i can keep them out of the snow or pull them up in warmer weather.  the fit at the drawstring waist is also very comfortable and i also like the side pockets and velcro flap pockets at the back - so its easy to hold stuff like a wallet, cash etc. the logo patch is hot too - their designs are simple and stylish.      i am ordering the [[asin:b001okge3c 3lwp full-zip hooded sweatshirt: versatile peaked hoody with pockets and patches]] to match my sweatpants.  i\\'ll be ordering more sweatpants as soon as they get new colors in. overall professional customer service, fast shipping and a awesome product. this works very well and i have used it many times, it\\'s cheaper than new pants. i plane to but more for use on several other pants at the same time. i\\'m a tall, curvy girl always looking for a good fitting pair of pj\\'s that fit my waist and my long legs and these are ss comfortable as could be with room to move in! i love hot topic\\'s pajama pants! the best ones out there! adorable but the 18 mo fits more like 12mo. i bough this so i can use it for a halloween costume for a 3 month old, and the size is great, once again for a 3 month old baby, but the pants are a bit long, but by very little, its definitely perfect for what i need it for. great this fits really good, it makes you feel comfortable and hot at the same time. the quality is good also. this was just the type of pants my mother likes.  she liked the color and fit.  she was surprised that came as quickly as it did. just a tad too big, but the quality was better than expected given the price cozy and fun. they fit perfectly. these are my third pair of crazee wear baggy pants & i\\'like them a lot. very comfortable & a great loose fit. bought two of these for my girlfriend and i. the fit is as advertised and they do run short as they are designed to go to your boot tops. i bought the longs and the length is perfect for my 5\\'7&#34; frame. my girlfriend is taller and they fit her as well. these are very warm and work great over sweat pants or jeans as an extra layer. they are not designed to block out a windstorm so be advised that is not their purpose. however, if you were to wear these under snow pants etc, you will indeed be very toasty and warm. you won\\'t find better fleece at this price. polartec designs their fleece for military abuse and they will last a lifetime. the zippers are heavy duty and work smoothly and the suspenders seem quite adequate as well. just received my order today earlier than i expected.my wife order the suits made by valentino last thursday from darya trading inc thru amazon.very fast delivery. i am very satisfy with quality and material. hand tailored in italy. perfect sizing.perfect pricing/very cheap for a high quality of suits made in italy made of australian wool/silk super 150\\'s. also very friendly customer services. i plan to order a few more.    jeffrey, lancaster, ca. i was worried that this would be too small or too tight since it\\'s sized for juniors. i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; with a 29&#34; waist and 32&#34; hips, and it fits like a glove! no pinching or muffin top or anything! that was my biggest concern, so i\\'m very happy.<br /><br />i only gave 4 stars because my boyfriend mentioned that when i bent over he could see through it a little. not really bad or anything, but enough to notice. so i would keep these for more lounging around than any actual yoga. unless it\\'s just yoga with the girls. soft and comfortable, and fit well sooo comfortable!! i had to trim the bottoms only because i\\'m 5 feet tall. but i absolutely love them!! they are great! like i thought i\\'d need.<br /><br />so either these run large or i\\'ve lost inches in places i didn\\'t know!!!<br /><br />they were very comfortable to wear for those few minutes before they fell off....... i have long legs and these pants fit well. very soft. good items! great tights. nothing wrong. got the shipment sooner than expected. they fit snug but that\\'s expected. if you are a bigger curvier girl... i don\\'t suggest these. if you have a small waist and big behind and thighs they should look great these fit my son past 3 months! i liked how they had the elastic at the ankle. it helped keep the pants down. size like expected. everything looks good. fabric is good cotton. my neice loved it. very true to fit and lovely colors. i think a boy or girl could wear this. perfect for my man!  we both love them! lite, airy, just absolutely awesome pants!! the misses says they are very comfortable. i am 5\\'1 and 120lbs with an average straight shape. they are a little more snug than i wanted but they are comfy and forgiving. so although i would prefer a little looser for a fit, they fit fine and give way to being really comfortable. they are long and drag on the ground for my short stature but i like them that way. but for the price and comfort i love them. i would buy them again, maybe one size up. these leggings are great and feel comfortable...they are just a tad long.  mine sort of bunch up loosely at the bottom, but i\\'m hoping with a few more washes they will tighten up.  other than that, love the leggings overall! oh wow!  these pants are the most comfortable i\\'ve had on in a long long time. they feel good even when i\\'m just sitting around the house watching tv. i debated getting them but i\\'m glad i did! i may go ahead and get all the colors for the heck of it. i loved this any time i wear these out, i get so many compliments on them. i love the look with boots and a long black top, but they are small as others have mentioned. i wear a size 11 pant because of a larger hip size, and they are a bit tight. if they had a size up, i would have ordered that, but they don\\'t.  also being 5\\'8&#34; they\\'re a little on the short side, but i don\\'t plan to wear them with anything other than boots, so i\\'m not too upset.  i\\'ve worn them several times while being relatively active and i haven\\'t had any problems with seams ripping or anything. great pair for the value. picture does no justice! the actual pants looked so much better than the photo.<br />it is so comfortable but at the same time trendy, and it\\'s my go to pants for practically<br />matching with any top. love the zipper detail on the ankle. looks so cute with some casual platform sneakers.<br />only thing is, i wish the pockets went a little deeper. fast delivery too. soft, pretty, waist band tight for the size most comfortable thing to wear after the baby. i weighed around 140lb postpartum and small fit perfect.  you won\\'t regret it! got an xl for the girlfriend. i think we both enjoy it when she wears it :) exactly what i wanted nice quality and perfect for exercise or just wearing casually around the house.  i would recommend them to anyone looking for this type of pants. they are so comfortable! i even bought a second pair!! i\\'m thinking about buying another pair! i just wish they were a little cheaper. great fit.  i\\'m planning to purchase more. the material is light weight and flowing. delivery was right on time with no delays. great pant strong and pocket on knees are great to put pads would order again but one size bigger runs small i love this! these tripp\\'s came on time, and the box was not damaged. unlike the picture these tripp\\'s are not a solid black. they have shades of dark metal blue, and black. which makes them sharp looking. they fit perfect, and loose. we got this outfit for both of our 20 month old twins and highly recommend it.  the outfit is positively adorable and they love the vibrant colors.  they look like such little ladies in this and it was great to see them this fall in the rich earth tones and surprisingly pleasant orange.  the top is nice and slightly heavier than many we\\'ve bought, so it\\'s warm and toasty for them outside or in the a/c.  good fabrics, great fit, easy care, and we, they and everyone else love the look...an absolute winner all around. i am so happy i finally found a pair of yoga pants that fit me! i am 5\\'3 with a fairly small waist and these pants (size small) don\\'t drag like most of the others do. the material isn\\'t the best quality, but it is thick enough so that your underwear doesn\\'t show through, which is all i was looking for. very comfortable. i recommend, especially for shorter girls. i read the that the pants were i lil too small, and on the recommendations they sabjusted to choose a bigger size that i normally get! i bought these as a gift for someone and haven\\'t given to them yet. the material seems good quality though and the material is thick, not the flimsy see-through stuff you sometimes get. a must have for any dachshund lover. very warm and cozy. getting hot here in phoenix, can\\'t wait for cooler weather to wear them again. great sweatpants. read reviews and still ordered these.  husband hikes mountain 2x a week.  5,000 base to 12,000 feet, in all weather.  other reviewers are correct.  these pants are made of black paper bags or, as some said, garbage bags.  however, he loves them.  lightweight and truly waterproof.  the zippers alone are worth the price we paid.  terrific solution at great price.  much better than &#34;water resistant&#34;  big name pants.  &#34;water resistant&#34; doesn\\'t cut it for his application. love it! these are stretchy and super comfortable. love the pattern and fit for a great price! i gave four stars instead of five because they\\'re kind of see through but they\\'re so comfy and soft that i\\'ll definitely use them as pajamas and for around the house. for the price, i\\'m pretty please! perfect i am 5\\'3&#34; 120# .  small is a comfy fit; any bagging is compensated by the toggle adjustors on legs.  the nylon is thin and airy and i ordered a second pair! i don\\'t know why this has received only one star, it\\'s my ultimate baby pant! i bought four of them in two sizes because i\\'m terrified it will not be in stock when i need it. it\\'s perfect for the day over a onsie! i love that it\\'s soft and thin. the baby can easily wear it as an extra layer or as a pajama with a top underneath. must buy for any baby\\'s wardrobe! excellent item while these won\\'t keep your child\\'s pants completely dry in a potty accident, they certainly help. they seem to be true to size, and very well made. really nice material by at least one to two sizes up, my son loves this i\\'m 5\\'4 and tall was 2&#34; too long. i love this outfits!!! a must have for any new mom!!! i bought one in each size!!! i usually don\\'t review products but that is how pleased i am with what i got. i love it, they look great!<br /><br />good material and feels sturdy but i haven\\'t tried washing them yet.<br /><br />note: the model in the photo must be short, i\\'m 5\\'7&#34; and the leggings part of it is not nearly that baggy, they don\\'t make it to my ankles. but they still look wonderful and feel super comfy. will work over his pants well if he has to work or ride in the rain. gets linty after first wash but true to size and colour i bought these in the 3-6 month size when my daughter was just starting at daycare at 4 months because they kept the nursery room so cold. these pants are super-soft. now that my daughter is 16 months (almost one year later) we still use these as \\\\\\\\\"nap pants\\\\\\\\\". they are a little short (capri-style, anyone?) but they are still soft and perfect for being cozy in the crib. recommended. great option whwn you look for comfortable pants<br />great color, it fits pretty good<br /><br />i definitely recommend it !<br /><br />if there is any other color i will buy some other nice fit and the material is soft and silky. perfect for me! right length, right tightness, right price. i love them. very good. white is good fitting is good all is good you are asking for too many words still too many words you are making what was once a good experience now poor i love these jeans!! it\\'s so hard to find good plus size jeans, but these are very cute, flattering, and comfortable. used them for the first time it was 20 deg (f). went for 5 mile run and my legs were toasty warm the hole time. fit perfectly, very comfortable, and did not restrict or slow me down! love them! love the pants great price great i got these for a costume and loved them. they were super comfortable and looked great. i am sure i will find an opportunity to wear them again these fit as expected and the colors are a beautiful navy, violet and taupe.  they come down to my calf.  i bought a sleeveless tunic top to wear with them.  these are a cotton print .. it is not a cotton knit.  there is no give in the fabric - except for the elastic waist.  they come with a cute matching bag. happy with my new pj pants! i intentionally bought a medium when i should be a small (size 6 normally). they fit great! i hate to think how tight a small would have been. i am wearing these post-partum and they are working out very nice. much better than jeans and more fit and attractive than pajamas. also the knees don\\'t bag out too much, even after a couple of days of wearing them. 5\\'2&#34; and 155 lbs (most of my extra weight is in my mid-section and my legs) - i was worried these would be too long.  you can fold over the top to adjust the length a little. these are the most comfortable and sassy pants ever!  not too clingy at all. nice pants, professional looking but durable. love the pant, need to reorder a larger size. i am a muslimah and needed a wide legged pant for both wearing under abayas and wearing during pregnancy.  it will work very well. it covers the ankles and part of my shoe. it is very comfortable. with ability to stretch at the belly. can use post pregnancy too.  alhamdulillah! working construction in the summer is tough enough without having to settle for jeans.  lets face it 90% of everyone on the site is wearing jeans or some other heavy fabric pant.  these are awesome.  they breathe great.  the material is the same that they make military hot weather clothing out of, so they are going to be durable as well.  the first day i wore them to work everyone wanted to know where i found them. the only reason i didnt give 5 stars was the price. i think for the price they should have reinforced knees. my husband loves these pants. nice weight and fit.  he gives them high marks in the comfort dept. i love it very comfortable work out pants. fits very well on time delivery. and i love the pants, extremely comfortable. these gerber training pants can be hard to find.  the training pants were just what i expected and a competitive price. these high quality cotton pants are unbelievably soft and well made.  my son has sensitive skin and these light-weight soft cotton pants keep him comfortable all day.  will be ordering more.  wish they came in more colors!! i like these, but i think it is important for customers to note that these do not have pockets.  if you want to carry small objects then you should choose one of the other motherhood varieties. nice soft and warm. very comfortable excellent slacks!  i bought the purple pair and the red pair for my elderly mother and she loves them!  she\\'s in a nursing home and they do her laundry for her.  so far the slacks have held up well and fit her great.  the only thing that would help is if they came in a size 6 petite short, but since she sits the majority of her day, you can\\'t really tell they are a little bit too long. purchased as a gift. my son is a marvel and dc fan. took this item from his wish list. if he likes i like!<br />fabric-good quality(thick)<br />economically priced. i absolutely adore these pants.  they have a very high end, well made feel to them, so worth the $$.  i highly recommend them to anyone needing a slim look. shipped very quickly, wish there were more colors. quick shipping.  just what you need for working out at crossfit. being 6 months pregnant i found these a great alternative to maternity yoga pants. the fold over band comes high up on my belly which provides great comfort. the material is pretty thin, but is nice because i don\\'t get too hot i received these and was planning on wearing them for the 4th. i hung them in the closet next to my three wolf moon t-shirt. apparently, there is only so much awesome that universe can handle because the close proximity of these two wondrous apparel items caused my house to explode. fortunately, my banana slicer remained intact so i can still enjoy the holiday. it fits as expected, although it was a tad shorter than what i needed. it is comfortable to wear, and it\\'s a bargain for the price. pants run a bit short, however, i bought them for my son who is on the tall side.. the overall size in the waist is true to size. they are not a heavy weight so they will be perfect for our climate. this skirt/legging combo is very light weight & soft.  it wears well to yoga classes and afterward as well.  i only wish there were more colors.  i will likely order the gray set in the near future.  i did find that the large was a little loose, but that was not a problem.  i ordered a size larger than i thought i would need, so it\\'s possible the medium would have been a better fit for me.  for the price, i found this skirt/legging to be an excellent investment & i recommend it for use with yoga/exercise classes. thiss person clothes are different which i love. however if you are larger than a ten they will not fit right.if you like a different style of clothes that these are for you and the price is right the shirt is a good size.  not tight or clingy nor is it baggy.  the image stood up well to a gentle washing. looks and feels great! i was afraid these pants would be too big on me since they are one size fits all, but they fit perfectly and were not too long (like every other pants in the world) and i\\'m 5\\'2\\\\\\\\\". the pants are very flattering and really comfortable. best of all they are inexpensive. i highly recommend them. this pants are the same as what is worn in the military. the background of the company propper - the largest supplier of military apparel to the department of defense. since 1967, has been manufacturing garments to military specifications.<br /><br />pants have...<br />left and right butt pockets, w/buttons<br />left and right hip pockets, fairly deep<br />left and right thigh pockets, velcro with pull strings<br />left and right ankle pockets, velcro<br />fly is buttons purchased in dove ivory color. loves these. please sell some in black option i am really happy with these. i couldn\\'t find them in the local stores and i think pull ups  confuse the toddles because they are too much like diapers. potty train was a success and i didn\\'t have to use them very long. i also ordered rubber pants which i would suggest doing because they hold the urine in when there is an accident. both together worked great! i like these jeans a lot they\\'re just a bit long on me, i\\'m 5\\'3&#34;. i love these and will buy more soon. awesome work pants. incredibly sleek and soft to touch. only disappointment was mini belt loops only fit for skinny belts. my husband loved them.  nostalgia was the reason i bought them for him.  he faithfully watched r & s with our son. could be longer for taller gals.  still a great buy and very comfy. i yoga and lounge in these. my son loves these pants! shipping took a little long but not enough to take away a star. these have lasted many grass stains and the rough wear of a 12 boy. i am very pleased at the construction of these pants. just got these in the mail today, and soon as i put them on, i loved them! they are so comfortable and soft to the touch. i read a lot of the reviews before purchasing this item, regarding the fact that these yoga pants are comparable to that of victoria\\'s secret yoga pants. this is true! they fit great and are very flattering.<br />when sizing, make sure you following the instructions. these pants are originally made for juniors, so definitely buy a size up for comfort if you wear women\\'s sizes. i am 5\\'6&#34;, but i have wide hips so i wear a medium for most clothing. i ordered a large just to be safe, and i am glad that i did. they are snug, as they were made to be, but i still have a little bit of extra room for comfort.<br />i am definitely going to buy more colors from this seller. excellent choice! i have really long legs i find it difficult to find leggings that go all the way down, but theses do, they are very comfortable, the only thing i had an issue with is that they are very thin and even see threw, but still love them. i really like these pants.  they are super cute!  they are a bit snug in the hip and buttocks area. i bought these pants for our nonprofit.  they were very soft, true to size, quality was very good, colors were great, as pictured, and they arrived timely.  i would definitely recommend seller and product. this is my second pair.  i took a chance on the first pair (can\\'t remember from whom i bought them)  and they fit perfectly, looked well and i decided to get more, hoping there would be a selection of colors to choose from, but there was only black.  if they had more colors i would buy all of them. in the meantime i now have two pairs to alternate. they wash very well, too. great product! super comfortable and very patriotic they fit very nicely, definitely would buy again :) i am very please with these pants.  they look good and are comfortable to wear. very nice pants that don\\'t shrink in the wash nor during wear. they fit as promised. pockets would earn them  stars. cozy i love them!!! i loved these pants as soon as i got them. i am 5&#34;7 and they were the perfect length. just don\\'t wash them. they shrank right up and now they\\'re too short. i\\'m sad. :( &#34;these are the cutest, even better than online&#34; the harem pants are pretty neat.  i have gotten many compliments.  they are better than the picture. it keeps me warm, and it\\'s fairly soft. i could have chosen a different style looking back now, but it\\'s still cute. i\\'m a size 10 in women\\'s, these pants stretch nice and the picture doesn\\'t distort when worn. my 14 year old daughter loves them too! these are incredibly comfortable and warm pants.  the only problem i have had is that after 2 years the seam in the crotch started to go. perfect fit. going to order more. i like these pants a lot but i\\'m 5\\'1&#34; and in week 29 so not really wearing heals at work anymore. these pants are still about an inch too long and drag on the ground so need to get them hemmed. i love these pants, i got them cause i wanted halloween themed pants cause i love halloween lol. they fit great and look great! i ordered mine from bewild.com cause they did not have my size on amazon. also i got some good deals on bewild.com so it ended up being cheaper then ordering on here overall. the pants have cute skull studs, and the handcuffs omg!!! the handcuffs are the icing on the cake and they look supper cute and cool. when i got them, one of the studs on the front popped off, but my dad helped me secure it with a really strong glue and we clamped it down with pliers for about an hour, now the stud is &#34;cemented&#34; on and it is really strong. make sure when you wash them you take the removable chain straps off, and wash on cold, low cycle, so as to not damage them or your washer, you can either let them air dry of dry them in the dryer.<br /><br />i got some very nice compliments on these, every body thinks they are so cute and neat. the zip off legs, that tripp pants are known for, is a very nice addition. the chains dangling in the back kinda get annoying but i deal with it, you could always pry them off though. i might add some jack o lantern patches on them, so they really look festive. i took them camping with me, and i was actually, physically able to skate board in them haha, they fit that nice on me.<br /><br />i love em\\' good stuff! i remember the mc hammer pants of 20+ yrs ago, and these, thankfully, are not those.  the crotch is not around your knees, but is where any normal pair of pants would be.  they are almost like riding pants.  i have plenty of hips, rump, etc., and these fit fine, and would fit someone smaller, too.  need to be worn with boots because the bottoms are elastic-y.  abstract print is attractive. these really fit great and i love the fabric but was not expecting such a flared bell bottom leg.  i actually returned them because of the style.  i am 5 5 1/2 tall and although they were a bit long they would have been ok with shoes or boots with a heel. great product, at a fraction of the price. i used this through all of winter and it was warm and waterproof. this jeans is a great buy. better than the expensive 1 i buy that looked ntn like the pic... cheap and made of nice jean frabric. i love this jeans. ok i have owned these for over a year and i am buying another pair.  not because the one i own ( and are wearing now) have any issues; but because i want another pair for backup.  these rock. i especially love the elastic pant legs. i have 29 inseam and also wear them in cold weather so that is a great feature. they are still holding up after numerous washes and lots of heavy wear. these are my kicking around the house pants so i wear them very often.  i have some others like this from other manufacturers and they do not hold up nearly as well.  so this is my #1 choice. i wish they made them in heavy denim (black) hint hint.  somif you are a big active person that like outdoor activity, i highly recommend these.<br /><br />well made. i wear these several days a week and have owned them for over 2-3 months and they have held up well.  i wear these out hiking and doing work around the house too.  the back and cargo pocket have velcro that hold my wallet firmly and i haven\\'t lost it yet.  the front pockets could be a little deeper. overall i highly recommend these pants. the shorts fit comfortably, but have a tendency to slide down as i wear them. they are the right size, but are simply a bit too short to wear anywhere but around the house or under another article of clothing. these are better than the average cheap yoga pant but if you want a lifted, firm looking butt i am firmly an &#34;alki\\'i luxurious cotton lycra fold over yoga pants&#34; believer. these are more lounging pants than yoga, as they have less elasticity and feel more like a lazy day pant than an activity pant.<br /><br />these fit well and are maybe a smidgeon long. i\\'m 5\\'9 (a longer torso than legs) and 150lbs. so far this has been a good product.  my mother has only washed them once but they fit this small, petite woman very well.  seems like good quality for the price. i must share my experience for all hefty girls out there shopping!<br /><br />i weigh 259lbs and am 5\\'7&#34;. i have been working out consistently on my cardioglide machine and was feeling like i would like a way to isolate my most troublesome areas of bulk. my butt, my belly, my hips, and my upper legs. all the other reviews i read were women who are like a hundred fifty some pounds and i was getting discouraged that maybe they do not create a size for a gal as large as me. i read the size charting and since target brand jeans i\\'m a loose twenty, layne bryant brand jeans i\\'m a fit sixteen...i ordered the extra large thinking well it\\'s worth a try and if it doesn\\'t fit, that\\'s what returns are for. i have to say how pleased i was to discover that not only do they fit, they are a little (not much) loose around my pelvic area. so, score 1, let me get my workout on.....girls!, i workout on my machine roughly an hour four to six times weekly and yes, i\\'ve built up good sweats before....but never as efficiently or effectively as since i\\'ve been wearing these during my workouts. i literally had a trickle of sweat falling out my ankles and then...i\\'m feeling &#34;the burn&#34; of my workout hours into my day!...i absolutely look forward to purchasing these again...most of all, by the help they have provided in upping my game in fitness, i am so excited to be purchasing sizes smaller each time as my problem bulk areas decrease!<br /><br />if you\\'re on the fence about these, i hope my experience has been helpful enough to push you off into the purchased side of it :) good luck and blessings to you all!<br /><br />cheers!<br />sincerely one very pleased customer!!! it is hard to find comfortable workout wear in petites that is not tight fitting or shapeless, especially if you don\\'t like elastic around the ankles.  these are attractive, fit well, and in love the pockets. these fit awesomly, i love them. they are warm and soft. they fit well, which was something i was afraid would not be, because i am heavier than the &#34;average&#34; these are so soft and fit my son great.  i love that they have an extra padded crotch to help protect against accidents.  my son was so excited to get big boy underwear too.  start with these for sure! my daughter loved these and put them to use immediately doing her yoga classes.  thank you for the great buy. perfect! i am 5\\'7&#34; and should not have bought tall length. however, they are made of quality fabric and are still a great purchase. this is for a yet unborn little one.  mommy and daddy do not know if it is a boy or a girl and this is just pure baby!  they both thought it was adorable!<br />perfect for hot texas summers. looked nice great shirt exactly what my son wanted pants are long and rather large in the leg area. although the waist is all elastic and that seems to fit . these leggings are good quality. they look even better than the advertising photo because the colors are not as bright. they are durable and stretchy enough to wear over skinny jeans, which is what i did for the new years\\' eve party i went to. in fact, i was delighted that they arrived in time, only about two weeks after ordering. fast shipping from china! my only complaint would be that the cut of the waist could potentially give you that muffin-top effect-- especially if you\\'re not a size 2-- but if you\\'re like me and you wear leggings how they are supposed to be worn, this won\\'t be an issue for you. these are an attention-grabber and a highlight of my wardrobe now! i\\'m in love with this seller. very comfy and vibrant. no problems here. bought it for my dance school. the girls loved it. will recommend this company. i\\'m in love with these leggings they came in 2 weeks early they make my butt and legs look great!!!! these were bought as a christmas gift for a beloved grandson who asked for them. he wore them all that day and after washing them that night he wore them again the next day. big hit with him and his jealous friends. perfect, super comfortable. the fabric is a bit cheap and scratchy. and it smells really strongly like a factory when it comes so wash it before you wear it. it comes in a really cute bag. it came a day before expected/ honestly very cute definitely recommend. im a bit bigger, plus sized, with a big butt, but it fit me like a glove, and the elastic waist band is super tight so it won\\'t slip down and will definitely fit you if you\\'re skinny as well. quality is very good, thick and cuddly... encourage all moms to buy and the price was good, went well with the matching tops... my 9 month old looked like a lovely little lady... so soft and stretchy! it\\'s very thin, looks a bit goofy on my babies big head..but it stays on! it fits, and the color is fantastic! it\\'s so light weight, my little one has no idea it\\'s on her head..so she leaves it on!<br />this is a very nice spring/summer hat, it wouldn\\'t really keep you warm. we bought it with the intent of having something thin and light to cover a bald baby head. getting a wiggly baby covered in sunblock doesn\\'t always go well, so we needed something to prevent sunburn! this works well for that! my hubby and i love these clothes. the pants are so comfy and look great. i tried these for yoga and working out. very comfortable and well-constructed. i\\'m 5\\'9&#34;, 145 and thought i would wear a medium, but it was too short to suit me and a bit too tight, so i went with the large. i normally like to work out in loose clothing, but these fit so well, i use them for that or just kicking around town, running errands, etc. super comfortable. very sheer, however. i wear spandex shorts underneath. but it was just for a jasmine halloween costume. i still may wear on other occasions love them. but if your tall they may be high waters bc im 5\\'1 and they are the perfect length perfect for just slipping on and heading out the door. i would prefer they were not embroidered but all seems to blend well. i got these because they looked rather ostentatious...and warm. they proved to be both. i ordered medium and they are a bit big on me. i get a lot of compliments from others in the ostentatious-pajama-wearing-club. they think their angry birds pajamas beat out these...i disagree... i love these pants. i endedup buying 3 pairs. the fit well. they flow nicely. the will wear thin and pill over time and washing. recommend dry cleaning or hang drying but i don\\'t care,  they are so comfortable and can be easily dressed up or down - i will wear them until they fall apart. i liked the black and navy blue ones best. very comfy and stylish!  i wear for zumba and theyre surprisingly light! highly recommended! all i need now are zumba shoes and more shirts :-) ok love em...i\\'m wearing them right now. i love that they have pockets and the size is just right my new favorite capris adorable and fun...nice casual pants love, love love eet!!!! looking for some other colors at the moment... i receive my legging yesterday. it fit perfect i love it. thank you ordered size large but the length is a bit too long (i am 5\\'6&#34;).  also, red rolled-waist was not a \\'true\\' red - more of an orange-red.  otherwise product was comfortable. i really like this wrangler  cargo pant, perfect weight material for a mild climate, not to heavy. lots of pockets and the fit is very accurate in both waist and length for the stated size. only very slight downside is the grey is pretty light  in color and i prefer just a bit darker, like carhartts grey color, but it goes great with many colors! awesome! purchased these for someone else.  they love them and the fit is exactly as expected. i absolutely love these pants.  i was so surprised when i opened the package to check the length.  finally, a pair of pants long enough.  i\\'m 5\\'10&#34; with a 36 inch inseam and always the tall yoga pants i buy are a little bit too short.  these are perfect, a wonderful fit.<br /><br />the material is not super thick, it\\'s a lighter feel but still has that nice stretch you need with exercise pants.  i\\'m very happy with these, i\\'ll buy more and i\\'d definitely recommend them. i wore these pants at least twice a week in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of my pregnancy. the material was versatile enough that they could be worn to work with a dressy top or on the weekend with a t-shirt, and they have withstood countless washings and have held up really well. i like the stylish cut and the no-panel look. they were also great those first couple of weeks post-partum -- they were about the only thing i could wear aside from sweatpants that didn\\'t rub on my c-section scar. highly recommended! i may just go buy myself another pair for the next pregnancy! :-) my only complaints are that they don\\'t come in xs (which probably would have fit me better than the s) and that they come only in black -- if they had come in other colors i definitely would have bought one of each! this is my favorite clothing item for my little guy right now. it is so soft and comfy and gets washed often yet still looks pristine. i have resisted buying one in every color for now but look forward to buy more from this brand over the next year! pants fit my daughter ok. they were more fitted like tights on legs. the material is thin so she had to wear spandex under them fits great! really warm and comfortable. i am 125lbs and 5\\'9. ordered a medium and they are perfect i purchased these snow pants for my husband.  he was outside all day during a recent snow storm and his legs were warm and dry all day. he loves how warm and dry they kept him.    the liming is red fleece, very soft.    he loves them. highly recommended. nice pajamas for the summer/fall . the material is sot of thin. it\\'s good for playtime or lounging around. also, it can be worn underneath other clothes. ordered 2 inches too big in waist...should have ordered 1 inch larger. order length like you want it. the vendor would not accept a return as i had washed it, but how do you know shrinkage until you wash it? best pants i\\'ve owned! amazing! love them so much! great super comfy and cute. great shirt! fits perfectly and the picture is so cute. very soft and comfortable. we love kicee pants!!! fabric is so silky soft. i\\'ve found most kicee pants run a small great fit and comfortable.  is holding up well both in construction and durability. excellent! fast delivery too! i love these pants!!! i am a fitness instructor and wear these to my zumba classes. they are nice and baggy in the legs but not too long i the crotch. the waist is tight as people have mentioned but, i love that it keeps them in place. i\\'m annoyed by pants that grow as you move and these don\\'t! the only sometimes problem is that the elastic on the bottom is so long that i have tripped over it, now i just tie it up while teaching. i\\'m a size 4-6, ordered a small and they fit exactly as pictured.<br />great buy! i like the fit and the way they look.  i just took them out of the box and wore them arrrsome pants for any pirate, they keep you cool on the hot days at raids...er ah...pirate festivals, and allow full range of movement in case you need to fight, or run real fast... :d<br />an excellent pair to start with, and if you get a few different colors, you can mix and match to your mood...or to throw someone off your trail...not that i would ever have such a need...o:) fits loosely but thats okay because i plan to wear layers underneath. looked great.  granddaughter loved them i am 5\\'6 and i ordered a large. it fits really well on my legs. not snug and it doesn\\'t have that big space in the crotch area. my only thing is that when i\\'m standing the length is great but once i sit it rises a bit more than desired. otherwise these fit great and are very soft and comfortable. i probably won\\'t ever dry these to avoid shrinking and i think next time i\\'ll order an xl. hopefully the length is a bit better with the same great fit. i\\'ve had a number of these dickies pants.  i like them for work and they seem rugged enough.  the only issue i have is the  &#34;tunnel&#34; type belt loops are simply not big enough for a 1.5 inch wide belt. yes, the belt can fit through in a single layer but after you cinch the belt and want to tuck the loose end into the nearest belt loop it won\\'t fit.  come on dickies !  just make those belt loops a little bit bigger. these are not dress pants where men use a narrow, 1.25&#34; belt.  they want to use a wider work or casual belt made from thick leather.  deserves 5 stars for quality but gets 4 stars on execution. i just recieved the sweatpants and they are amazing, very pleased with them, they feel soft, warm and perfect! 100% recomended     will order more from antonio ansaldi in the future!    thank you these thick warm fleece leggings are perfect for winter temperatures down to below 32\\' freezing.  when it reaches the low teens i wear these under my skinny jeans.  i am 5\\'9&#34; and the extra fabric at the bottom keep my ankles warm ~ what a great design point!  very warm, functional and wash really well.  i highly recommend these. they are a little looser than i thought they\\'d be,but that\\'s ok. they are very comfortable! good for yoga,or lounging around,and or doing yard work. awesome- perfect fit- - very slimming great product good quality productüôã i love these pants! the fit us exactly what i wanted. i\\'m on the talk side, 5\\'7 and these pants are nice and long. also, i appreciate that they are not see through like a lot of yoga pants that i\\'ve purchased. i\\'m just over 5\\'9&#34;.  was happily surprised to find that these are long enough.<br />i\\'m about 130lbs/size 6-8 depending on brands,  and these fit, though i definitely wouldn\\'t want them any smaller.<br />i have small calves/ankles and they\\'re nice and tight there, too which is rare for me.<br />while they\\'re not totally opaque, it\\'s not terribly noticeable.  i\\'d not go commando, but you could probably get away with wearing a thong.  or just wear a long top if you\\'re worried about it.<br /><br />whether they\\'ll hold up over some time i have yet to find out. but initially it\\'s a few bucks well spent. these fit as expected.  they are not see-through and are super comfy for the gym i love the uniform. very comfortable and fit great. i would for sure order many more. i really liked these jeans, but unfortunately i wasnt able to pull them up over my butt.  i ordered a small (i am about 5\\'2\\\\\\\\\" and prepregnancy weight averaged between 108-112lbs and at 20 wks along i am only about 119lbs) according to the sizing chart available and it really was small.  i have shipped the jeans back and requested a medium, we will see how this size runs. i am keeping my fingers crossed, since the jeans were really cute ohterwise! i absolutely love these pants.  i am 5\\'1&#34; and 115lbs and i couldn\\'t ask for a better fit.  if i were any bigger, they may not be too comfortable.  also, if you are taller than 5\\'3&#34;, or have longer than a 30&#34; inseam, they are likely to be on the short side.  the material is thin and gauzy like muslin, but not see through.  the dye runs during the first 2 or so times you wash them, but after that, they won\\'t bleed much.  i have been using these pants to lighten my travel load, since they take up very little space and dry quickly if you need to hand wash them.<br /><br />i\\'ve worn them in hot, humid climates, where i needed to be in long pants, either because there were many mosquitos or because the temples and cathedrals didn\\'t allow shorts or short skirts to be worn.  i like that these pants breathe well and dry quickly.  the first pair i ever bought is now starting to shred at the seams.  they have been worn about 20 times, have &#34;walked&#34; over 100 miles, have been machine washed 4xs and hand washed all the other times. i have never put them in the dryer.  i now own 7 pairs in various colors and the sizes haven\\'t varied, but some of them have pockets that have been sewed on crooked. to adorable i love these pants.  they are so soft, even after a few washings.  if you want to exercise they are perfect.  i think these pants are up there with the most comfortable pants i\\'ve ever owned.  they feel and look so much better (and more discrete) than regular yoga pants or sweatpants.  now if they only had pockets, they would be the perfect non-business article of clothing. i ordered these corduroys knowing that they have tears as part of the design.  its ok, but for me i would prefer the plain beautiful corduroys.  actually the price was what changed my mind.  if you like the distressed look - this is a great pair of corduroy jeans.  enjoy! my teen loves these yoga pants. they are a little long but perdect. so cute love the material, it\\'s cooler so i can wear them when it warms up. the print is so cute and they fit great. love bamboo pj\\'s . . .fits my short and stout 16month old perfectly and there is room to go. very pleased with this purchase. really soft, thin, but nice quality pajama\\'s. first of all i love the shirt, ordered it for a mud run and super excited to wear it! also charm city tees have been amazing with shipping the shirt right away and very quick to respond to my questions! thank you charm city tees you guys rock!!! super cute and so soft!  i love these!  they run a size small because they don\\'t use any harmful chemicals so just order a size up.  i would sleep in them if i could :-) i absolutely love this! it is a little bit tight on me (i\\'m 5ft6 130 lbs & 34 dd) but i can manage. i ordered a medium, being pretty lean i usually wear a small, and the material is great (for what you payed for) i highly recommend ordering! my favorite pants my first pair of palazzo pants, and i love them! i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; and 120 lbs., got the small/medium size, and they\\'re a perfect fit all over. the length is just right so i can wear wedges or platforms with them (flats wouldn\\'t work). they\\'re hemmed, so this is key. there\\'s a little room for adjustment in length by adjusting the waistband. love that they wash well and don\\'t wrinkle...i washed them in a lingerie bag with a regular load of laundry and hung them to dry. there\\'s a piece of elastic around the waist and i thought it might twist up in the wash, but it didn\\'t. i was nice and cool in these pants, a tank, and wedge flip flops even though it was 94 degrees today! love these pjs =0) got a large and fit comfortably baggy. they are long witch i prefer for my js, great buy! these pants are fabulous!!!!  they are a nice weight and cover well so they are not so shear that you can see thru them. they did not shrink when i washed them but washed them on cold/delicate and hung them up to dry. they came quickly and i think these are a great price for the quality. oh!  i\\'m 5\\'4&#34; and length was great. pants were of good quality. the pants were as described in quality. the pants shipped quickly and were very nice. perfect fit, right weight, does not hinder movement whatever fitness program i engage. great quality and looks much better on then in the photo!!! i literally wear it each night! i was pleasantly surprised with the quality of these pants given the price. they are very comfortable and perfect for working out. they are light weight, but not too thin or cheaply made. i found them to be true to size, so no need to buy a size up as with many yoga pants. great buy and would recommend! these pants are great for working color and style into your work wardrobe. i am 5&#34;9 and usually ware size 18/20. after reading the reviews that these run small i ordered a size 22 and they fit great. they are a true skinny pant and fit very snuggly especially from the knee down. i cant wait for the other colors to be restocked. i will probably get a pair in every color! also it is worth it to note that while the fabric is light enough to wear during the heat of a louisiana summer, it is thick enough that it does not show every dimple on your legs. i wore my new suit to church and i cann\\'t tell you the attention and good reviews i got , thanks for a good looking suit to go on a good looking man. when i made my order i was unsure if it wud  fit but when it arrived  it fit like a dream very great fitting  and arrived super fast. very nice with the price. quality military grade trousers. i received this pair of snow cargo pants in a timely manner. i checked with the makers (guide gear) to see if they had a slightly shorter (30 inches long) pair, but they said ‚Äúno, we don\\'t make them in that size.‚Äù although i was disappointed at their slightly flippant reply, i have been enjoying these cargo pants in this frigid weather (2013-2014 winter), despite the fact that i had to spend $45 to get the length resized to 30 inches (this is a medium-sized pair of pants) and to get rid of the secondary sleeves to hug the boots (i don\\'t ski). a toasty pair of pants, to be sure.<br /><br />i also enjoy this product because of the well-placed pockets. the pants are ideal if you are looking for a running pant this is somewhat loose but not quite tights.  i have been using the pants for about 2 months now and have not had any problems.  i found the price to be very affordable for the product.  i think its worth noting that the pants come from the uk so if you\\'re in the us it takes a good 2-3 weeks for delivery.  all in all i would recommend these pants not only for the price but for performance as well. i bought these potty scotty training pants for my son.  he was  just too lazy to use the potty while he was wearing pull up diapers. these training pants are awesome. they are waterproof so there is no mess. he started using the potty after wearing these. easy to clean. wash in clothes washer and the dry on low setting! i bought these because they were cheap (just being honest!)... and they have exceeded my every expectation.  i\\'ve had them over a year now and the stitching is still tight, the fabric shows no thin spots, all in all a great purchase.  i\\'ll be buying two more pair here shortly! just right.. a little sheer i was looking for a legging with a longer skirt, these fit the bill perfectly...i had to order the 2xl, and am a us size medium, 5\\'6&#34;, 155lbs...so please look at the size chart for these and measure your waist and hips! they have a good amount of stretch, but i didn\\'t want to look like a stuffed sausage...i gave them 4 stars because they were a bit wrinkled out of the first wash...after that i washed them with other dark colored lingerie on the &#34;gentle cycle&#34;, and they were perfect. but if you just throw them in the washer with jeans and tees i don\\'t imagine they will look good for long. :) outfit was perfect for our 3mo old son. the pictures turned out great. quality was better than i expected. we were afraid the hat would be to big but it was pretty close to just right. love these bdu\\'s! worked great for the hunt! i also own the purple ones and love em as well. considering buyin the pink and blue, even the discontinued lime if i can find em :) i was thinking asian size all small so i bought a size bigger but this short are baggy and it looks huge when i wear it. i haven\\'t wear them out just to try them.  if it wasnt so baggy it woulf of been perfect. so, check the size chart . i recommend you just it the size you get in us. seriously. i\\'ve gained a few pounds over the past year and there isn\\'t much in my wardrobe i can wear anymore that makes me feel sleek and sexy. these pants do. they fit perfectly, and don\\'t readily show and unsightly underwear lines. they are light without being too slinky, but can keep you warm on a chilly day. they are also stretchy and rest very comfortably around the waist. i can\\'t reiterate enough how much i love these pants. after i\\'m done writing this review i may go and buy two more pairs. the only downside is, if you wear them two days in a row like i did (i treated them like pajamas and slept in them one night on accident), they will start to stretch and pull down. i don\\'t see this being a real problem because when i washed them they tightened right back up, and you wouldn\\'t normally wear them that long. i did notice something interesting, though it wasn\\'t a problem for me personally: on the inside part of the legs, the fabric may start to get slightly patchy, though not on the inside. it may have been because i washed it with some fluffy things, however. if anything changes, i will update my review, but at this moment i couldn\\'t be happier with them. these are incredibly comfortable! i\\'m 5\\'10\\\\\\\\\" and wear size 18 and these fit perfect! finding pants that are long enough and fit my legs and waist is near to impossible but these did the trick! i ordered them in size 18 and they were true to size. i love that they are stretchy and that i can wear them with boots, flats or heels. i received my order before the estimated delivery date and the price was great! highly recommend!<br /><br />fyi: they have belt loops. front pockets are fake but the back pockets are real. hope you enjoy them as much as i do! :) ordered both jack and pants ,they are just great! good product the pants look exactly as i expected and as advertised.  the price was also good for this type of pant. fit perfectly - got so many compliements on it. glad i made the purchase:) would more than likely recommend to friends & family. plan on making more purchases in the near future. ok... so it does a li\\'l cheap but i don\\'t care because i have bought worse things. the pants are definitely one of the most comfortable bottoms i have in my maternity wardrobe. the only downside i can see is that they are a little tighter around my hips, due to which i avoid wearing it with short tops. but again, as long as it is comfortable it is my favorite. literally one of the softest,  cutest sleepy outfits ever!  i am going to buy more for now, and for every size. i only leave reviews if something is terrible or amazing,  and this product is amazing!  a must have for your snuggley boo :) nice thin pants, they are not thick and very light weight made for dancer but i love the style and comfort of them. i hike me up to my knees and do yogi and go to the stir in my sandals and tee. meant for warmer climate. the pockets are nice addition, normally this thin a material don\\'t have pockets but this one does. i ordered 7 pairs of these pants for a senior ladies christmas tap dance program.  the ladies are assorted sizes.  the pants fit perfectly and they looked lovely.  lots of complements.<br /><br />well made product.  thank you we use these when we play paintball in the woods. they are pretty durable and don\\'t fade. they also blend in pretty good in drier areas due to the dull green color as opposed to the bright greens in regular bdus. love it!!!! these pants are quite comfortable!! they\\'re well fitted, the only thing...my legs are short so they drag. but it\\'s easy enough to fix! great for workouts or just wearing around the house! (they look good on too!) fits as expected they are soft and comfy to wear but the material is thin but for the price they are worth it great product!  arrived on time i have literally bought so many of these yoga pants. i love the fit! it can be worn as active wear or as \\'business\\' pants. i try to buy every so often because l am truly happy with these pants. it is actually really long for me, but no worries because l end up sewing it. great buy. great quality! my grand son loves them. i love the color and it fits good. the material is also good material. great for the money!  these are an awesome value. i purchased them for no-gi jiu jitsu because i was not willing to pay $50 plus for compression tights and $50 for a shirt from a name brand company, only to have them pulled, stretched, and roughed up on the mats.  these have held up really well to all the abuse they\\'ve received.  they run a tad small in my opinion because they are geared to smaller asian/european body types.  i\\'m 6\\' 1&#34; and 200 lbs with a 36&#34; waist and needed to order the xl set,  which fits me well.  the material is a bit thin (i.e. don\\'t wear them without underwear unless you\\'re looking for attention or laughs, ha!),  but they have held up to nearly a year of rough use during jiu jitsu with no holes or tears.  a few threads have come loose at the wrists and collar of the shirt,  but i have simply trimmed them from time to time and nothing has unraveled yet. i wear them three nights week for two hours of intense buy jitsu and wash them right after.  i\\'m definitely going to buy another set because this deal is too good to pass up imho! first off, the shipping was fast. it came really really fast, it\\'s really cute! my only problem is that one of the leg feels tighter than the other, it\\'s supposed to be one size yet my pants said l. but it still fits me nice. other than that i like it, and can\\'t wait to wear it. nice material but i thought by the pic it would have a thicker band at top or fold down..still cute though and warm! great quality.this is made very well. love them i will be buying more colors i have oredered these pants a few times. they are durable and i can always find my size in stock. wonderful choice. good fit. nice fabric. would buy again comfortable and very loose-fitting in the legs. i haven\\'t worn them much yet as we have been having temps over 100 here lately, but look forward to hiking and yoga in these pants. this is my 3 pair!!!<br />i have white & black and just ordered a new white.<br />love them!!!  i do wash them in a washing machine ( gentle cycle) rather then dry clean - no problem<br /><br />bough a jean pair in california and that one doesn t seem to fit as well( seems like it s too big) within days of ordering these....i ordered another pair.  great for exercise and i\\'ll be paddle boarding on vacation....great for this too.  the pair i have are reversible.  one side is black and the yellow a cute bright yellow.  love them! very comfortable and the pattern was nice choice to have for weekend running around without jeans. the legs are  a little long but with a small heal was fine. the only reason i can\\'t give it 5 stars is the wash. i washed it once and it looked like i had washed it a few times. these pants feel great, are breezy, and super cute and comfy to wear!  can be worn around the house, or out and about.  they\\'re a little thin, so if you wear them, you might want to wear something under them, but other than that, they\\'re fabulous! the fit was excellent on my mom (she will wear them xd !!!). i will order from macy\\'s for her in the future again!!! i love the way it looks on me! next i will have a photo. :-) soo comfy when it comes to yoga pants, why pay more? i love these roll-top cozies, they are my new &#34;study time staple&#34;. i plan on purchasing more soon! i got screams and hugs from my 13 year old for this purchase lol,,,i am mom of the year now ! my mom really likes these pants and wants some more. comfy pants, just could use less in length and a tad more give in the waist! love it everyday wear for me i love these pants.  they are flattering to my figure and i have received many compliments.  also, the pockets are deep and make it easy to carry small items. great product great bargin very cute, i wont go with elegant as the material is somewhat a &#34;jersey&#34; material..it casual-cute! can\\'t go wrong for the price. the snow pants are warm as i expected although they are a little large. fit great! i\\'ll buy them again so comfortable! shipping was fast! im 5\\'6&#34; size medium was perfect ‚ô° purchased for my daughter and she loves them. pants are sift to touch and fit perfectly great panties, made with great material.  they wash up very soft and they really work in time of &#34;emergency&#34;.  my daughter is very skinny in the waist, she is 3 and the 2t\\'s are a bit big, but she is small.  i would highly recommend these panties. perfect true to size and i am very curvy  fits my large thighs and gluts and small waist perfectly because of the stretch in the pants.  a true medium large these pants are great.  the bottom are not hemmed, but it doesn\\'t need it.  perfect for sandals to dress up or down.  great material. roomy in the thighs and stomach, not like most pants today.  i\\'m 5\\'1&#34; and had to roll the top over as the waist was a bit long. this is the cutest thing ever!  i\\'m 5\\'3 and 135 - post baby..still wanting to lose a few more but this fits great.  i can\\'t wait to wear it out!  i\\'m going to wear it to vegas and order a few more colors! this is a great hat. it very soft and stretchy. no itchy tags at all.  baby like to wear it too and it stays on. finally, some work shorts that fit! my husband is very happy! i love these leggings. they make me look skinner! super comfy and they cover my belly, everything great for someone that has extra belly fat from recently having a baby they have never let me down.<br /><br />the fit is consistent and the wear quality is excellent. not my style at all, but teen granddaughter  loves them. they are cute, a little small i thought. i bought these leggings and i love them. i wear a size 4-6 in jeans and i ordered a medium in these and they fit great. i lve that are are tight and are high wasted so the cover up my stomach and make it look smooth! i\\'ve always had issues with the fit of most scrub pants. most of them either don\\'t fit my hips properly, they bunch up at the crotch when i walk, or they\\'re too short and show my ankles. these pants are perfect. i spent a little more on these than i usually would but it\\'s definitely worth it. i\\'m a veterinary technician and i do more moving around than most people, and i depend on my pants to stay up and be comfortable whether i\\'m wrestling a dog or on my hands and knees cleaning a kennel. the pockets are awesome too. with the matching scrub top i look super polished and professional,  even when covered in fur. i bought these for someone who is confined to a wheelchair and needs a cut with a roomy abdominal area. we both liked this style, because the legs weren\\'t too slim or too baggy. i bought these as part of a rex kwon do halloween costume and i have worn them lounging around the house probably everyday since. they are super comfortable and they fit great. definitely recommended. these must be the softest ballet tights i\\'ve ever seen. i love the line down the back of the leg. the mesh material really fits well and snug without sagging. they don\\'t seem like they will be easy to rip or tear, or have runs in them for a long long while. very durable construction and i am very pleased with this purchase. these rock.  my man loves them.  they fit perfectly and he wears them all the time.  i think he wants another pair but i have to watch my pennies at this time of year!  we\\'ll see how good he is. great but way to long i bought these for my wife knowing she is 31&#34; in the waist and 41&#34; in the hips which put her dead center of the range for the large.  they fit perfectly and make her butt look fantastic.  she went on and on about how good they felt as well.  i can\\'t wait to see more variety from this product line. this is awesome it feels like i\\'m wearing nothing and it was here so fast it was my first order from amazon i think im gonna like this place my experience with this item:<br />very good quality snow pants. very warm, well made and comfy too. a fantastic buy for the price. nice looks good wife loved these. fit was perfect, as described. very comfortable i went back and ordered a pair in black. love these. great with ankle boots. so cool! great gift for harry potter fans. comfortable too. love these pants! have ordered more!! i love wearing my pants to work. i work in the field and on construction jobs. they are  not as tough as jeans but they are not wimpy pants either so they will last on the job. lots of the guys i work with like these pants. love these pants. comfy and stylish. the fabric is soft, and feels quite durable my favorite jeans. i bought two and adore them. recommend to everyone. recieved super quick and fit perfectly.  im a size 2 or 4 in most jeans depending on the brand, 5\\'2 and 120 lbs so i got a 5 to be safe, they fit great. a tad loose but the dryer fixed that. its worth the purchase! super comfy! wish there were more colors. xmas gift for son.... perfect size the pants fit perfectly and are so comfortable. i have a hard time buying pants since i\\'m short, but the fit is excellent, not too baggy and true to size. they also accentuate my legs and make my butt look fabulous! the fabric holds up well, too; it doesn\\'t bead up and never needs ironing. great buy! we bought these pants for my sons high adventure scouting trip and they quickly became his favorite pants both for scouting activities and non scouting activities.  lots of storage in pockets, light weight, quick drying, easy to unzip, great for just about anything. propper bdu\\'s are the best!  if you\\'re considering saving a few bucks buying cheeper stuff, don\\'t! you won\\'t save that much, and the quality difference is huge.  if you\\'re considering spending more on another brand, don\\'t.  why?  the quality of propper is second to none.<br /><br />word of advise.  buy a size smaller than what you\\'d expect.  i\\'m a big guy, and the first time i got propper, i thought i\\'d need a 2x.  i wear approx a 44\\' waist.  1x is perfect for me. these were a gift. my daughter is very happy with the pants. they are comfortable, fit well and still fit after washing. i bought these training pants for my 30-month-old daughter when we actively started potty training her.  she seems to be comofortable in them and likes wearing them.  she is a small 2-year-old though and fits into the 18 month size with ease.  i love the feel of the material and the fit, which is not too tight nor too loose.  i just bought three more so we have extras. love it good price went out to salsa and got so many compliments on these pants. i recommend them. they are nice but didn\\'t realize it was going to be a rubber plastic material. i\\'m not sure if i just didn\\'t read it but i\\'m sure that wasn\\'t written. i love the look and feel.  they could have been just a tad bit shorter as i am 5 foot, but love them anyway. love them! highly recommend i love these pants! so comfortable, i started dancing without evening thinking about it after putting them on. this of course made me laugh because their websites states &#34;pants that make you dance!&#34;. whether you are looking for a pant for yoga or something comfortable to wear around you will not be disappointed. their customer service was also 5 star. richard was extremely helpful and answered all my questions. if you are wondering what size to get i am 5\\' 1&#34; tall, usually wear a size 6 or 8 in women\\'s and i got a size small. for those of you that are yogis out there i am usually a small or medium in pants from my inner fire. i hope this helps! if you are wondering if you should buy these pants my answer is you should! like right now before they are gone! lol this is such a cute jumper! fits great. it is def perfect for a size small to an xl... a good \\'one size fits all\\'. super cute w peep toe booties and a cropped denim jacket...great for dress up or a nice casual look! these nue options pants are an amazing fit for anyone who is a little thicker around the hips, thighs, and butt than the average girl. if you have to go up a size for a pair of pants but then end up with a gaping waist, then these pants are for you! i\\'ve resorted to wearing skirts because i simply can\\'t make pants work. but these pants are not only a wonderful fit, they are slimming and i can actually wear my size! with the suspenders, he\\'ll grow into them. well worth the price. if you happen to like zubaz these were great and very prompt. fit well and feels so light and airy good value works as listed did not care much for the rubber/plastic harness pads. would like to see actual soft pads on this rig even as it stands i would recommend it to anyone having to haul equipment around all day great product, fast shipping!! we have a couple pairs and love them.  they are comfy, easy for my son to move about in, and wash well.  they are nice to wear around the house, or out when he needs something airy to cover his legs.  easy on and off for diaper changes, too. all good. i bought these yoga pants in the black with navy-grey foldover waist in a store last fall.  i love how they fit through the leg with a little bit of a flare at the bottom.  they don\\'t get stretched out at the knees even after a spin class.  i am 5\\'6\\\\\\\\\" and the length is perfect although i think they would still work for someone an inch or two taller/shorter.  but the thing i like best about these workout pants is that there is no visible elastic band indentation around the waist.  also, the foldover waist allows you to fold them down right where you feel comfortable (so they don\\'t end up looking either weird and high-waisted or too low).  anyway, i loved the ones i bought so much that i decided to try and find them online to buy another pair.  it was just a happy coincidence that these pants on amazon are the same exact ones.  i bought these here with the olive green waistband and they are equally great. the material was different then i thought. it is more like a cotton blend feel ...and dry clean, was not expected....other than that these a adorable.... all the items that i ordered were exactly what i wanted and they met my expectations. i am a very satisfied customer. thank you i sent them to my mother, who wears a medium and she loves them. the color was beautiful  and the design  lovely. old school kandy kid raver here (since 1996) and bought these for me and my wife for our disneyland vacation. package arrived quicker than expected and pants are exactly as pictured/described. they are comfortable and very light weight. drawstrings on the waist and bottom of the legs are perfect for keeping them up and off the floor. i bought these for my husband and he is very satisfied.  they are thin enough that he can wear them under suits for work, under jeans, etc., but they are quite warm. not too warm, not too cool.  just right.<br />its hot where i live so its hard to find leggings that don\\'t make you sweat.  these are perfect. wow! these pants are fabulous! i am known for dressing creatively (it\\'s self-expression for me.)<br />so i knew i had to have them! i love them! so much fun to accessorize!<br />and the comments! \\'what are you wearing!\\' \\'wow! those are great!\\'<br />ha! ha!<br />plus--they are soooo comfortable!<br />very happy, am i! use them to exercise and sweat a lot i am a big guy- who loves cargo pants. i am hard to fit as bigger than tall. i like hagar dual pocket- but they don\\'t make my size now. i have bought several but just do not have the size comfort level that i like. these pants-- 2 good cargo pockets and although not as soft as my old hagar&#34;s, better than others i have tried. the pocket openings a little small; also would recommend ordering 1 size larger than you think you will need. great pjs for kids. light, comfortable material. great design and colors. my grandson has few of these and he loves them. with this order, i also ordered five other outfits, no lie, this is my favorite. i actually bought it as a hang around kind of thing, but it is so cute, that i can actually wear it to an evening social event. its so cute and fits so sexy.. dress it up or down.. it\\'s a great piece to have.. very satisfied.. thanks.. these yoga pants are awesome and actually long enough! i\\'m 5\\'8&#34; about 150lbs, i got a medium and they fit perfect. the only down side is how much my cats hair sticks to it, but that\\'s to be expected with black pants.. they are definitely guys size and are a little too long but i like them.  they are comfortable and would definitely purchase another pair if they had them in a smaller size for my daughter. hubby went as lmfao and was a big hit. the costume is made well and fit him perfect. couldn\\'t have been happier. üëç these are good training pants. they allow the child to feel wet but limit the mess. i  would recommend them. perfect fit; i loved so much i purchased another pair, great for daily activities. fit is good.  ordered medium and they fit as expected.  waistband is elastic so i\\'ll have to see how long they last, but for the price they are perfect. bought the first one vs pink yoga pants in january. love them love them love them. yes, you have to be fit to show them off, or i should say , they will show your body. had tons of complements on them. use them with the matching bra not only for yoga, but zumba, strength and fit, pilates and gym. this was something i knew my person wanted for awhile. so having found that it was on amazon and the accurate timing for the package to arrive...yes all the yes\\'s. it was lovely and very comfortable for said person ;) material  is soft and stretching  where needed. very satisfied  with  this item very cute but not waterproof at all. great quality and not excessively baggy on my boys tiny bum. these pants are amazing and comfy!! i\\'m 5\\'5\\'\\' ~125lbs but more curvy thighs so i ordered a medium. you will not regret! my son loves these pants i ordered the black pair with a 32 waist. i was concerned they maybe too tight bc i prefer to wear a 33 waist w/ a belt, however the 32 waist fit great and were snug but not too tight. though slightly snug on waist/hips the pants wear more relaxed on the thighs/glutes/calfs and were long enough for length. overall the pants are a tinge snug, but they look slick and would be nice for a night out at the bar or maybe for a concert in the fall time. i am 6\\' foot and 160 pounds with an athletic/slender build. the black color is solid yet not too much. they look very nice and i am happy with the purchase. i bought this for my grandson as it gets cold here in the winter, the size was perfect and they kept him nice and warm my daughter is going to love these when she gets them on friday for her birthday. i want to give a huge thanks to tj prodigy for telling us about y\\'all. i will for sure be buying more stuff from y\\'all. i bought other yoga pants at the same time (doubliju) and these are are well worth the little bit extra in price, right now they\\'re my favorite. they\\'re thick enough to not be see thru when bending over and are just the right length when i\\'m wearing shoes (i\\'m 5\\'3). i like that the fold over is a different color than the pants and i\\'ll be buying more of these as i start doing more yoga and working out. quality exceeded expectations! i was so hesitant to order these pants but absolutely love them and always get so many compliments. they look so good for the price. they look great with boots or heels. i have had them for about 8 months now and they still look great.  a must buy! fits i have these in size small. back when i wore a larger size, these were the pants i always threw on. the sizing of these pants are large for designer pants; if one is a(n) cone/apple (as in one is larger on the top than bottom) or an hourglass, one should size down (though this isn\\'t true for the hoodies, see my review about it, if one wants more details), but the pants are very long (even though i\\'m pretty tall). the quality was decent, considering they\\'re made in the usa (one of the best recently made us apparel i\\'ve seen) and the fit was nice. i wouldn\\'t recommend these for the very thin, mattering on one\\'s body type, because one might get swallowed up in these pants. nice comfy design. good material for the price.<br />loved it!!<br />i was wearing it almost every day till it got too hot. finally a pair of pants that i love to wear because they are long enough! yes, stretch to fit my curves, length to look good with all of my shoes, and washes and wears beautifully. i love the color brown and use them with all of the tan, cream and warm tinted clothing that i have. i would wash them on delicate because they will last longer, and they have become my favorite. i am a size 14 and they are slenderizing without having to be uncomfortable. perfect fit..love them perfect! item arrived timely and as described. love the fit of these pants, comfortable, since &#34;stretchy&#34; always fits to me. like slim look. also, appreciate having back pockets. i lived in this all summer. every one wanted to know where i got it. very cute and it fits. i wear xs usually and this fit me just right. the shipping took long howevrr but thats understandable i bought these pants to wear to work at a school and i love them! they fit well and the material isn\\'t too hot. the only draw back is that they are a little clingy on my &#34;pouch&#34; but they still look okay. i loved it so beutyful.¬§]$ is the best i loved you lovet to nice these pants are good quality, look nice, and are very flattering.  hand wash only, so that\\'s disappointing.  suitable for practice or performance. i am 5\\'2. 130 pounds and these pants fit awesome. they are a little long, but most all pants are on me! these really feel like i am wearing some super expensive name-brand! i am ordering more! got this pair to test out for my wife and she loves them so i got two more they take me back with the wide leg style. not to bad price. lightweight material for the summer. i got a lot of compliments on the the color and style. the only drawback is the waistband. it\\'s a little loose. sizes are correct.  material is thick and soft.  wonderful fit for my 2+ yr old.  glad i found them on amazon! i have ordered several different brands and styles of yoga pants and these by far are my favorite.<br /><br />pros:<br /><br />fabric is thick enough to stand up to wear (and not show those...lets just say \\\\\\\\\"imperfections\\\\\\\\\" some of us live with daily) but not so thick as to be too hot.<br />fold over top has internal seams so that if you wear it up (rather than folded over) there are no raw edges or seams.<br />rich colors<br /><br />cons:<br /><br />would love more color choices great fit and comfy. thin material but still really cute and comfortable. super comfy, great quality. i am 5\\'4\\'\\' 130 lbs 36\\'\\' hips and 28\\'\\' waist and i ordered a small. these make your but look great. the length is perfect for me but on the brink of being too long if i were any shorter. the olive green is a great color. the fit, material & its bright colors are very good. waist has smooth elastic, the whole texture is very smooth. the colors look brighter & lively than its online pictures. the pants don\\'t come off the feet like other brands and this is good for the crawling babies. i very much recommend these. great service as well. take five super fix love! they look pretty good :) these are comfy. they will shrink in the wash, but they were a little too long at first, so that was ok. my model liked them it is necessary that i return this item.  the description stated to pick the next larger size, which i did.  however, i found it still did not fit properly; thus my having to return it.  it is very nice and i\\'m sorry i cannot keep it. great pants....want another pair. greatest investment, especially if you regularly go to the gym and want to burn body fat. in two weeks of wearing them for my spinning classes and other workouts i was asked how much weight i\\'d lost because i appeared to have lost a lot. i feel it but prefer not to weigh.    i believe they might affect cellulite too. my legs were commented on at a sportswear party. one feels very supported in them....and i love em! these pants are awesome! they fit perfectly, they\\'re probably the most comfortable pants i own now, they were very reasonably priced, and they shipped out fast. they\\'re a bit of an odd material, but they pair well with regular t-shirts as well as oversized shirts and tunics. comfortable, warm and easy to care for good product, and nice fast delivery. nice pants!  bought for my daughter  who is 5\\'6&#34; and would usually wear a sz. l.  (sometimes xl). they wash well and are line dried. ironing is not necessary. length is good, maybe a little long for her. they fit well and are very comfy.  she loves these pants! absolutely adorable and perfect for hot 100+ degree days where i live - these pants are super breezy and don\\'t cling to your skin at all even when wet/sweaty. i am 5\\'4, 120 lbs, normally wearing size small/2 in pants with 31&#34; inseam; these fit great with plenty of room (but don\\'t look saggy at all!) - these would definitely fit and compliment many different body shapes and sizes. i like to fold the elastic part under - the elastic is not at all uncomfortable or constrictive, totally amazing for hot weather. the colors are very bright and true to the picture, the pattern gorgeous, very detailed and colorful. i love the cute side pocket. will be ordering more of these amazing and unbelievably comfortable pants!!! it is really hard to find denim cargo pants at a decent price. when i first ordered them, i was worried that there was only one size option. no 30 x 30. just 30. they fit great though i needed a 30x30. this is an ideal pajama because its long sleeve and pants to keep baby warm, but the fabric is lightweight enough that your baby doesn\\'t get too hot. and wow are they soft and comfortable.<br /><br />just know that these are slim fit, and therefore run a little small. our 16 month old is wearing the 18-24 size, and they are still snug. i was skeptical, but the pants look great and are super comfortable!  they accentuate nicely.  i did order a size up per the other reviews and they worked out great, the baby bodysuit and pants are for my not yet born great granddaughter. i believe she will look lovely in this outfit!! i\\'m a leggings type of girl all day long! these are comfortable and the color is popping!  can\\'t wait to jump in these! i recommend ordering a larger size and wearing a thin pair of leggings underneath (a dark color) because the material is thin....to avoid seeing through them, double up using a thinner legging and you\\'ll be alright! works every time for me! soft and well made.  i like them a lot.  like a skirt but pants and good for casual and can be dressed up. quality is very good even if not genuine us military bdu\\'s.  the true military versions do not zip off into shorts but thats what makes them better. my grandmother loves and it doesn\\'t look as dull in person! a bit long but can hem easily. very flattering! love fit perfectly! very comfortable on the belly. i can do lots of stretching and bending without exposing my tummy - even when i am upside down.<br /><br />love these pants! i love these leggings. i was worried if they would fit bc i\\'m 5\\'9 but they fit. i also got a really long black shirt to match. would definitely recommend they were perfect, the girls loved them. these pants fit perfectly! i ordered a size 9 (my hips are 38\\\\\\\\\" and i weigh 130-140 pounds). i wasn\\'t expecting them to fit so well, since my legs are fairly muscular (what can i say? i love running). they\\'re very soft, and quite stretchy, so much so that i can exercise in them without problems (including yoga). as a plus, they feel quite durable and fairly decently built, so i expect them to last for a while.   the only bad thing about these pants is that cat hair does stick to them, so be warned if you have a cat who likes to sit on your lap. mine came in on time and as ordered with the empire symbol which was a worry of mine ordering this product. they fit perfect for me and i didn\\'t even have to untie them. the material printed on them seems well done to where it won\\'t be washed off. they aren\\'t thick and don\\'t have fuzzy sweats like material they are just very comfy lounge pants and came in black. perfect for any sith lord very comfortable and can keep legs cool while doing yoga! true to size, very comfortable and cute fits well my son wore these for several months straight, he wore them almost everyday..he didn\\'t like me to take them off, it\\'s like he knew that they were padded and more comfortable than his other clothes.  i recommend them very much. it fits perfect.<br />i\\'m 99lbs and 5\\'0 tall i ordered xs. the top fits perfect and the bottom i always have to cut but that\\'s normal for me i always have to re size my pants.. love! love the kp brand, but learning everything runs small. fit is just what i expected (well, hoped for!).  pants are soft and comfortable.  will definitely be ordering more of these. i did buy a size up and will enjoy wearing these white pants.  usually white is not something i would choose, but the fit was very comfy. again 5 stars. 5\\'4 135 pounds. size large fits snug but perfect. love handles don\\'t stick out, lol! soft fabric is comfy and delivery was on time. thanks again. love the spacious pockets i just love these pants; they are very flattering, fabulously comfortable, airy, light and fun. i have them in every color and my only complaint is they don\\'t have more colors; especially pastels; pale blue, light pink, sage green, lilac and so on. i highly recommend them. i didn\\'t listen to all the reviews saying these ran small.  they do, but not significant enough that my regular size didn\\'t fit.  shipping took forever and a day, but nice well made pants. really comfortable, just sorta big on me, but still comfy great addition! love the way these fit. very comfortable. great sweat love the way these fit! i recently ordered these blue pants- i like these pants for my baby;really nice, beautiful pants and very lightweigh so my baby doesn\\'t get too hot fantastic fit. they look amazing on....very sexy indeed. i highly recommend them. i\\'m 5\\' 9&#34; 135 pounds. size small was chosen for me, and it was the right choice. these are great durable pants at a awesome price. perfect for protection against every day outdoor elements. i use these in the winter time for riding my bike to school or running the dog. i have expensive go-lite goretex pants and i use these just as much and they are great. tops are about the right size, a little big, but the bottoms are way too big. super cute, wears well, soft fabric. order down! the item is of very good quality - it was shipped in a timely manner - recipient very happy - would purchase from them again anytime they do raise some eye brows- due to their unique look.  too bad they do not have more options avaiable perect i love it it\\'s great the material is nice the design is very beautiful and it is definitely sexy fits well and is comfortable. it also absorbs sweat very well. sizing can be a problem, so choose your fit carefully. love the pants i will recommend it they are awesome!  i really love them. they fit great.... i miss having real pockets for my phone but i love these tights so much i don\\'t care lol what had happened was, i sent my aunt too much candy and she grew. i bought her some pants to compensate and she said that they fit perfectly. this item would be perfect if you made it in dark brown instead of black, and got rid of the dotted lines and kept the solid blue lines. you\\'d sell so many! please make one like that!!! this brand of leggings is great. fix is perfect and fabric is not see though. comfy as can be. price is great. i bought these for my teenaged son who wanted some pants freedom.  they are comfortable and he enjoys them, but i think his friends did not appreciate them so he only lounges in them.  alas, he was born in the wrong decade!! love these onsies!  super-soft, hold up well to repeated washing, lots of colors. we have had both the long-sleeved & short-sleeved versions. i love the pants!!! i got them in two days exactly just like i was promised! i love them they make me wanna say yasssssssssss! i have a pair of these pants and love them! they are most comfortable and love that they fit just below the waist. searching for more pairs have the dk grey ones, hoping for another color but $48.00? that is a bit pricy, i didnt pay half that for the pair i have. not finding them in stores, is that why the high price? must be some somewhere else that are priced more reasonably... the sizing runs large.  i ordered a 1x which usually i am true to size, but, this needed to be altered 4 inches in length, then taken up in the waist because the crotch was too low, another 5 inches.  i am 5 feet 4 inches tall and wear a 3 inch heel shoe with this garment that i so love.  thank you! very soft and comfortable to wear. just what i wanted to complete my victorian gear. this is my second one, love it nice! exellent,everything its good.describe good,quality good.i can say only exellent about everything.i would like recomanding this product bat also this store everybody.thanks. very comfortable, soft, good fabrics, perfect sizing. the word &#34;navy&#34; is written in a way that it doesn\\'t wash of easily. doesn\\'t look cheap.<br />only i wish there were some pockets.<br /><br />go navy! seriously, these yoga pants are hot! they are comfortable and sexy!  what more can a girl ask for. distinctive salt-and-pepper look and warmth of robust, 12.5-oz. pure wool donegal tweed. includes full lining for a comfortable fit, along with faux-leather trim on the side-seam pockets and button-through back pockets. plain front. 100% wool, with 65% polyester/35% cotton lining.<br />i wear it in very cold weather and it gives me the warmth that i have been looking for. buy it with confidence. i really loved it size fits me perfect strips are well stitched at perfect spots it gives baggy look with strips n picture looks different but its baggy the way i wanted it and looks great lovely really liked it . \\\\\\\\\"these are not jeans!\\\\\\\\\" i said to my boss as he looked at me accusingly last casual friday.    \\\\\\\\\"i don\\'t care what they are, you still can\\'t wear them,\\\\\\\\\" he replied.     wham pow! flying roundhouse kick to his stupid face! i originally bought these to wear as long johns under my street clothes. i will use them for that. however i wear them around the house. i love the way hold my package. i feel free like i\\'m not wearing anything at all. i plan on ordering 2 more pairs. the pants are very nice and of a good quality. i liked the way they looked on me and they fit very well. i will defintely be buying items from this seller again. very comfortable and still holding up well after 4 months.  would buy again.  sharon the waist was a little tight but fit ok. i prefer the zumba trademark pants as they are loose on the waist to help move! if you want a discount on zumba wear try to use affiliate code 87412. it works on all clothing, accessories and even works on sales items!! its awesome!! satisfied this belly dance costume is very sexy,and fitt was porfect.<br />im 5,4&#34;tall and i weigt 128 1b<br />seller was wery fast,and i love my costume.<br />thank you bought this at target since it was on sale (same price listed here $25).  what a great buy! the fit was perfect and it kept me cool throughout my 2hr cardio workout! wish they had it in other colors, i would stock up! (ps- unlike other pants, these actually kept thier shape after the workout too, a plus!) i love the leggings they are very confortable and they fit perfect. they are great with high hills and your butt looks bigger haha look good and is not to short from the back and it dose comes with the belt they go with a variety of tops and shoes. i have gotten a lot of complements on them. they fit nicely and are stretchy and soft. i am glad i purchased them! this was one of our new grandson\\'s christmas gifts and it was very high quality, so soft and ran well! we got the red plaid moose , so cute! it arrived very quickly! they look great, feel great and have a beautiful design.  they are great for casual wear and lounging. a great buy. there were some problems with my order......but as soon as we figured it all out they were very prompt about solving the problem! thank you....i love the belly dance/workout attire....i am going to send all my students your way!!! they were somewhat small. i really like these, but it\\'s hard to match with the camo. i think i\\'m going to buy a dark blue pair or a dark green next because i really like how they feel and fit. i\\'m 5\\'6\\\\\\\\\" 130 lbs with an average body type. i\\'m thin, but could lose an inch or two from around the waist. this is probably why they are a bit snug around my waist, but perfect everywhere else. i wear a 4/5 usually. also, for those of you wondering if you should get the next size up, there are ties on the inside of the pant for the waist, which is super helpful and a great addition to this pant. i don\\'t think getting a large would have been a good choice for me. i don\\'t need to wear a belt with them, which is great. overall, a really great boyish cargo. it\\'s baggy, but is still nice and tight around the butt :d. they look super cute with chucks! hope this helps! these fit rather small and are definitely more of a diaper cover than a short. i ordered a 6-12 month size for my chubby 3 month old and they are pretty tight. but as with all kicky pants brand they are a very cute color and the bamboo fabric is awesome. love there style. highly recommend if you like a different style of clothes. they do not sell in stores i checked and could not find. price is great. these pants are very comfy and great fit around my pregnant belly. the only reason it doesnt get 5 stars is bc they are a bit short and a little more flared then what i expected so comfy love it! thank you so much! very thin material, but expected this after reading reviews.  i wanted thin because it is getting hotter and i wanted something thin to go under a white dress.  i\\'d go a size smaller, i really had to sinch mine up so they wouldn\\'t fall down. love my pants. its a different look. want some more. will order some more soon.<br />new patterns here i come these pants are the sexiest pair of pants i\\'ve ever seen on my wife! they\\'re stretchy, which is good because they run a smidge small. i ordered her a pair of large and xl. both fit but the large might be too small after washing. in a weird these pants are awesome! love them good for lazy days that u want to be cute. great product just ordered it one size to big other then that no complaint. lightweight, waterproof, tough = i\\'ll buy it again!!!! great leggings for the price! great material. fits as described. a bit large compared against my normal size for jeans but then the material is very stretchy.<br />i would definitely recommend this peoduct and i\\'m getting another pair in a size smaller. comfy lounge pants! i ordered these pants to spread some freedom, and to show all commies that old glory is the greatest most free flag pants around<br /><br />murica!!! very cute, unique and well made.  didn\\'t shrink after washing but i did hang them up to dry. comfiest pants ever! i ordered medium which is what i originally wear an fit perfectly. will buy again! these fit well and the high waist option is very good. they are long enough for 5\\'81/2&#34; height. the material is comfortable and easy to wash and dry. the only thing i\\'d add, is that while the material is soft and comfortable, after only two or three washings (even washed inside out) start feel/look s/w worn and not as fresh.. perfect fit, sturdy stitching, and fast color. these do not run as small as expected. get your normal size if in america.  i have washed these several times and do not see signs of fading or wearing! they do not make my skin itch as similar products have. i have very sensitive skin. comfortable enough to be pajamas, but the fabric and fit is perfect for sportive activities. stretchy waistband, 2 pockets, not too baggy at the bottom but doesn\\'t pinch either. aside from wearing these to embarrass my gf, i like to dance/bboy in these, they\\'re great practice/powermove pants! the design is quite &#34;loud.&#34; you will be noticed (in the best way) when wearing them outside. my granddaughter raves about these pants. she loves the look and the fit. most of all, she loves the comfort. the tropical-cool gauze fabric is a boon someone living and working in the summer in the deep south. in love with it adorable! fit perfect my mistake was that i didn\\'t measure my waist and height, ended up had to go to the tailor and alter it a bit.<br /><br />has been a while since i wore cargo pants, just loving it so much great pants, fit perfect, made well. these are comfortable, but don\\'t plan on bending over while wearing them, everyone will definitely get a nice glance at your undies. i\\'m 5\\'1&#34; and these are pretty long on me, but that\\'s not unexpected. i love it! this is a men\\'s shirt, and i am a girl, so the small fit perfect. it is brighter in color then the photo leads you to believe, but to me that was a plus. i wore this like a dork to go see the new movie, and i got so many compliments on it. they are pretty thin but they are exactly as expected. in my photo the leggings look a bit dirty in the mirror picture but thats only my mirror, they\\'re not actually dirty these pants fit well and and are durable to everyday use. i would recommend this item to anyone that is looking for a good quality pants to wear causally. i have to admit, i wasn\\'t sure what these were going to look like on my son but i was pleasantly surprised. they are adorable. so adorable i bought a second pair and my baby couldn\\'t be happier. delivered ahead of time and with a little added gift for my son was also a huge surprise. your customer service is over the top! thank you kindly!!! i only buy organic clothes for my baby so i was excited to see these darling little pants. and, they deliver on the cuteness. however, they\\'re not very soft in my opinion. perhaps that will change with some washings?     also, i went to their website to check the appropriate size to buy. my baby is on the high end of the size i selected, so i thought for sure they\\'d fit great. however, they\\'re actually still quite large. very comfortable and good quality. the waist band is very flattering and can be worn up or folded over. very flattering and better than other yoga pants seen in stores. size fits as expected.<br />p.s. if you\\'re a bigger girl, don\\'t try to get a smaller size thinking it will stretch to your body; or else it will look a bit see through. this  romper is super comfortable and looks great!  i received alot of compliments on this puppy.  it is a very flattering design.  the quality of the material is very nice.  i would not mind having them in every color! these pants actually turned out very cute. i really like the design and the color. they do run a little big, and they stretch out. you might consider buying these one size smaller? it just depends on how tight you like to wear your clothes. these pants were very comfortable.  the material felt like a wonderful broken in t-shirt.  for me, they seemed like a perfect pajama or lounge pant, but i wanted something with more support and compression for yoga.  just depends what you want- i did return them,but not due to any quality or fit issues. they came in just like they looked and on time they also fit perfectly and look super amazing i recommend these for shure!! soooo happy i got these. totally worth it. i\\'m a size 27 in denim and a s fits perfect. looks very classy with a white or black rank and sandals. these are super sexy and fit great i bought these in the dark grey color and the material is super soft and comfortable, but for a dark color they\\'re surprisingly see-through in the bum. will just have to make sure to wear dark or nude solid colored panties underneath. otherwise the style is cute, the fit is good- even the length, and i look forward to lounging around in them. fyi i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; and 130 lbs. i really liked it, it worked great for a temporary fix!  definitely worth it to get me through a uses! i\\'m 5\\'6\\'\\' and 135lbs. i ordered size s and it fits ok. i have heavier lover body so that\\'s why decided to use them. they get their job done. the minute i put them on i am sweating like crazy! yes they do smell and make weird noise but the only thing i care about are the results. to avoid all of that &#34;discomfort&#34; i just put regular leggings on them and go the the gym. but to be honest with you no one cares about what pants you wear. had them for about 2 wks and wear them every time i got the the gym which is 5-6 times a week. i wash them every day with my other gym clothes and dry them in dryer. she loves them. definitely going to enjoy wearing these to work. fit perfect and so comfortable. thank you! the pants themselves are beautiful & very comfortable. only problem is the extra large is about a large. other than that, no complaints. these are fantastic. the fabric is thicker, so it should hold up longer. i love wearing dresses over pants - and these fit both bills. these will probably become my new uniform. am ordering more! bought them. they\\'re what you expect for the price. people are correct, the design is blurred but when you wear them, honestly, it doesn\\'t really matter. size wise (as someone who wears a size 6-7 bottoms and 5\\'5&#34;) they were a good fit length yet they sat a bit bellow my hip. also, they aren\\'t as soft or velvet looking in the picture. it\\'s like the image is digitally printed onto the leggings as well as the texture which is odd, but i guess it works????????????<br />overal, considering the price, it was a decent buy. these lounging pants are the most comfortable pants i own. they are light weight so it almost feels like wearing nothing. the wide elastic waistband rides gently on the waist. it does not bind at all but holds the pants up appropriately.<br /><br />the only critique i would mention is that they do shrink so follow the washing guidelines closely.<br /><br />after a few weeks of wearing this one pair, i ordered 3 more pair. i am from buffalo new york and we just had 6 feet of snow in 48 hrs last month....boy could i have used these pants then. i wanted something waterproof to wear over one or two pair of sweatpants. i tried these on over a thick pair of velour pants and they fit great. the are roomy enough to wear two lighter pair of sweatpairs or velour pants. i am125 pounds and 5 ft nine, my waist is about 26 inches. the are long enough too. these would probably be too long for someone shorter but you can always cut them or sew them up seeing they are not crazy expensive. pockets are open to allow you to reach into your real pockets. i purchased these for my teenager and she loves them.  wears them all of the time.  even wears them when she runs. these fit pretty nice but are thinner than i expected. i don\\'t know how well they\\'d be for serious winter temps. we\\'ll find out. otherwise, they worked well as a base layer in fall temps. i didn\\'t get too hot or too cold i love these pants! these are the first pair of maternity pants that haven\\'t fallen off of me all day, stretched or sagged. i got these in the mail yesterday and was very worried about ordering them sight unseen, but these were worth it. i haven\\'t once had to readjust or yank the belly band back up, they fit right all day. i\\'m only 18 weeks and not that big yet, just too big for normal clothing, so other maternity pants haven\\'t been helpful or fit well at all, but these pants are just right and i\\'m hopefull that my growing belly will wear well with these too, plus they are very cute and stylish! very cute designs on pants, good material, sizing runs a little small. i love the look and feel of these pants. they just about scream awesome! the only thing i do not like is how long they are. i wish tripp would come in petite or &#34;short people\\'s&#34; size. lol. i\\'m 5\\'3 and i\\'m literally trippin\\' over them. the look is spectacular i\\'m a plus size 2x girl and the fit is great. i love the fabric used its comfortable and breezy perfect fit :) these were bought as a gift my our niece, she liked them a lot and thought they were a good quality. good quality, the fit is true to the age, soft and durable.  the colors go with so many tops/onesies you can\\'t go wrong!  would recommend:) great love it - i have two of them.  seem to keep me room temperature and so durable.  great investment. perfect fin an no see-through i have to say i\\'ve order many yoga/spandex pants in the past and these are great quality comfortable pants and by far the best price for the quality of pants.  i ordered the small charcoal and i am 5\\'3&#34; 118 pounds.  i only like the solid colors so i am hoping in the near future they come out with some solids.  monique s. i am not sure the laces are long enough but they look great on! i\\'m a fan of the old army pt uniform, so these are a close match.  they came on the expected date, and i also ordered a matching sweatshirt.  both fit perfect and the material is super cozy.  my husband even wanted a pair after seeing mine.  only complaint is that the lettering seems to crack after only a few washed. love these! i am 5\\'2\\\\\\\\\" and wear about a size 10 pants (i ordered large). i recently had my second child and have all sorts of lumps and bumps in new places... getting back in shape has been a challenge, especially when all of the yoga pants give me muffin top and make me self-conscious. these don\\'t do that at all!  i ordered large because i wanted my pants to forgive.  i could have ordered medium - for my current size, i would say i\\'m between the medium and large size.  they\\'re stretchy and soft, don\\'t pinch, don\\'t give muffin top. you can fold down or pull them up for a little more support in the abs region.  despite the high price, i am ordering four more pairs.  thumbs up! since i haven\\'t bought these, it is hard to be sure, but i am pretty sure you could squat tyranny in those bad boys. these pants were very nice. they are good quality and flare at the bottom. the waist fits very small so order a size up!!! i\\'m usually a size 1 waist and it was too tight for me in a small pants delivered quickly and fit perfect. have washed them 2 times without any size changes. look great on definatly buying more in other colors. very soft, very stretchy.  love it!! color is right on as shown in pic. this is very comfortable and versatile short. i wear this under my dress for dancing. i am going to buy another pair in other colors! these are super soft and comfortable.  i notices after a couple wears they began to pill a bit.  it is not noticeable unless you touch them.  otherwise, they feel like sweats but look like thick tights. i\\'m 5\\'7  140lb and they easily reach to almost half my thigh. stretchy, so if you have curvy thighs then they will fit just fine with room to spare. i bought these to cover under some dresses/skirts i\\'m getting and  they\\'re great. not too see-through either. perfect. very cute. saving for christmas, haven\\'t worn yet my son loves them so much i have a hard time getting them off to wash them.  i\\'m thinking of getting a pair of my own. we\\'ve just purchased our third pair of these pants - because we like them so well & our boys keep growing!  my 6 year-old likes these better than the regular pants type; he says the bibs are a lot easier to put on.  my 3 year-old can put these on himself.  i like that cool air and water doesn\\'t get up under the jacket very easily.  plus, on a warmer day, they can take off a jacket and still be fairly well protected.  my kids stay dry and can play outside in any weather.  they are fairly sturdy, and my #2 son still stays dry in the pants originally bought for his older brother.  i only wish they had a reflective stripe on the legs, these are incredibly soft and i love wearing them. a few things that kept me from giving 5 stars:<br />  these bleed color - a lot of it - when hand washing in cold water. i haven\\'t gotten caught in the rain in these but i would be worried about having green skin and also staining any fabric (furniture, seat in car) if i were to get them wet while wearing. i soaked them in fabric softener infused water over night as recommended to help set the color. i rinsed them thoroughly until water seemed to run clear. the second time i hand washed them, they bled again. i may try soaking them in salt water -also recommended to help &#34;set &#34; the color.<br />  also, these had a weird smell when i first opened the package - kind of a wet canvas smell. it was not noticeable at all after the initial soak and wash - much to my relief!<br />  i am 5\\'6\\'\\' and wear women\\'s l or xl. the description makes them sound like they would be comfortable for larger sizes than i wear but i don\\'t think they would be. they are comfy for me but if i was a size larger, the elastic waist would feel tight . also, they are not very long. they are a bit short on me as pants but i like to wear them with the leg cuffs just below my knee. this could be worn as a jumper also but there is no string to tie around neck. it stays up fine without it and one could be added easily enough.<br />  despite these issues, they are my favorite clothing item to wear. the fabric feels amazing on my skin and they are super cute. i will be ordering in other colors. i just hope it doesn\\'t rain! my favorite pants! i give these 4  stars only because the material is not cotton so it seems like it would get itchy during the warm month. but they are super cute and i liked the price i got them for. these work well for assisting my daughter in knowing when she\\'s peed, something she never registered in pull-ups/diapers. they are so absorbant, they take forever to dry in the dryer ... which, i suppose, is a good thing in training underwear. she sometimes has a hard time pulling them up herself but, as she won\\'t be wearing them when i\\'m not around, this isn\\'t as big of a deal for me. i recently purchased two pairs of these pants for a yoga retreat. i received many compliments due to the beautiful sun and moon designs. i would highly recommend them! i really love these color is good fits nice and love the feel of them i really like these jeans, however, the feel is more like velvet rather than denim. really nice pants though. also they are ripped jeans. i would definitely buy these jeans again. the only reason i put 4 stars is because of the material. in the picture it looked like denim but it\\'s actually velvet. first time i\\'ve ever bought a ufo product. i purchased the pants friday and knowing that delivery wouldn\\'t take process till the work week began. i was expecting thursday but they arrived tuesday, in a more or less proper delivery package. i wan expecting a more... cotton material for the pants to be made of. due to my own ignorance i miss read the info that said it was more polyester than cotton. so yeah, but i was still satisfied with what i got. only problem for me is on receiving i notice a black-ish mark on the pant. its not a powered but like a burn or ink mark instead. other than that, the pants are comfortable,if my size well(s-small waist 30-32), i wouldn\\'t recommend wearing them in hot and or humid wear due to the material they\\'re made of. but for \\\\\\\\\"day to day\\\\\\\\\" wear would be ok as well as \\\\\\\\\"party wear\\\\\\\\\". would i purchase any other ufo product? yes, i\\'d just read the info about them more carefully. great pair of pants. i wear jeans size 12/14, thought i should get large but listened to the previous reviews and went with the medium..perfect. they fit like capris in the length and fit tight enough to feel them, without busting out. i have worn them to softball practice and several workouts on the elliptical machine and yes...there is sweat. yes there is some odor and there is noise...but what do you expect you are basically wearing rubber right? i would recommend this product.  i think some of my sisters will be purchasing for this year\\'s race for the cure also.  they fit nice and were fun. i\\'m so happy that i bought these jeans. they are extremely comfortable, and i wear them at least twice a week. they look like skinny jeans, but feel like sweatpants. they look great with my heels and boots. they looked small when i took them out but they are surprisingly very stretchy and super comfortable.  material is also pretty thin.  i wore them in the spring and was very comfortable. the pants were exactly what i expected regarding size, fit, and quality. would order again! love the length! cozy, just like what we wanted i actually buy the sweats for me since i can wear the xl\\'s in boys...i\\'m kind of of a small guy.  anyway, i\\'ve done everything in them and they\\'ve been washed at least 30 times and they just don\\'t wear out.  i think it\\'s the polyester in them.  and don\\'t let that freak you out if you think 100% cotton is the only way to go.  these sweats are so soft and the price is incredible.  compare the price of sweat pants at any discount store and compare the quality.  with lands\\' end return policy...nothing can compare, i swear! works great it\\'s true these pants have a slight shine to them but not too much. i\\'m 5\\'3&#34;  and 130lbs and the size 5 fit perfectly. they are very stretchy and figure flattering. the only problem i have with them is they are just slightly long which is better than i expected. i wore them with a half inch wedge and they were perfect. i probably will have them hemmed because i\\'d like to wear them with flats like in the model picture. they were a little short on my 4-year-old granddaughter; she also has very long legs. comfortable, nice drape in the fabric. only complaint is that i wish there were pockets. :-) the pants are fine, decent quality, but i am between a 10 and a 12, so i tend to go larger - i should not have with this product.  that\\'s the only issue. love love love these.  so chic and different.  wore these with a halter and linen shirt over it. wonderful, great, supurbe, feel to the material. i love them, but... the white pants are uber thin, you can see right through them. you will need to  wear granny panties and a shirt that covers your hind end. i mean they are really thin. also, i\\'m 53&#34; and with flat sandals i have to hem them about 1.5 inches. i bought the black pair too. the above is true for the black pants also, except that they are dark so you can\\'t see your panties through them.<br /><br />the fit was great for a small, but i can\\'t wear the waist band, not turned down. if i wear them as high waisted pants the top of the band is too big. if the butt was any larger,  i would have to return them and get an xs if they offered that size.<br /><br />again... over all, i\\'m buying more!<br /><br />i am going to order a few more pair in different colors. no doubt about it, these are very comfortable. i am 5\\'6&#34; and about 165 pounds and the large is a bit too big for me. but they stay up, nice elastic waistband. length is a bit long but not outlandishly so. cute design. i also bought these in blue polka dots and i like those more just because i prefer that pattern.<br /><br />great for the price, very soft, washes well, recommend! i bought these pants about a week ago , and these pants came in really fast ! üôå i read about the other reviewers saying that the run small , so i took their opinion to concederation and it\\'s true , so i got a large and they fit perfectly ! i\\'m really loving these pants love these, good quality i love jeggings and these are no exception. these are very soft although the material isn\\'t the best it is very light. if you like wearing thin pants or jeggings these are very comfortable. great fit. inseam is a little short for a person 5\\' 6&#34; when i first opened the package, i was worried they looked a little short, but they ended up fitting perfectly. i\\'m 5\\'8&#34; 165 lbs. and chose the medium. the extra space in the pouch is beyond flattering, and the material is super soft. i like the higher quality of n2n products, and the fact they\\'re made in the usa is a cool bonus. it came right on time, nice pants, great design but my only thing is that the bottom of the legs don\\'t look like they do in the picture. but its ok i still love them. thank you!! soft and cute adventure time rocks love the show.<br />wish had more lumpy space princess stuff, plus write her in to the show more worked great for the play my son was in at school. these are adorable little sweat pants that our fast growing granddaughter got to wear awhile. what a great item! i got compliments all. night. long. they make the butt look killer, shows off the leg muscle (i wore them for a themed dinner), and just the right length for me at 5\\'8. i am a size 6, and got the large to be on the safe side. it was a very smart move as others have suggested. they fit like a glove :) these pants are very nice quality.  the length runs a little longer than stated.  recommended for any man wanting a nice pair of pants that are not overly dressy. love these and can\\'t wait to wear them!  the fit is great and they are plenty long (i\\'m 5\\'8&#34;).  well made and very comfortable with nice full flowing legs.  these can be dressed up or worn for casual occasions.  as pictured and color is very vibrant.  i bought these in two different prints and i love both.  shipped and arrived quickly.  highly recommend these and i will probably repurchase. i like many others bought a small and should have purchased an extra small i still was sweating when i worked out with them and it was only 20 minutes had i not been interrupted i feel it would have been more . yes there is an odor i have asthma and it did not bother me. yes is swooshes but not very noticeable . when the rain stops i will run my regular 5 miles and if amazon allows me to i will provide another review .. i am going to buy and extra small but from another brand  3 days later so i washed my pants with tide and the smell is not bad @ all .. i don\\'t hear anymore swishing when i walk run  aerobics or wait lifting .. (when i was outside i took off my earphones to make sure and no sounds from the pants ) i think it\\'s either because the crouch is hanging and the pants r too big are maybe the thighs are rubbing together .. but honestly  i wouldn\\'t care  i will still wear them. once i washed them they are still a little big in the crouch but i still have to peel them off . i worked out inside with the 500 calorie burn dvd from the firm it\\'s about 60 minutes .....omg my tank top was saturated with sweat the sweat was running down my legs as well ..  i like the pants i think they do what they promise and they don\\'t look bad @ all .  when i took them off they were totally soaked . also i also think rhey give me more support when running and back support when weight training.  they do however come all the way up to my chest just below my sports bra. i will buy an extra small ..  oh by the way i am only 5\\'3 and i weigh 125 so that may be why i have to pull them up so far ...  here is an update about 2 month later the pants r still in great shape the somewhat of a chemical smell is gone . i do not here any swooshing.. it\\'s still produces a great sweat. i have lost inches .. i don\\'t see any progress in cellulite but after all the squats and the spin classes i will have to invest in thermage to get rid of the stubborn cellulite i am stuck with .. i will be buying a smaller size and maybe just then shorts. do you think anyone wants a round house kick to the face while i\\'m wearing these bad boys????  i don\\'t think so. these are super, super cute. the fabric is of good, thick quality and the construction is solid. they are extremely comfortable and flattering on my body type, taller and lean. however, someone who is more curvy could rock these just as well. shipment came fast and reasonably packed. this was for a gift and i was impressed how quickly i received it!  the  recipient will enjoy it, i\\'m sure! these pants are amazing.  they hold everything in nicely without feeling too tight.  very nice!  i bought the size down as suggested by other reviews and that does seem the way to go. i bought these for my husband..  he loves them. i would have given a 5 star, but the length shrunk up some and seams to shrink each time they are laundered and i use cold water only. these are the best fitting yoga pants on the market for petite sized women. great fit and fabric. i will buy these again! i love these pants!!  i\\'m 6\\'2 and have never (until now) found a yoga pant long enough. they do run a bit small so i recommend ordering a size up. i ordered 2 sizes up because i am 7 months pregnant and they fit perfectly, even after washing and drying. they are so comfy i will definitely be ordering another pair, or two!  i also like the fact they are made in the usa. a big plus in my book. all in all a great buy! great! looking for something high quality and good price, and are suitable .... too long in the shot is the only drawback. most comfortable pants i own!!! they are a little long, but since i\\'m 5\\'9\\'\\' they fit perfectly and give me the extra length i need...if i could id wear these everyday! definately ordering more soon :) i bought these for skiing and i want to wear them all the time. they fit snug and warm and make me feel sexy! the material is so comfortable..it\\'s almost feels like your wearing nothing.  great for summer!  i\\'d buy another pair i haven\\'t worked out as much as i wanted to in these pants bc i\\'m so busy with my children. however the times i have worn them i can see a difference. once i workout more frequently i know i will see more results!!!! nice the pants were even more than what i was looking for,. it was my fault for choosing a size that was too large for me. i made my choice after reading to many reviews from other customers on other pants. the sizes seem to be right on as far as i am concerned.. i live in chile (southamerica) so not all products on amazon ship to my house, but these yoga pants are (not kidding) the best piece of clothing i have ever had!!! i swear with these pants and a hoodie, your life will be complete. they fit perfectly and i love the color!! i recomend it 100% !! love being able to show off my culture in a unique way! i should have ordered the next size up, as these pants fit me a bit small. very comfy and look great for the price! these pants do everything they advertise to do. they have a higher rise, around the belly button, which is what i wanted so i\\'m not showing off my stomach or back side when stretching and working out. that is specifically what i was looking for. this cut is a great fit for a pear shape, as it helps balance you out. they are a tad snugger than i would have preferred around the hips, but not enough to go up a full size. this means sometimes i notice a slight panty line, but nothing i can\\'t handle in the gym, and they are otherwise extremely flattering so i can live with that. for size reference, i am 5&#34;4, 155, and normally wear a m (8/10) on top and a l (12/14) on bottom. i ordered a large in these. i am closer to the 12 than the 14, so if you\\'re at the top range, you might consider going up a size, but if you\\'re like me, the next size up would be too much. the length is perfect. i have worn and washed twice, according to the directions, and they are holding up well so far. product works very well.i found it best to get the item nearly dry,then wet the waistband and use it. i am obsessed !! it\\'s my 7 th pair i think very happy with my pants i love them so i love palazzo pants but sadly i am not built for the average palazzo size . coming in at 5\\'4&#34;, 150 lbs,32 inch waistline, 41 inch hip most of these pants are simply out of my size range. many stores carry what i consider junior sizes in these pants and leggings even if they are xl. well after much searching i hit upon these and based on the reviews i felt fairly confident even with my postpartum body i wouldn\\'t be too disappointed. they fit my waist just a bit loose, and enhance my ample rear just fine, however in the thighs it seems a bit too clingy you can see the high thigh to lower thigh side curve- my fellow thunder thigh women will know what i am talking about. they will definitely loosen up with wear as long as they aren\\'t prone to shrinkage. all in all i am keeping them because i am expecting to lose another 20lbs over the next few months all in the thigh region and until then with a long tunic they will be suitable. the material is thin stretchy but better quality than at most boutique shops which will charge $35- $50 for the look but sell $10 knockoffs. the have the feel of high end pajama bottoms but are suitable for outdoor fun. it\\'s exactly what i expected, so much better than the walmart brand my daughter gets. highly recommend and the price is great. only complaint is that it took forever coming from california, one of the last things that i received and it was one of the first things i bought. they could try a bit harder to speed up their time the hubby is so pleased with these pants. great quality and look good too!! highly recommend them and the price is decent. bought for grandson and he loved it. gave these as a gift to my wife for xmas and she loves them was a little worried when i received the package and opened it!! was very pleased with how it looked on just as described in the picture.  can dress it up or down very comfy! was worried about the breast area but material stretches well.  i am medium build about 5\\'8 with long legs liked how it was long enough.  ordered the taup color really pretty silky like! stretchy belly portion is soft and comfortable, doesn\\'t dig in anywhere weird and has been able to accomodate 2-6mo so far. wonderful quality. perfect for actually doing yoga.. it\\'s not that weird cotton that stretches out and looks all saggy. this material is smooth, breathable and very stretchy but if ur looking for comfort get a size bigger. i have another velrose petti pants and found that i have to get bigger size to comfortably fit the thighs.  the only complaint i have is that in doing so, the waist is a little loose.  i am happy to find this as i hate wearing slips.  this is a great replacement for wearing slips under skirts. very good quality for a great price.  it is very soft and silky.  i bought it in 4 of them in different colors. really stylish, super easy to take care of...need minimun ironing ...in short a dream come true !!!<br />come in lots of stylish and easy to combine colors.... i fits perfectly showing all your curves and edges it a great pants i don\\'t normally write reviews but i was sooo happy to receive these pants, they were exactly what i was hoping for. i wanted a warm snug pant to wear around the house during the winter, and being a larger size right now, i wanted something comfortable that wouldn\\'t dig in anywhere.<br /><br />these pants are nice and warm, thin enough to not be bulky and stretch-clingy enough to not sag, i even slept with them on and they look fine. i\\'m 5\\'8&#34; and right now using a 2x, so i got a 3x after reading other reviews about it running small. i\\'m glad i did, one size up fits comfortably and is long enough (below the ankle) with a soft waistband that doesn\\'t leave a mark.<br /><br />i wouldn\\'t wear them outdoors, they are not matte and are thicker than tights, so i\\'ll be using at home, with a long sleeve sweater and snug as a bug! my older daughter has several chloe noel skating pants (more than 6), and these are now all she wears on the ice. they are great year round. they seem lightweight, but provide exactly the kind of warmth needed for the skaters due to the fabric content. the fit is as expected, and conducive to helping the coach see exactly the skaters form so they can help make correction. if your coach is anything like ours, they expect the skater to wear form fitting clothes to help them see the form of the skater.<br /><br />both of my girls are competitive figure skaters, and my youngest is now wearing the chloe noel\\'s that her older sister has passed down to her. we have had other brands of skating pants, but so far the chloe noel\\'s have held up the best, and are the truest to size fit. i would definitely recommend these skating pants to any skater. great as always perfect pair of jegging very good excellent product and well made - it just didn\\'t fit like i wanted. comfy! the only thing i wished this product came with a wig just like ken comes with a blonde wig. bought for daughter, who is 5 ft., 3 inches tall.  will likely have to remove @ 4 inches from hems, so she doesn\\'t lose it on the stairs one day.  aside from that, my daughter loves these pants! these fit perfectly is very good. i\\'m actually wearing these now. they\\'re the only pair of yoga pants i\\'ve found so far that actually fit everything, including the waist. if they become available again, i definitely recommend. i love these! i\\'m usually a 34-35 hip, and wear a small or a medium in most department store leggings.<br />the colors are clear and bright, it doesn\\'t look blurred like some other knock-off leggings. the fabric isn\\'t that usual shiny fabric, it\\'s more matte and thicker, so they keep me warmer which is great! the only problem for me is that they are a bit big, totally wearable but a little bit larger , which is great for size medium and larges, because we all know the dreaded one size fits all is a hit or miss! shipping was as expected, the 1-2 month wait, but mine arrived a little over 3 weeks after purchase so that was great! i like the composition of the material, very comfortable, come in size. i recommend to all who involved in sports. i liked them. they fit as expected. thanks. daughter loves them heavy weight and fells good on those cooler days.  holding up good and fits true to size.  i will probably order another pair. gift ordered these in green. love them, but the fabric is very thin and the color is much lighter than what is shown. great quality, great pants.  has plenty of pockets perfect for hunting, airsofting, or any outdoor activities.  my only concern with these pants is that in the photo, they have a darker tint to them than regular acu pants.  in the real product, this is not the case.  they are normal acu colored trousers but they still work great. they look awesome. i would definitely size up if you can. i hope they dont shrink because they will be too small.<br />oh and a little hard to get on...<br /><br />arrived earlier than i thought. great quality, i\\'m 5.ft 10&#34; ordered35 &#34; really nice and long probably should have ordered a size med .i usually wear a 8 to 10 depending on co. a large a little loose nice pants. great quality. cute design. soft and super comfortable. baby is happy wearing it. i will buy more in the future. the question you should be asking yourself should be &#34;when will i get these pants?&#34; not &#34;should i?&#34;<br /><br />i wore these bad boys on the 4th of july this year and i can honestly say i\\'ve never felt so american. nothing says america like a pair of flag pants. the whole city was in awe; everywhere i went i got thumbs up and high-fives.<br /><br />get this pants, they will change your life (for the better). they also had a nice fit, for those of you who were wondering. excellent! love the fit and feel of material.<br />would recommend to any athletic person.<br />they are long enough and i am 6\\' tall again, what can i say..........perfect fit, fabric quality excellent, wash n wear. get complements every time i wear them. i would like to see more in a red print but it must be subtle. feels a little large but one size fits all!! also i\\'m pregnant so it definitely gives plenty room to grow as well as staying comfortable.<br />my only issue i had was that the fabric is very thin. perfect for the hot days but not so good in the sun since that makes it see-through. my suggestion is wear a slip and you\\'ll be fine! i\\'m an 18! glad  i purchased it..many compliments... it will look even better once i shed some pounds... have 7 months to do so... : )<br /><br />def not just for small ppl...comfy...nice neck piece... gladiator sandals..  black is true..didn\\'t look wishy-washy after the first wash... my daughter is 5.5 years old. her weight is 19 kegs and height is 115 cm. does size large fit on her? thank you my four year old was in diapers at night time only before i purchased these. i was looking for something to transition him to underwear at night as well. i knew he\\'d need a little extra than just regular underwear, and these are just that. a few things: i thought they ran a little big .. just a bit though. however, my son is also pretty tall and skinny for his age. the most important tip i can give is  if you are trying to prevent accidents with these, (save your bed sheets/furniture from leaks)  you may want to opp for something else. these are intended to prevent nothing more than a trickle .. enough for your child to realize that their wet, and hopefully make it to the potty in time. i\\'d recommend these only if your child is in the final phase of potty training. for that, their perfect! in fact with two weeks of use my son had his first small accident last night. he drank too much juice before bed, and wet himself a little before waking. they absorbed the little that came out, and alerted him he was wet .. perfect. i\\'m am a happy mom. for the price, i\\'m very happy. (i have short legs so they are too long for me, but i knew they ran long when i ordered them) i was hesitate at first, but these are so comfy. they are great for wearing to class during the winter. great!  my wife loves these and says they\\'re super comfortable.  they\\'re her go-to lounging pants. everything went well this was bought for our daughter who is going in the hospital for serious surgery.  she will need some fun to help her laugh. since this is one of her favorite shows, i thought bazinga would do the trick.. being 6\\'4&#34; i pretty much knew they may be a bit short. because of the balloon bottoms they fit without the baggy bottoms. a fair price for a nice product. either i need shorter legs or they need to make a size for taller filks. soft, love the pattern, super comfortable, however the pants do loses there shape as you wear them during  the day. they would be great if the had a drawstring since the stretch out during  the day. or buy a smaller size. i\\'m 5\\'8 my pant size is a 14 i ordered a xl, would have been fine with a l. perfect i have a 10-piece modular molle gear set from utg in woodland digital and this worked perfectly with that.  it definitely retains heat well.  i was a little sweaty indoors.  outdoors it\\'s nice.  the material seems sturdy and while i haven\\'t yet given it a thorough beating, i\\'m not worried about it not holding up. i recently purchased these pants for my 27-month old son and am happy with them. they are extremely soft, seem very comfortable, look cute, and they wash and wear well. the elastic and drawstrong waste also works well (especially for potty training): stays on but are not restrictive or uncomfortable. the only thing i don\\'t like about them is that they look like they might be inside out when they are not because of the way the trim is. it\\'s odd, but not terrible. still great pants, though. these shorts are awesome wish i bought more in differant colors will next time the fit was great and the color was perfect i love these, they are so soft and comfortable! a bit big but the cinch tabs on the side help the pants fit better. so cute on. these pants have become my favorite not just for the gorgeous and unique embroidery, but because they are flattering, soft and comfortable.  the lines of the pants are slimming and the waist fits easily without binding.  i get lots of compliments on the beautiful dancing nataraja embroidery and it\\'s unlike anything else out there.  i have long legs and these pants hit me at just the right spot, so if you are more petite, you might need to hem.  i have a pair with the lotus on the sacrum, too and i just can\\'t have too many of these! i have purchased two pair of zaggora hot pants and the only differences i find between these two brands are price and fit.  the slimhot pants are longer and fit closer to the lower legs; the hip area is larger, but still fits close for a good sweat during exercise and the waist comes up high enough so that i\\'m not constantly pulling at it because it\\'s sliding down.  however, the waist does fall a bit lower in the back as my rear end is bigger and that\\'s uncomfortable and the zaggora brand has cloth inserts over the neoprene in the inner thighs so the neoprene doesn\\'t rub when you walk and makes for a quieter fit during exercising.  both make for a good sweat just wearing around the house.  time will tell if i lose inches. i wear size xl so at first i thought they would be too small, but then i put them on and they fit perfectly. i love the colors in the fabric and the loose, casual style. just perfect for the beach this summer. i love the look and fit item shipped promptly and arrived early, the leggings are very nice and comfortable with bright color. i\\'m not large but i\\'m not tiny either, just curvy in the middle and they fit just fine. they do have a strange rubber/plastic smell i hope will come out after washing great love them! they are soooooo comfy and cute! and came in a great time! these are so comfortable and perfect for the house best pair of pants i own. they make my booty look nice and legs too. they\\'re a little on the spendy side, but i\\'d say they\\'re worth it. love it! i bought the newborn size for my 6.5 lb newborn, since all other pants looked like clown pants on her.  these pants fit her well and kept her nice and warm.  of course she has outgrown them already, but i was grateful to find something that would fit a tiny baby.  other \\\\\\\\\"newborn\\\\\\\\\" styles in other brands were still way too big. i ordered the sponge bob watch for my granddaughter for her birthday.  when i ordered it i got my order number to verify it went through.  the next day i recieved a e-mail stating it didn\\'t go through.  i ordered it again.  i was sent and billed for two watches.  i have since tried returning one of these watches.  i am not getting any responce from carson\\'s collectibles. i got these for my dad for father\\'s day because we live in metro-detroit and the tigers were recently sporting these around.  he got a kick out of them!  perfect &#34;fat-pants&#34; for around the house. my grandson says it\\'s great and will wear it most days.  he said it\\'s a great replacement for the one issued by the marine corps. nice! stretchy but not too much. the pants just fitted to me by the end of the day. the hips portion was a bit tough, but thats cause i got hips. i am 127 llbs, 5\\'3 and they were great! love them~ my son bought my husband and i a pair for christmas and at first i was embarrassed but he made us wear them on christmas. then it was kindof fun. so now, i got them for the other kids and now every christmas we have a new tradition. thanks. love these little pants:)!  they are small and totally cute.  probably more like 0-3 months, not too sure if they will fit all the way until 6 months, but we\\'ll find out. fast service, will order again. fit well and arrived very fast!  i\\'m 6&#34;1 and have a small waist, about 29&#34; around, and the medium size fits very well!  they also have smaller opening around your feet so they conform around your ankle, not just a big hole.  very nice! super comfortable. i love this onesie!  i keep it in the diaper bag for blow-out changes.  it\\'s compact and perfectly thin and breathable for summer.  wish i could afford more of these. nice the pants are very nice. fabric is just right in thickness and very soft. fits snug but not to tight. color is perfect too. it does have a huge bell bottom. the pic on amazon looks as thou its a straight leg. over all, i like them and i will keep them i ordered a size small, nothing really bad to say a bout this shirt. i love it. besides she\\'s hawt !!!! feels great on my legs when i workout cute design, stretchy, but can be a bit revealing when they stretch. they are stretchy and cute, a little long for me but the large fits really well. i brought the wrong size but is very good give to a friend and they fit her good will oder another one my size i really loved them. totally comfortable the material these are made out of are super soft, however they don\\'t look like harem pants, they just look like they have large pockets (they don\\'t have pockets at all).  the material is thin, so you can see socks and panty lines through it but great to lounge around in a pair with heels. these pants are very comfortable and i was surprised at the fit and quality. i\\'m a little short so they are longer than i would like them but i love them. this is my second pair! my grand daughter just loves her christmas present and wore it the same day she received it!!  thank you it looks great on her. i purchased these pants a few days ago and i now know how i am going to make it through the rest of my pregnancy through the hot summer. these pants are light and comfortable and they look great too. i got many compliments on my pants. was purchased as present for december birthday. wear these all the time<br />best workout pants my daughter loves peppa pig. please note they are red not orange comfy, cushy, and funny, any fan of this awesome show will love these!  my fiance and i wear them all the time! these did the job of keeping our floor semi-dry while also letting our son know if he didn\\'t quite make it to the potty.  they\\'re his favorite undies because he can get them down and up easily because the band at the top isn\\'t solid elastic.  definitely recommend for potty training and for the next year+.  our son was 2 years 3 months at training, fyi. the pants arrived on time.  the fit is great, the pants are perfect for the beach, fresh fit ;) cute, soft and fit nicely. taking one star away because after one wash, a tiny hole formed in the fabric. for the price, i expected more for durability good i really enjoy this product. they fit great and come in a variety of fun colors. i got a pair in every color! the pants are a shiny black, which actually gives it a nice look. they are somewhat thin and the material seems to be nylon-like. they fit true to size. my only problem with them is that they are way too short. i\\'m 5\\'7 and there\\'s no way i can wear these with heels. may look ok with flats but still need to be a little longer even for that. very good quality of material; just what i have looking for for my granddaughter. if you\\'re going for an accurate costume, you\\'d be better off buying an actual gi and sparring gloves, everything else though is of good quality and the right size. a little overpriced if you ask me, but for a halloween costume, it\\'s more than sufficient. i am very picky about clothes and nothing seems to fit me well, but these are awesome! i am 5\\'4&#34; and the length is slightly long but do-able in heels. i agree with the other reviewer that the waist is very slimming because it has a thicker band along the waist that is very flattering. i was a little worried that the material would be too hot because i live in a tropical state, but so far it hasn\\'t been a problem. though a little pricey, these are quality pants that last. i have had them a little over a year and wear them every other day to work and wash them in the washing machine and dry them in the dryer and they haven\\'t shown the slightest bit of wear or tear - no fraying or fading or wrinkling or shrinking. i admit i am not very kind to my clothes and these hold up incredibly well and still look polished.  i would definitely buy more of these pants and highly recommend them. i ordered as pj bottoms and they are super cute can even be worn outside.  they do run a little small but are figure flaterring.  a lot of people complained that they were not cotton as described and they are right.  the material is thicker. these are awesome pants. i received a lot of compliments at work, people wanting to know where i got them from.<br />they were very comfortable. i will be getting some more as soon as they are in my size. i got the xl and they fit perfectly. i have a hard time finding the &#34;perfect&#34; dress pant.  i really like the joe benbasset line and have never been disappointed.  the fit is great for my curves.  its too bad there aren\\'t other colors in the same style! love these, they are very light and breathable. this is my second pair! color is true to the picture i bought a second pair and will get a third. most comfortable and soft workout pants ever. totally awesome comfort and very light. waist fits well and not overly binding. very finely woven mesh. wash well and dry fast. do not shrink. do not snag . look nice and hang on you well. best ever! size is true. lounging pants good fit! ordered a medium, but probably should have got a small.  slim 5\\'7&#34; 135lbs male. nice fit and nice look for a cheap price..!!! these are super comfy..but  i would wear them in the house only, because i think they make you butt and hips look big but they are a sat, rainy day go to :o the first pair i got, the butt was ripped, they were nice enough to send me a second pair! i weight 150lbs and fit perfect. love them but they are quite tight getting them on wife loves it theses yoga harem pants are so comfortable! the material is soft and can be worn to work out. i wear them all over the place! i weigh 142 pounds and i ordered a large so they are open and loose as the picture. they can actually look as casual dressy with the right top and jewelry. i would highly recommend these pants. i ordered this skirt for tennis and yes it is cute and fabric is so velvetty soft. color is just like in picture and i am 5\\'4&#34; - 125 lbs and the size s fit me well. i\\'m in love with these harem pants. normally their either too baggy but these fit perfectly. i\\'m 5&#34;2 and weigh 114lbs and the medium fits great. not only are these pants comfy but their affordable and chic. perfect for those lazy days, days you have hiphop class , go to the gym or days in which you don\\'t want to dress up for school but still look cute. i\\'m in love with the black harem pants that i\\'m planning to order the teal, garnet, and gray ones. these pants look cute with either crop tops, tank tops, or long sleeves. delivery was quick. i received them within four business days.trust me you won\\'t be disappointed! outstanding pants! i cannot believe i scored these for $20 because i can\\'t find these locally for less than $45. ($32 for digi acu) kudos to sportsman\\'s guide for offering these great pants at a great price! knee pads are great for all around house work, and some recent \\\\\\\\\"run n\\' guns i did with some military friends recently (nutnfancy style) only was offered in the od green which isn\\'t my favorite color but for $20 you can\\'t beat it for the colder weather coming. i absolutely adore them! i ordered a large by mistake though so they\\'re a little big. but it was my fault! they\\'re so soft and flowy! pants were beautiful! just was too big for me. you have to order 2 sizes down. nice pants, especially for the price.  size is a bit big. i purchased several in black and several in grey, the fit is a bit inconsistent but nothing major, especially if i drop a few lbs.  highly recommend. a little tight it would be nice if they came in a larger size these sweatpants are just what i wanted.  the color is soft gray & the pants are soft too.  i\\'m going to order another pair. i bought these jeans on saturday from tx and they arrived here monday from fl !the jeans got here faster than i thought. i\\'m 5\\'5 and 137lbs i wear a size 5 or 6 in jeans and i got the size medium and they fit perfect except for they were a bit too long but not too much i just fold in the extra. they are super stretchy and surprisingly the material isn\\'t as cheap feeling as i thought, the material seems pretty good. these jeans make your waist seem smaller and your butt look great! they came with the sellers info so you can contact her in case you wanted to exchange them. i\\'m glad i bought them. these fit my 17 month old pretty much exactly the same as the 2t size, but they both work fine so that\\'s okay. the colors are cute! :) love love love these pants!! they are aupwr comfortable and cute on! they fit perfect! i will be ordering more for sure these pajamas fit well and are really fun. perfect for the young at heart. these are some of the best pajama bottoms around. they aren\\'t super thick, which is great for when you want longer pants, but not the heat that normally comes with them. they are just the right length and fits very well. color has not faded after multiple washes. would recommend to any big bang theory fan. i work from home, so this has always been a running joke with the crowd i work with. there are so comfortable! great fit prompt service love it best leggings ever you cannot see through them. i\\'ve had a gray pair for over 2 years and so thankful i found them on amazon. comfy i was seriously considering buying the zubaz pants at the original price of $39.95.  the day i noticed the price had been marked down to $34.95, i got myself into a pair of these babies and never looked back.  as a busy executive, i keep a tight schedule. these versatile zubaz pants are just the ticket.  pairing them with a blazer makes a bold statement in the boardroom... and at day\\'s end i head straight from the office to the gym, no wasted time changing outfits!  thanks zubaz, you\\'re a class act.<br /><br />[edit: update- these pants make my package look really awesome... hello ladies!] my grandson has a disorder that causes him to have great difficulty with things that touch his skin.  he usually only wears gym shorts or workout pants.  wanting to be more stylish, he decided to give these a go and i\\'m so glad he did.  they are large enough in the leg to not trigger his vomit reflex, and look great, too! i love these pants because i am a hip hop dancer my self so i understand why they are so comfortable to be in and when i dance i feel like i can move freely better than normal sweat pants want to begin with the shipping. i ordered it on thursday evening, got it on monday. very impressed with the promptness of delivery .<br /><br />onto the actual product. it\\'s definitely the real thing. very well made, no defects or any other errors that i can locate. they fit me very well, perfect if i use a belt. digital pattern is spot on, sharp lines and uniform in pattern. it is indeed fire resistant.<br /><br />other than a slightly beat up delivery box which does not effect anything in my opinion, there are no pieces of criticism i can find or give for this product. affordable and high quality. highly recommend. these are exactly what i wanted. i think i may have lost a few lbs because it\\'s just a little loose, but it\\'s better than being too small. the pants fit well, order a size up.. i love the high waist and the length is good as well. they are surprisingly comfortable and seem to be well constructed. i haven\\'t washed them yet but for the price, i\\'m good with them only lasting several wears. my friends are wondering where i get such great looking pants. i tell them and they don\\'t believe me. i love the product and have more on my christmas wish list. i received my order very quickly. the pants were a perfect fit {small}and the fabric didn\\'t look cheap. it was soft but strong. perfect! love these pants however i would go two sizes up. they are soft and very cute. this product is not an &#34;over sized&#34; xl. when i bend over i feel like my butt is going to pop out, but other than that they fit well and and the color is gorgeous! i have several other sev products and since i was shopping for some new slacks i thought i would give these a try.<br /><br />first off, the fabric quality is excellent. these pants have the same quality fabric that you find in most of the higher end khaki\\'s and cotton dress slacks. they look good enough for a night on the town or a business meeting.<br /><br />second, the pockets are wonderful. the two front pockets are very deep, almost half way down my thigh, so you can carry most anything you would normally put in your pants with plenty of room and no bulge from a overfilled pocket. there is even a smaller pocket within the pocket to keep things organized.<br /><br />as with all the other sev products i have purchased, i\\'m very pleased with the quality and function. while $70 seems a lot to pay for another pair of pants, these are well worth the extra just for the added carrying capacity.<br /><br />also, the new waistband will stretch with you, so if you happen to go out and have a big meal, or put on a few pounds over vacation, you wont\\' feel squeezed. i was very happy & my 7month old was very comfortable! he has severe itchy skin due to his eczema. the material is 100% cotton which is exactly what i needed. he looked handsome & everyone loved it! love these.  bought as a replacement for worn trainers left over from previous children, and they are way more soft and comfortable to the touch.  the fit was as expected for our 3-yr old. love it! mj so cozy and cute. they are longer than i expected, but that\\'s ok. nice yoga pants. length is to top of calf.  quick delivery. fits well and plenty of room for your junk and whatever you have to smuggle. i used these to store cash on an overseas trip but a small pill bottle would fit in there just fine. i loved the product!  the packaging was great, hardly no wrinkles. the product was stylish and fit just like the picture.  i liked it soo much i ordered two pair for myself.  this pair was for my daughter and she loves them. it was a size too small for me and what i did was i exercise daily to fit it when i got this pants i was afraid than they were to big, but they fit perfect and the bottom is amazing, i feel confortable and it match with my 70\\'s blouse. i love them they are super comfortable and the fit was perfect i am very pleased with the purchase i made i ordered the 38w/34l and they fit exactly as they should.  i like the quick opening velcro pockets.  the chocolate brown with a brown leather belt looks just right.  $40 plus $4 s&h. after chili and bud light, it is nice they have an air release opening in the front to release pressure.  no need for modesty and a button. bought as gift for my 17-year old daughter. she loves it so mmuch the pants arrived timely. fit true to size. the pants are a little long, even in heels, but i will be having them hemmed. the color(s) are unique for me and go well together. i ordered a cute pair of heeled sandals that should really complete the outfit. can\\'t wait to wear. good purchase. thanks. i normally wear 36x32 and originally ordered size l.  not in the market for running tights that shrink wrap one\\'s ugly fruit, but not wanting them too baggy either.  the large were far too tight from the thighs up for my liking, so i exchanged for xl.  they are still a tad more snug than i would prefer from waist to upper thigh, but overall pleased.  like some others, i cut off the stirrups to make them more comfortable, and the length is about right.  ran in weather of upper 30s and found them to be sufficiently warm once i got going. great fit and finish, high quality and great price! very warm. my mother loves them definitely fits with my love of supernatural :) fit great. comfy. a little long but great quality best fitting jeans ever i bought this as a gift and it was a big hit.  if you know anyone who wishes they could join the ravenclaw house of harry potter this is a perfect gift for them.  the emblem and the wording are very good quality and as you would expect the pants are quite comfortable. soft and comfortable.  not as thick as flannel, so it\\'s the perfect for my husband who tends to get too warm in flannel pajama pants.  would purchase again. the pants fit my 3 year old as expected, just a little long as he is 37lbs and 37-38&#34;. i love the look and fit, but, the material is a little thin. i suspect there will be a ripped knee or two before too long. my son is on the ground on his knees playing with trucks and toys and tends to put a lot of wear and tear in that area specifically. while all pants will succumb to it eventually, some are better than others. hoping i\\'m wrong with these! but the thin material leaves me doubtful. i\\'m about a size 10-12 depending on the clothing line, and these pants fit a bit tight in the elastic around my waste and calves, but they are still pretty comfortable (and i\\'m sure they will stretch out.)  they are very novel and unique and i\\'ve not seen anyone walking around cambridge, ma, wearing them.  love these pants. i,m so happy! with this cotton  harem jumpsuit. i love it so much. it fitt always  ! these fit very similarly to other clothes in this size range, and the fabric is really soft. it\\'s not super heavy or lightweight, so they\\'re great pants to wear around the house or throw in your diaper bag. these training pants arrived on time and as expected.  my daughter loves to wear them. they are thicker in the crotch so there is some absorption but not much.  i have to keep a close eye on her when i let her wear them. a little small for what i\\'d consider a plus-size pant, but very very soft, comfy, and cute. these are super comfy pants for my chunky 3 month old. he\\'s about 18 pounds and i bought the 6-9 month size. they haven\\'t faded or shrunk in the wash. great trendy neutral colors go with lots of his onesies. these are amazing!!! look just like jeans and fit so nice! rather wear these than my real blue jeans haha! great investment :) got lots of compliments on them. they look just like blue jeans but so much cheaper!!! highly recommend! they look cheap but they definitely don\\'t feel cheap or are made cheaply! love, love, love these pants!!! fist perfectly and lifts up the booty!! these are my absolute most favorite pants ever. they fit well, they\\'re super soft and i always get complements when i wear them. these look great! the material is kind of thin, which i love the feeling of i just hope they don\\'t wear down fast.  even if they do i still might buy the same pair over again, especially for such a reasonable price. i really like them gift from grandparents my son loves them he wont take them off i wear them every day. granddaughter loves it. thanks for enclosing a gift card. love it! just what i expected! i really do like these pants.  they are great for work.  but they definitely run large!  i have wallflower jeans in the same size (11) that are way smaller, and fit better.  i should have ordered size 9, apparently.  i like the fabric and the way the pockets are cut.  they definitely have enough room for serious booty and a smaller waist, but not too extreme either.  love the fit overall but i know these will be too big for me with any weight loss at all, so that\\'s a bummer.  i would safely say order 1 size down from what you normally wear in this brand.  i really wish these came in other colors like brown, navy, and grey because they are comfortable yet dressy enough for the office.  i also like the way the leg is cut because it\\'s straight and doesn\\'t fit tightly like skinnies but looks nice and modern, no bell shape at the bottom which is nice.  i feel like this review is all over the place, but as a bottom line...yeah, i would recommend these pants. i bought this for my photography business. which i really like! only problem is they said infant size and its a little bigger.. it fits a 6mo old great! nice fit very well ! üòÜüíØ i love these pants and have them in multiple sizes and colors for my son. they are roomy enough to fit a variety of body types, but even though my son is pretty skinny, they still look adorable on him and are loose enough for him to crawl around the floor without being hindered by tight clothing. they hold up very well in the wash in terms of color, fit, and softness. i just wish they had a few more gender neutral colors because i\\'d buy every last one! like wearing good looking pjs...am 5\\'4&#34;, and as expected too long..going to order other colors. i had these pants decades ago, and was delighted to find they were still being made! got them for a birthday gift - could not be happier. i\\'d wear them 24/7 if i thought i could get by with it at work. ;) great for exercise, long walks, lounging, running errands - probably not appropriate for office wear, but it\\'s soooo tempting. good very comfortable, well-made, soft and hang nice.  i\\'m going to order another pair, would order a lot more, if they were cheaper! my daughter loves them the nicest little baby outfit gift. this is such a soft material and looks so comfortable. favorite!! good trade my wife bought the first pair and loved them so much i bought her another pair for her birthday.  they fit well and are well-constructed. so cute! i think my new nephew will look good in it when he arrives this fall. :-) i use these for yoga and &#34;lazy saturdays&#34; they fit great and are very comfortable. ill more than likely order more. the picture shows only the pants and they were wonderful.  however, i ordered the matching jacket; it was thin and the zipper was plastic and would not have lasted 3 zips, let alone a gentle cycle wash. perfect fit. very comfortable, doesn\\'t even feel like you\\'re wearing them. i was wondering if it came in a bigger sizes? want to get one for a friend, but he\\'s little bigger, any help would be appreciated. thanks i love everything about these pants!!! these arrived the date expected & i tried them on right away & fell in love! they are super super comfy and im considering ordering another pair! i absolutely love these yoga pants! they fit perfectly and they dont shrink in the wash! i even love the little red tag that shows when you fold them over! the material is not what looks like in the pictures but i like the fitting i ware a 10-12 pants size and the large fits good exactly what i expected i love the alfred dunner line of pants, as the sizes run true-to-fit.  i am 5\\'4&#34; tall and it is hard finding pants that are short enough for my size.  i always buy the alfred dunner clothes. fits great! a little sheer, but it\\'s quite comfortable and lovely. man, i love these outfits and wish i could justify spending the money to get more of them!  my baby sleeps in these footies (we have three) and i love, love, love them.  they are so soft and breathable and seem so comfy.  in the summer months i\\'m sure we\\'ll need to find something else for him to sleep in, but for winter and spring these have been wonderful.  however, he\\'s seven months old and slightly above average in size and i can\\'t imagine they\\'ll fit him until he\\'s 12 months.  it won\\'t matter for us due to the seasons, but just for sizing purposes it\\'s good to note. this is a great product for days and nights when it is not too cold as the fabric has great coverage but is thin (i don\\'t need anything thicker unless we\\'re out for a walk when it\\'s wintry out).  the fabric is excellent quality but must be taken care of properly...from my experience, this means no harsh detergents.  from my experience, the only non harsh washing machine detergent is dr bronners liquid castile soap (no i don\\'t use the sal suds as it contains a detergent).  technically, i use soap-not detergent.  i do cloth diapering with this soap and it keeps stains out better, fabric softer than anything else i tried (and i tried alot of conventional products.  i just add a dash of baking soda if there is breastfed poo in the wash but it\\'s really not necessary (i have an he machine). sorry to get off subject but i felt it was important to mention if you don\\'t want the fabric to pill and become rough, use something like castile soap and you won\\'t have any regrets! ps baby has never had diaper rash, i don\\'t use fabric softener, and i don\\'t use creams or powders on his butt - just water and cotton cloth for rinsing at diaper changes.  ps one star off because this does not do well with detergent but to be fair, i have found most baby clothes don\\'t do well with detergent (especially at the rate i wash which is sometimes twice a day in hot water). dr bronners is my solution! these are great for hanging around the house on cool days -- especially for pre-walking babies who like to kick off their socks. i have been dying to bye a pair of ripped leggings and i found this one and i thought it looked really pretty and decided to give them a try! i am 5\\'4 and weight 110 lbs and they fit me perfectly! not to mention the shipping was much quicker than i expected! i ordered it on december 3rd and it was expected to arrive between december 30 and january 16 but it actually arrived on december 16. i have nothing but good things to say about these leggings, they are my favorite pair now :d the quality of this pants proceeded my expectation. it feels soft and comfort, easy to wear. my boy likes to wear it. i purchased these for my daughter at christmas.  she likes them.  they are cute & colorful & comfy.  i wish they were a little cheaper, but these pj\\'s were the best monkey print. i collect leggings and these are one of my favorites.  they fit wonderfully and look great with any oversized top. return for smaller size great fit but you better hand wash or it\\'ll shrink. i really like these pants, one kinda negative thing for me is that they have so many pockets, i forget which one i put phone and keys in, but i really like and enjoy them. had recently bought another brand but these feel like they will last longer. i would highly recommend these pants! i am a 36x34 pant size... i got the large size in khaki, brown, and olive... i am now ordering another pair of khakis and the black ones... they are great... not too short... very comfortable and durable.  easy to wash.  just all around great pants. perfect for any dr. who fan! can\\'t wait to rock them during summer time, i\\'m so grateful these pants made a comeback.  whenever i need to relax, i slip out of my z. cavaricci or acid washed two-tone jeans and slip into this purple, zebra striped wonder.  the bold pattern makes quite a fashion statement and not only does it make me feel manly and comfortable, but it gives me the urge to drop a roundhouse on anyone who crosses me. i love these pants they are everything as described and i love the way they look on me. i don\\'t regret buying these and they look exactly like the picture and they are soo comfy and that\\'s important to me. i would soo recommend these if you want a new unique look:) got these for my mom and she loves them. they are very comfortable for her. the products arrived in time and in good condition.  they are a present for my husband who is former military (how i knew about the product in the first place) and is currently a state trooper, so i appreciate the assistance in keeping him warm this time of year.  these fit easily under his uniform without making him feel bulky or uncomfortable. durable, soft, and fun. great for any doctor who fan. i love it. they have a very great feel to them. they don\\'t feel like your typical yoga pants which is great. they are super long which is a major bonus for me because i am tall.. i washed them first and they fit great. a little thin in the middle but good. she is very small and i was happy that i could find 18 month size. i originally bought a pair in the eggplant color and came back to buy them in all the colors available.  good quality and they fit well.  i love mine... i was a little worried about the fit given the specified sizing (i\\'m a little larger than the max size) but these fit surprisingly well! material is very thin and stretchy (not as thick as some other brands of leggings), so lots of give. definitely can\\'t complain for the price! best sweats i ever had.  but wish black was in stock when i ordered them.  wife likes the way my butt looks in them.  lol i love the gloria vanderbilt pants my husband has a new fav. perfect! perfect fit- very comfortable these are so snuggy and great quality. the length is good and the weight of the fabric is nice. i\\'m 5\\'1.5&#34; (yes, the half-an-inch counts) and the small fits nicely. i bought a fitted through the leg (&#34;skinny&#34;) pair before these and love those equally. the only thing that i\\'d like different for these &#34;charcoal&#34; pair is for them to be &#34;heathered&#34;. the solid grey color is not-so-cute. i\\'m going to order more, but not in charcoal. love these little pants! fit my tiny baby perfect. my 6 month old is very lean but average height and these fit her well. good buy, will buy another set soon. i\\'ve bought these before and loved them - so did again but this time the fabric was a little thicker, which in the summer makes them super hot where i used to wear them as errand pants. still feel awesome though and look great. but more of a spring/fall yoga-capri. the fabric is a little stiff but shouldn\\'t be a problem after a few washes. too thick very comfortable and i love the design i wasn\\'t paying too much attention to the fabric content and thought these would be cotton for some reason, but even though they are not, they are very comfortable. i probably could have gotten away with a small (i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; and 120 lbs), but the style of the pants have a lot of give. the cuffs at the bottom are snug, not tight. i look forward to many days of being lazy in these. i was getting ready to buy new ski pants because the ones i have are not insulated. i was prepared to fork over several hundred bucks when i read about these and figured i\\'d give it a shot. they did not disappoint, the quality is really good with lots of zippers, and they are very warm. i purchased the medium long based on another review and they fit me well (i am 6\\'1&#34; with a 35&#34; waist). note that the legs are not actually full-length like normal pants, they end about 8-10 inches off the floor- but this is exactly what i wanted because i will be wearing ski boots. i\\'m not planning to wear them down to the post office on a winter\\'s day, they will always be worn under ski pants. my son love it awesome very durable/comfortable. . so! i bought these on impulse as well, thinking that they would be okay.<br />i am the same size as that model in the picture, but these pants do not fit the same!<br />they fit much more like these: http://www.amazon.com/pocket-parachute-leggings-stretchy-designer/dp/b00cunfvpe/ref=pd_sim_sbs_a_12?ie=utf8&refrid=1pmcnx7wafx6vdgpdtex<br />i am a little disappointed, especially since i can not fix them myself due to the way they are made.<br />but let me talk about what i do like!<br />the waist fits, they are very light weight and comfortable.<br />the pattern is soo pretty, so many colors&#60;3<br />totally harem pants =))<br />i will wear these even though they don\\'t fit like the picture, just because they\\'re so comfy and unique!!<br />the pockets on them are nice but will not hold anything if you plan to jog or jump or even extend your legs.<br />for the price, these pants can\\'t be beat! they\\'re lovely&#60;3<br />the packaging was nice too, they came quickly, were nicely wrapped in tissue paper inside the box and there was a sticker on the package of a penguin saying &#34;we love our customers!&#34; haha very cute.<br />probably will not buy again. good luck! if you have some little extra weight are just perfect for you, hiding your tummy and shapy you ass) the fit is great. they are longer than comparable pants, but they are perfect for me.  i love them and would order again. chose this gift cause baby is a boy. don\\'t know how they fit as he hasn\\'t been born yet. mommy and daddy loved the colors and how the leg is tailored at the bottom. will let you know after he\\'s here and worn them. i have to wear a back brace, so finding pants (anywhere) that i can wear is really  hard. i found the pants on amazon, but they couldn\\'t be shipped directly here to japan (i don\\'t know why...), so i had them re-shipped by a forwarder. they arrived here before the scheduled us delivery date. you can\\'t beat service like that. because i work with kids  i get lots of stains and spills on them. but they clean up easily. as a teacher it\\'s my policy to not give perfect scores for anything, because everything can be improved, but i\\'d be forced to give these 4.5 stars. great! youj can sleep in these jeans or wear them like regular jeans.flattering and comfortable.worth the money.they also have skinny jeans in pajama jeans but i have yet to find them. those would be really worth it. good quality beautiful green color! looks just like the picture. and they\\'re also warm enough for autumn and winter. i could also wear these in the spring rolled up. festive for the holidays as well!üòä fantastic purchase and really quick delivery! this order arrived promptly and i was extremely pleased with the fit.  i\\'m 5\\'4&#34; and wear a large, the fit was perfect as well as the length.  i love the material and as others have said, the fit is perfect. it even makes my less-than-perfect butt look good!  i bought it in teal, which is beautiful, and plan on buying another pair as well.  highly recommend these pants! material to thin no suppy military grade woodland bdu top.  strong stitching and ripstop material.  true military pattern and color scheme.  this is not offbrand buds. my daughter loves these... they fit more like a size 3, than a 4. love them... i love these pants and the sizing is accurate but they do stretch out throughout the day. however, the elastic in the seams of these pants begins to come out after a couple washes and then it looks like you have little hairs coming out at all the seams...but i love the fit of these pants that after i bought the first pair and noticed the strings i bought a second pair one size down since i lost weight. now the second pair of pants are starting to get &#34;hairy&#34; and i\\'m going to buy another pair.. they\\'re like disposable pants. if you\\'re ok with that then get these pants. nice shipped on time. very comfy. i washed it and it did not shrink. kind of thin fabric but not bad. the only problem is i am about 5\\'9 and they are a tiny bit short but not by much. great pants though. as a member of a belly dance troupe, i bought these pants for performances. they really look great on - they even make my thighs look slimmer. what\\'s not to love about that? the only reason i didn\\'t give them 5 stars is because there\\'s no elastic in the waistband. so, unless you wear a short accent skirt over them or a belt, there\\'s danger of a \\\\\\\\\"wardrobe malfunction.\\\\\\\\\" loved it perfect these fit a littler snugger than expected. in some clothes i can wear a smaller size than i ordered, so i was a little surprised. i was going to order another pair, but i will wait. soft and cozy...absolutely love them! i recommend these stretchy pants.  the sizes run large.  i bought the 0-3 month pants and was able to use them until my son was 6 months.  they wash well.  they are not tight. the quality of the item was very good and it arrived very quickly.  it happened to be much too small for me (be sure to read the sizing information!), but the seller made it right and was responsive in finding a solution for me. i would recommend this product. im grateful i bought these i\\'m 5&#34;1 and 120 lbs so they work but i do find they could be bigger longer i guess would put it more plain. but with a cute short top they look cute. these knit pants fit really well and are true to size. they wash well and the colors are really cute. this is one of my favorite pants! love the materials, comfy and it\\'s definitely worth the money! i love this material. it fit a bit small, so i\\'m going to try to exchange. i have other clothing from this store, so i ordered the same size as i do in the leggings, etc. but these ran a bit small. other than that, love them. i ware a sz 10 and these pants fit so good.  they look great under tunic or short dress.  the fabric is thin but well made fit great. i bought a large and they fit nice not great but nice 160lbs 62 inch my son in law works outside and this will keep him warm all winter. he likes his carhart clothes as they wear well. very good quality i purchased these for my son who has type 1 diabetes. these are a great way to keep insulin pump from tangling during the night. we did order a size bigger because of the previous reviews suggested to get next size up. very nice  fit and so comfortable. they appear to be good quality as well. i will order some more definetly. i love this brand. it\\'s durable and great price. i wish they made bigger sizes for older children. love them, but will this elastic hold out? fits larger than expected.  good, durable cotton and plenty of pocket space.  these are great hiking pants for storing utility knives, cool looking rocks, or even keeping a phone.  i have yet to use the bottom pockets for anything but they look cool. the pants are a bit large and i should have ordered one size down, however the feel is great and the look is too.  i would recommend this to buyers. soft and comfy, a bit long and i had to take in the legs. also good quality great product excellent pants... the confection is unsurpassed as its quality. i worked for 12 years in a state security agency in my country (venezuela) and was tactical and eod operator on numerous occasions in various urban and rural environments and i could see the quality, reliability and adaptability of these tactical pants. its design is the most adaptable to the operator. definitely these pants designer knows his stuff and know that i speak blackhawk! love it! absolutely love these leggings. they are super soft and sexy. only thing i would change is how high they come up. this fits very nicely. i love the color, i love the feel and look of the material.  i just love it. i love em.  perfect fit and look.  wish they had different camo colors.  good work!!!  i will refer others to the site. they are super soft and comfortable. good to wear around the house though i did have to buy one size up to make sure they fit right. great scrubs set. love them and they are actually long enough for my long legs:) i am 5 ft 9 and they fit awesome even better than some of my expensive pairs. will be buying more colors! great pants. love them!!! these jeans are so comfortable, better than wearing sweats, i spend my days writing at my computer and still look properly dressed if i have unexpected visitors. love them but we\\'re a little big u should add and extra small size loved the fit dope pants..i didn\\'t know they were for women, but i cut the legs and made them into harem shorts and now i work out in them...comfortable and a lot of room to move around good looking, comfortable workout pants.  i think they\\'re sharp. these winter undergarments are both light weight and warm. they fit under pants (including dress pants) discreetly. love the look just need to lose 5 lbs to wear comfortably i\\'ve looked for these in stores with no luck, i\\'m very thankful that amazon had them. it will make it a lot easier with those pink training pants for my cousins granddaughter to be potty trained. sincerely allison ray absolutely love these!  i wish they had more patterns! so, so soft! great! nice for potty trainning great product.  my wife loves the pants and i move the look. i was a student teacher this year and i added coaching baseball to my duties. it was a lot of fun, but i needed some pants to coach in (league rules, plus it was great to participate in practice when extras were needed.) these fit great. they\\'re quite long, but the inside has a velcro strip that makes re-sizing them a piece of cake. holy america. that is all i can say.<br />i wore these on the fourth of july in washington d.c. hoping that obama would take a selfie with me, unfortunately there was no sight of him. that is the only downside to these magical pants. i love them pocket was bigger then i thought fits so damn good. got me a boyfriend at a pub. i\\'d say 5/5 pretty good comfortable very nice.  i love the roll top waist.  it helps to hold the stomach in when left up.  the legs fit snuggly and go out to a small flare at the bottom.  my personal preference is slightly looser legs around the thighs, but i think most will like the snug legs.  they aren\\'t too short in length, which is a problem with most jazz pants. i have tried many different scrub bottoms in search of the best fit. these are by far the best i have come across in terms of fit, comfort, and over all affordability. i have had my first pair for two years and after many washes they are still perfect. they fit true to my size (small). i would suggest buying one pair and seeing how you like them before buying multiple pairs because scrubs are going to fit people differently. for the price, i give this scrubs two thumbs up! do buy these. they give you a sense of comfort while being fashionable. you can wear them high-waist if you want. extremely versatile. thin material makes them hang correctly.  they have a lot of give for dancing and the style is very hip. a bit small but they stretch so i like them. a bit long but wareable. beautiful outfit just runs to small not for curvy women but material is just right looks just like the picture i find myself virtually living in these!  they\\'re very light weight, soft, so-o-o-o very comfy, and warm.  i wear them as pajamas, but if i\\'m not going out  in the morning i stay in them until something event worthy demands that i get dressed.  i often change into them after i\\'ve been out and about and revel in being home. i think they\\'re becoming an adult equivalent of a security blanket!  soft, soothing and comforting.  i\\'m wearing them now, in fact.  i think my family notices my attachment to these.  maybe i\\'ll get another pair for christmas! i haven\\'t worn them yet. i bought them for school but ended up going to a different school. they fit nice and the material seems normal for chino pants. these pants are made with a great material - not too tight, not too loose. i got them in long, and let me tell you, these pants are long. i\\'m 5\\'9\\\\\\\\\" and i had to fold them. i\\'ll probably get them in a regular length next time, but hey, i\\'m not complaining. it\\'s a luxury for tall girls to feel short in pants. vivian\\'s will be my go-to brand for fitness wear. these pants actually make you look thinner and fit like a dream.  they are so comfortable!! this is my second pregnancy and i had to get another pair because i love them so much.  they work for just running around town or to dress up and wear out.  absolutely the best black maternity pants out there! i wore them even after as they were so comfy.  the quality is also a lot better than many maternity clothes. i wore my first pair to work 5 days a week for the last 4 months of my first pregnancy and they still look good as new.  the only reason i got another pair is to have less laundry to do! i had some of the original ones from susan graver and qvc  and i loved them these trousers fit true to size and have an amazing drape. they are lined linen and with a wide cuff in case you need tailoring. great buy. good work pants.  a little stiff in the legs (but double thick knees, so to be expected), but i think that will break in nicely over time. comfy and attractive. you could wear them out to dinner with the proper top grate product. excelente the pockets are so large, you could feasibly put two moderate sized babies in them. four if they were small babies, like two per pocket. waistband is a little loose so i have to wear a belt so that the weight of all the things in my pockets doesnt pull them down--- i\\'m a size 32 pant for reference. i wanted these for myself. i wanted comfy, roomy pants that were light weight. this was exactly what i\\'d hoped for. my only issue is that the blue in the picture looked like a light, royal blue, but i got a dark blue instead. i actually liked this color just as much but it was very misleading. excellent! 100% recommended. materials, workmanship and superior design. excellent value for profit. i am very satisfied with the product purchased even officially licensed by hasbro, couldn\\'t believe it! love these pants. they are very comfortable. i ordered a large based on other reviews.  normally i would buy a medium or small in these pants but i purchased a large to be safe. i am 5\\'6 125  lbs and the large fit perfect but they are a little long even after washing. other then that i love them. ordered the dark grey color. wow, my husband loves these pajama pants more than any he has had. i have searched and searched for tall/long versions of soft knit pj bottoms and haven\\'t found any in two years (usually for every inch of length, you get and inch more of width which he doesn\\'t need). i\\'m ordering another pair right now, considering he hasn\\'t let me wash the first pair for two nights now because he wants to wear them! very soft and great long length for taller guys. 5 stars from me. love these pjs! so soft and great for summer i have a pair that were very old and faded but no longer manufactured.  these were an excellent gamble and i will definitely order more as my others age out! needed a pair of loose but good looking pants. post-abdominal surgery so i needed an elastic waist. they are polyester but good enough for work. don\\'t hesitate to buy them. these pants fit just as expected and the color is exactly what i expected. stretchy, green, look good, feel good. i love them. i have 6 pairs. they are my work pants. i bought my first pair almost 8 months ago i think, and they are just starting to tare a little on the inseam. loved them! will be ordering more daughter just loves them.  very soft a comfy.  would buy them again.  well worth the money  size was great too.  but don\\'t buy them as big as they said.  lol i bought these on the reviews advising of men\\'s sizing. aren\\'t as big as i was hoping for. afraid of shrinkage.<br />love the fabric and design tho. paired my leggings with a oversized sweater and knee-boots. made a great outfit. nice, well-made yoga pants. sturdy, soft fabric and they fit great.<br /> you would have to be just a little on the thicker side to have these not fit.<br /> would definitely recommend them (especially on sale...i got them for only seventeen bucks). the suit is quality, but the cut is a little lacking. if you want something on the contemporary side be prepared for a fair bit of tailoring. the legs are very wide for a 32 waist and the same thing for the upper jacket sleeves. that being said, the fabric has a nice feel and it could be worth the extra tailoring. met my expectations in every way. comfortable fit and warm fabric. just what i wanted<br />met the delivery date as promised this is s great upgrade from yoga pants. i can wear these anywhere. reece@roadrunner.com i\\'ve ordered three pairs so far. i can wear them on my walks and still look stylish. bought these for biking. i really like them, and i think they might help with visibility. i plan to wear them next time i go scuba diving too i am in love with these pants. i am plan to order more in different colors. i am 5\\'6-138lbs i chose a size medium and they fit great. these pants are more like jeggins than jeans, but still loving them. these were a gift for my husband and he loves them. they are very comfortable. these are the perfect palazzo pants, fit as expected! i mainly got them for my growing belly during pregnancy and they work great and are super comfy and stretchy. i would definitely buy these again :) great quality fabric! i will purchase another.  i think i purchase one size smaller.  love them! fit my tall eight year old girl well though she had extra room in the top.  very jingly! bought for my football loving 8 year old for christmas.  he begged for shoulder pads & a real helmet but that can wait for high school!  wears when he plays flag football with the neighbor kids.  they\\'re great quality so he\\'ll most likely grow out of them before he wears them out!  bought the small for my skinny son.  a tad big but he wears em anyway! i really like it a lot. it is super comfy and really cool looking. i am 5\\' 7&#34; and it fit great. these pants are great! well made and have a hidden bonus...no hemming needed! they have a built in velcro strip along each seam. just remove the fabric square from the bottom seam and fold it up to the length you need. stays in place very well- even through many many washings. be sure to save the square for when the full length of the pant is needed or the &#34;hook&#34; part of the velcro will catch on socks and scratch legs. the pants are slim fitting, which works perfectly for my tall skinny boy. the shirt (and free matching pants) came quickly and were of good quality. i was horrified when i first opened the package and saw xl on the lrg shirt i had ordered but it turns out that it was asian xl, american lg. i am very satisfied with the transaction.  frank a bit long (& i\\'m not petite), but very comfy. i bought this pants for my wife and she liked them. they look very very nice!!! arrived within 5 days after order was placed. my son is a 19 months old who wears 3t. perfect fit. length is long of course, for a 19 months old but because it was more like jeggings, it fit perfect w/out having to pin or hem. my son was an adorable olaf let me start by saying that i am over six foot tall. and for a girl that\\'s tall, so these pants are super long because they are long on me and i am not sure they can be hemmed up because of the string around the bottom of the leg. i love and everyone ask where i got them! they are nice cool. not a thick material. rock on... cant beat the price for the quality of fabric. i will buy these again for sure.<br />i really love them! great pants for the price. they seem to be sized appropriately and well made. really well made really comfortable best quality garmet i\\'ve purchased like this deff buying again ! hope one day they will make an even longer one ! read another review saying was really long i am 4&#34;11 and deff not too long ! when somebody reviewed these as a heavier material than expected, i was hoping this would be more substantial than they actually are. they are also more low rise than i like.<br /><br />my favorite pants to date are the old navy rockstar jeans. the black ones in particular are a perfect material: totally stretchy and comfortable, and they fit all body types according to a saleswoman, and to my observation this is true. if only the colored rockstars were as good as the black, i wouldn\\'t need any other pants! these pants are soft, comfortable, they fit great with room to shrink in the wash, and they take me back to my childhood. i dare you to regret this purchase. i am not short and these pants were very long on me . i have 4-6 more inches in length than needed. fits tight at the top and are loss at the bottom just how i need them i dance in these and they are really good also brings out the curves in your hips nice soft comfy and looks good.. love them they are very comfortable this jumper is super cute. light weight cotton, perfect for the summer!!! ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°i tried them on as soon as i got them and they fit perfectly.  im 5 ft 9 and i love that they are baggy and flowy. i can see myself living in these come summer they really do make your butt look amazing!  i am ordering 3 more!  i can tell these are going to be one of my favorite things to wear. i have always had a hard time finding yoga, dance or active wear pants that are long enough, i am 5\\'10 and usually most exercise pants are floods. these pants are fantastic. finally a long, boot cut pant that\\'s low to mid rise. i love them i will order more. i gave it 4 starts out of five as there was a hole in the material. i wont hold it against them, this time. they fit pretty good around the waist area.. since i am 5\\' 9&#34; and i have long legs, they were just a tad bit short for me.. i need an extra long.! very good for the price. (i got the yellow band in small, and it was only $5.99) fits well and is very comfortable. it didn\\'t have any weird smell after i took it out of the package. it attracts lint and fuzz which can be pretty noticeable on black pants but it\\'s not a problem for me. a lint roller will help with that. it shipped the next day and was delivered very quickly. thanks! my daughter is almost 6 years old and has never stayed dry over night. we have been spending hundreds of dollars a year on throw away night time pants. we decided to try something that was more like underwear thinking this may help her think she was wearing underwear therefore not want to pee in her pants over night. the first night she wore them she stayed dry over night!! i do believe some of bedwetting may be linked to them wearing a \\\\\\\\\"diaper\\\\\\\\\" to bed. the second night she did pee a little but they didn\\'t leak.  the only reason why i didn\\'t rate it 5 stars is because of the sizing. i ordered two diff. sizes the 6 and 8 thinking if the 6 was too small the eight would fit. the eight is really snug so i am ordering some 10\\'s. i\\'m absolutely in love with these leggings. they fit perfectly in every way and have a nice shine to them. i usually have issues with leggings being baggy in different areas but don\\'t have that issue here. i usually wear 00-0 (24&#34; waist). nice item i got these pants to show how much i love my country when i go to canada. gotta make sure they know who\\'s in charge. i was surprised they were shorter, even for me at 5\\'4&#34; but great style, very skirt-like. i am a size 2-4 and the small was perfect. i almost listened to previous reviews and went with a m/l because it stated they were smaller than size, they are not if you order your &#34;true&#34; size. comfy and cute! awesome halloween costume! best realistic skeleton leggings i could find! this is my second pair, both have been great fits and have washed well, hung to dry and no colors have faded! this helps my little angle stay warm at the bus stop for school and going places plus this will be a great gift i bought this set for my wife and this is what she had to say,    first of all, i am incredibly impressed with the quality.  the colors are vibrant, and the article is well made.  in the past, i have worn your products to outdoor reenactments, which can be rough on clothing, but i have never had a problem with your clothing.  moreover, i most certainly plan to buy more in the future.  it is an unbelievably good deal. the fit is good.  i have an unique build and usually have difficulty finding clothes that fit well, but this is not a problem i have with your products.  i have always been satisfied with the fit. overall, i love your products.  they are incredibly comfortable and make me feel sexy, which is a win win these are my favorite work pants! they are form fitting and cute! perfect for work and school! i will definitely buy more in the future! great, heavy weight sweats.  well made, good quality, minimal shrinkage in the wash, good color retention, good sizing, nice length. the material is more like a workout material, but they are very cute. i was used to buying sb brands unisex scrub pants at walmart.  since i wanted 3 pairs, i decided to search the internet.   three pairs of salus scrub pants including the standard shipping charge (which was sent by usps priority mail to my po box) was cheaper than buying three pairs sb scrub pants at walmart.  furthermore, the salus pnats are much better quality than the sb pants:  salus pants are 60% cotton/40% polyester, while sb pants are only 35% cotton/ 65% polyester.  salus pants also have thicker material.       however, note that:   a) the drawstring looks like a 1/2 inch wide shoelace with open ends.  from experience, you need to tie a knot at each end to prevent this type of string from fraying or coming apart over time.    b) other reviewers mentioned problem with sizing.  i have skinny legs and these pants look only slightly baggy on me.  however, the waist for the medium size is huge, so i have to use the drawstring and just pulling on the two ends is not enough.  i have to squish some of the material in front of the pants with my fingers as well as pull on the drawstring to get a tight fit around my 33\\\\\\\\\" waist.     overall, i am highly satisfied with these salus pants.  it was a super buy for me. as a big guy who doesn\\'t like his pants dropping below his ass, nor do i wear my pants up to my armpits, the waist tie is what drew me to this product. it\\'s not just a simple string that after a few times of cinching the waist tight will break inside (or outside) the waistband (a big, big irritant for me), it is almost like a belt, and of much better quality than a simple string. the only reason i dropped a star is because of my personal preference... it has nothing to do with the quality or construction of the pants, as they‚Äôre both tops, but it‚Äôs because of the design. as i said, i‚Äôm a big guy, but since when did clothing designers think that since i‚Äôm a big guy that the diameter of my ankles would match the diameter of my thighs? c‚Äômon - i\\'m all for fashion, etc., but i don‚Äôt really need my sweatpants to make a bell bottomed fashion statement... nor do i need them to make a skinny pants fashion statement... there has to be some happy medium when designing the taper of a pants leg, don‚Äôt ya‚Äô think? i really wish clothing designers would find that happy medium, too. it\\'s a very good product, so i\\'m not trying to dissuade anyone from buying them... this is more of a gripe at the designers of clothes that big guys might choose to wear. get the legs right! fits good sentthat\\'s good set its small on the length. but other than that it fits fine. the best clothes i really liked the product for it\\'s price. it\\'s cotton which is pretty soft and i liked that. i am normally a medium-small or 8-10  and ordered a medium in case and it fits well, i\\'m pretty sure a small could also fit so it\\'s up to you to decide. the length is also good. i am happy with my purchase, thanks! we had this set in size 24 months when my daughter was almost 2 year old and she loved it. she used it for a long time. now she is almost 3 and we couldn\\'t find it is size 3t, so i ordered size 2t just to give it a try and it fits her. my daughter normally wears size 3t, so it means this set runs a little too large. i love these shorts because of the bright colors and flirty balls that dangle. the quality is exactly what you\\'d expect being so cheap but they are so adorable! i am 5\\'3 and normally wear size 5 or 7 in jeans/pants and i am so glad i ordered a large! fits perfectly and a tad high wasted, exactly what i wanted! good buy for the price they fit larger than i expected, i should have got a small. but they are very comfortable and i didn\\'t even feel like taking them off. they\\'re roomy with large pockets, big enough to fit a large phone. overall, they were worth my money and i love them. these yoga pants are constructed very well. i like the material but the small (which is usually my size in other brands) was too small. i want another pair but don\\'t know which size to order. i have used these for nighttime wear for a couple of weeks now. the padding is absorbent enough to catch a minor accident before i can get my preschooler up for the potty. i plan to order more! the pants are nice. they fit my daughter well and they did not look cheap.  the colors are bright, and they hold up well when washed. actually much nicer than i expected. they are sweats but with the cargo pants design you don\\'t feel shabby going anywhere wearing them. one criticism: the velcro on the pockets is a little weak, and the string lock on the ankles also a little weak. overall well worth the price and i plan  to buy more. def a eye opener they catch people attention fast for my daughter, of course. quite lovely and comfy! these are very comfortable to wear around. i would very much recommend them. these slacks can be dressed up or down and are perfect for business attire with sweaters, blazers and tops of all kinds. i\\'ve gotten them for my daughter, in every color i could find them, and she is very happy with them. there are several other styles of motherhood maternity pants, including a denim that she really likes for casual wear. in addition, other sellers offer this bi-stretch suiting fabric in other colors.<br /><br />she thinks they show wear after a bit, with some fabric pills and loss of crispness, so she really takes care of these! fortunately, the price is reasonable enough that between the two of us, we have gotten her several pair in a couple of the colors. the large size fits her like her pre-pregnancy size 12 in the thighs and seat. she usually wears them with small or medium heels and the length is right for her 5\\'7&#34; height and average leg length.<br /><br />i never realized how difficult it was going to be to assemble a business maternity wardrobe! it was such a relief for me to find a brand that i know is comfortable for my daughter, fits her well and makes her feel good about her appearance, for a good price. i love it it even gave me an ass cause i don\\'t have one it shape me very well could not ask for more the fit was good but the pants weren\\'t the length i like (just needed a little longer). love these leggings! they are a perfect fit and not sheer in the booty area at all like a lot of other place\\'s are. ;) coming back for sure super awesome! the waist band was a little weird and it doesn\\'t stay up very well. it\\'s kind of like an elastic shoe lace i guess...if you\\'re looking for something to work out in i wouldn\\'t get these. these are more like a \\\\\\\\\"throw on, run errands, go to class\\\\\\\\\" type of legging. they look good with boots and really anything. they are comfortable and not see through at all, though they are not all that thick. worth the 8 dollars i paid! i got a medium and they fit like a glove. i am 5\\'4\\\\\\\\\" and about 140 lbs and they came to my ankles but i could pull them further if i wanted to. warm and fuzzy! perfect fit..nice sheen..a little thin but good for the summer. i am 5\\'5\\\\\\\\\" 200 lbs and i purchased the large. comfortable fit and it can be dressed up or down...love it!!! the only dissapointment was that they did not have my six which was a size extra small. other than that ithey were perfect. i was skeptical as it looked so tiny.....i ordered an xl due to the sizing guide (i\\'m normally size 8 - 10  medium) but it is very stretchy & looks very flattering on......i\\'ll be ordering more!!!! i live in a very hot climate and these are so lightweight i bought two pair...i wear them all the time! i love these pants, i always look skinny (to me) when i am headed to the gym and don\\'t feel lumpy anywhere.  also, i bought a size up when i got pregnant and it was so comfy and supported my belly better than most maternity clothes.  it was nice to not have the weight of the baby pulling down/ stretching my skin i love these pants. they are so extremely comfortable. i am seriously considering getting another pair because i\\'m going to wear these out. they are a bit long but i like them that way. i\\'m 5\\'6 and about 150 and the large is perfect. i think their very flattering. they fit better than perfect!! the price is unreal. this kind of quality usually costs at least 5 times as much at discount stores. excellent product and quick shipping adorable! great product these were the only underpants that i could find in an 18 mo. size.  they would stay up on my thin little 3 year old son.  i am so grateful that gerber sells underpants in a size smaller than 2t/3t so that he could have big boy underpants.  they\\'ve been great and my little guy is now potty trained. :) these yoga pants are soft and comfy to wear. the fabric is thin and pliable for ease of movement - what is really great is the length!!! i\\'m 5\\'10\\\\\\\\\" tall and these pants are about 2-3 inches longer than most yoga pants!!! as a tall woman, it is nice to have long, tall yoga pants!!! namaste good fit and function. i had knee replacements a few years ago and hated wearing uncomfortable knee pads. these allow me to do all the handyman jobs i need to do in comfort with no knee pain. i purchased this hat for my son and he absolutely loves it!<br />i was having trouble finding hats that fit him since he has a pretty large head for a baby. i\\'ve washed it several times and it has held up very well. overall, its a great hat for the price! fits really well and super soft great colors, handy pockets, drawstring comfort, simple to care for and i never want to put on anything else! if only all slacks were so comfy. they are very comfortable for walking or just hanging out. love them. thanks a real bargin for the zumba ladies out there.  they are nice and light weight and fit beautifully.  i recommend them like them but they come really long in length. fast shipping, arrived quickly and fit exactly as expected. these are great leggings for lounging around the house or sleeping in, as the knit fabric is soft and breathable. i also love how unique these are ‚Äî i\\'ve never seen any other star wars branded clothing for women like these! i highly recommend these! so comfy the fit is exactly to size chart so if you have hips make sure you check your measurements this is just adorable.  well made.  very happy with my purchase. great pants it took a week and three days for them to arrive. they are authentic and came with the little card. the pants are comfortable and stylish. the zipper pockets have the fire pattern instead of the money as expected. i can\\'t wait until winter so i can wear them! the only drawback is no pockets within the sweatpants. these are perfect. motherhood, old navy, and liz lange are the most comfortable maternity clothes. i\\'m glad that i didn\\'t have to send them back or worry about taking them up! great hiking pants if you are looking for cool and comfortable summer pants, these fill the bill.  the cotton gauze fabric is feather-light and you barely know you are wearing them.  caution:  as with many cotton fabrics, these do shrink a bit (maybe an inch or so), so be sure to wash them in cold water before you adjust the length.  they are available in several colors.    the quality is very good, comparable to other cotton gauze pants that cost two or three times as much.    excellent value! this is an ideal way to dress nicely but still be comfortable.  these wash well, are inexpensive, and wear quite well.  they seem to run a little large, so maybe go for the smaller size if you\\'re questioning between two.  i\\'m on my way to buy more in different colors! i am 5\\' 8&#34;, with long legs and wear a size 12 - 14 or l - to xl. the fit is very well, but because i have very long legs, the pants could be an inch or two longer for me. to me, these pants are a great buy. so far, my only other option always were about $85 on up, or so. somebody was worried about these pants being see through. i bought the black and purple ones and can\\'t say that they are. i don\\'t know about the red ones, since they are the lightest color offered.<br /><br />i would definitely buy them again. can\\'t beat the price. love these! ordered these after reading some of the reviews and couldn\\'t be happier! i am on the short side (5\\'3) so they are a tad bit long but i plan to do an easy hem on them. i really like the material and the fit is fantastic. i have more of an athletic/curvy body and they fit great. im normally a 4-6 and the m in these was perfect for me! will be ordering more saw some reviews before purchasing this item to see what had to be said especially since i run a little bigger on the bottom half of me, i have hips that run about 42.5 inches but these pants fit perfectly! the fabric is thin but very comfy and the length of the pant legs were perfect for my 5\\'1 stature. loved them! the pants are gorgeous, but sadly they didn\\'t fit in the hip area.  i have to remember that i normally purchase pants with some stretch in them, which these don\\'t have. love this items is so comfy had lots of nice compliments service excellent with this seller will be back.<br />big thank u i keep coming back to order more. i bought them for latin dancing but i started wearing them every day to avoid panty lines. i\\'m 5\\'9 and 140 lbs. they are comfortable, stay put, and fit well. my only complaint is that there is no panty lining and the rise is about an inch too high for me. but it\\'s the best rise i could find. the 6.5 inch ones were way too short- i gave them to my seven-year-old to wear. i purchased on a whim but i really do like these pants very colorul picture doesn\\'t sistort or fade when i wear them fit is nice and comfy and seams arent out right visible, will purchase again delivery wasnt long came in bout a week my son is two and 38\\\\\\\\\" tall and these are pretty big on him,  but they serve their purpose. we already have two sets of the gerber training pants and just wanted different designs, i would definitely recommend both for the beginning stages of the journey of potty training. not sure how it fits yet b/c it is wrapped under the christmas tree...the pants look a little large around the waist. we will see at christmas exactly how well they fit. material feels nice though. i love these pants! they fit perfectly, they\\'re soft and of great quality and very comfy. i want to wear them every day! pants are awesome, but be ready to change your phone number if you don\\'t want to receive daily calls from vanilla ice asking for his pants back, he can get pretty nasty. best worn with high top reebok sneakers. so i\\'m 5 foot tall and 120 lbs and usually wear size small pants.  i\\'m telling you this because these pants fit me perfectly.  they aren\\'t too long, they aren\\'t too big and baggy, they aren\\'t too tight, they\\'re perfect.  and super comfortable.  the stretch material is fantastic.  i have no idea how these things will fit on someone who wears leggings in anything larger than a size small though.  i love them, but you may not. i have a big booty and was concerned about the fit. works well. .i enjoy wearing the pant. slightlyssurprised. just wish the pants made me sweat like the garbage bag type pants.  but good buy. fit\\'s well and soft fabric. a tad tight.  but maybe it\\'s me! üòÄ these pants are incredibly comfortable and fit great (i am a small/medium framed male). there is one pocket on the right side. colors are the same as the picture, but the design is slightly different. received it in a few days after ordering. love \\'em. got this for my son who is an xbox junkie..i\\'m the best mom in the world...it\\'s a little small..so order one size up i am tall. i have a 34\\' inseam. i am not a small person (typically wear an xl) so i expected the 2x to be a little big on me. they are not.  they fit fantastically... which made me sad that i fit so well in a 2x.  but i do believe they run small. the most important thing is that they are soft and comfortable and they truly are extra long! i would say they run about a 35\\' inseam, maybe longer. they quickly became my favorite yoga pants and i plan on buying a few more.  well worth whatever price i paid for them. soft, comfortable with just the right amount of cling.  a little long but most pants are on me.  love them.  i would love them in gray and navy but my size was unavailable when i ordered.  i will try again. lightweight cotton pants.  the 24 month size fit a little big on our average-sized 24 month boy. so pleased exactly what i was looking for. washed well did not shrink and fit my son perfectly i love these, but wish they were available one size smaller.  i am normally an xs, but they did not offer these in an xs equivalent.  i ordered the asian l.  the quality, stretchiness, thickness and everything is far better than what i expected.  i will keep these and keep looking to see if they offer in a smaller size. not really meant for running errands but to sleep in or work out in just so comfortable. totally worth the purchase. excellent quality i love these pants. i worried about them not being able to fit. however, they fit, great. the material is soft and the shipping was fast!! received today .. christmas eve... satisfied .. other than the color being a bit darker than showed .. love them great yoga pants! these pants hug your body just right and are so comfortable. they also shipped in a timely mannor. yay for feel good apparel! these are awesome quality, long and hugging curves in all the right places. love it love them good!!! warm i love french toast products, their shirts fit perfectly but their pants are just a little large but it is easily solved with the adjustable waist. these pants and shirts have held up with many washing no fading or shrinking, the shirts did shrink just a little bit in length but nothing major! i am very pleased! i ordered these and i got them in the mail today they are absolutely wonderful and i love them i recommend i wasn\\'t sure what to expect from the fit of these capri but boy i sure am glad i purchased them. they can be worn for casual or dressy, will be ordering from this company again. fits well, nice material and colors, a little late shipment but fits to women nice...colors are ok, must fit any women tall or short very pleased with these pants,...they are long in the leg which is what i prefer,...ideal for relaxing around the house but if you need to run to to the convenience store they are fine,... however, it runs small and too short for me.  i\\'m 5\\'9&#34; very cute i\\'m a size xl, so i ordered the extra large and they fit great! very comfy and nice soft material. i\\'m glad there sizes didn\\'t run small! even if they did shrink some in the wash they look like they would still fit! i love the fit on these pants. there\\'s some stretch, but not too baggy. they are a little long (i got the medium) but i am a bit short so i expected as much. overall a great product. good fit. good price. will be getting another pair again soon. we bought these for my mother in law, still cheaper then the catalogue we saw them in. she says they are very comfortable, and adorable fits great and it meets all my expectations i love it i\\'m 5\\'10, 173lbs, slim, and 31 inch waist.  medium was a good fit for me.  material was thinner than expected but it still does a good job in the cold. i love it! i have small grand children an bought these an cloth diapers for emergency storage.<br />no problems i can see. thanks good so far...only washed once just a little too long, but that is to be expected because i have relatively short legs. these pants are very comfy. they may be a little see-through in the right lighting, or i may have bought a size too small. regardless, i love them and will be buying more. pants are the correct size. comfortable. the material quickly loses the color and shape. for that kind of money is not a very good purchase, but i still love the usmc sweat pants. these definitely run big, but i didn\\'t care that much. i just rolled up the pant legs. i bought the 6-9 month size and my daughter (who is average height for her age) is 15 months old and they fit perfect now. these are soft, but they are not thinsulate leggings. so if you are looking for leggings with patented thinsulate in them, this is not them.<br /><br />product title is quite misleading. the pants are loose fit meaning they don\\'t fit like running tights but you feel the spandex so you have the tighter fit you want in a running pant.  the bottoms are more flared than i wanted but still ok. she runs the twins around on weekends and need items like these that she can just wash, hang and go.  these were perfect for her.  she has long legs and hate her pants to bee too short.  fit great...she wore them before they were even washed. very comfortable but some what mall i am 5ft 7in. 120lbs. size small fits perfect for me. they are stretchy and very comfortable. i am happy i ordered these and got them so quickly. very cute leopard print. these yoga pants are super comfy and i love love love the fact that they are long enough.  i can never find young pants that are long enough. i want these in every color! so cute with a sweatshirt and uggs or sneakers.  the material is not super thick but i\\'m happy with them. these are a &#34;for sure recommend&#34;.  :) except for being just a little undersized in the thighs, and the back pockets being just a bit too shallow for securely closing over a wallet, these are good pants. they are workable as is, but could be excellent. love them  (perfect) came on time zz i had originally purchased the gerber training pants in a 2t for my daughter, but her weight is right on the border for the end of 18 months and the 2t size i bought. the gerber 2t would stretch out and slide down so i began looking at some other options.  i bought the smaller sized gerber (18 months) and also these in a 2t since their sizing chart is different (2t is 23-28lbs and 3t is 29-32lbs).  the cotton is nice and soft and the leg openings are comfortable, but the best part for us was the waist fit really nice for her. no sagging or bunching. since my daughter is thin, it may be better to go up a size if your child is not that that slim, would be my only suggestion. i will certainly continue to buy more of these. great product, great delivery i like them alot, and if you dont want the chains on there you can easily take them off but if your short like me you gotta be careful because the length on them they can tear really easily on the bottom looked good, kinda thin but perfect for az like the thick band, fit is great around my waist and thighs, and they are nice and long like i enjoy my pants. great buy awesome!!!!! very comfortable love these shorts! they stretch and fit well, don\\'t let my butt hang out, and are very comfortable. these are thick enough to absorb a small accident but she thinks she is wearing big girl underwear. she is very good about telling me she has to go with these on and hardly ever has accidents; unlike the pull ups. she knows they are a fancy diaper so if she is busy she will pee like its a diaper. these pants were longer than a typical preemie size (which is the size i picked); the length for this size is more like 0-3 months size.  however the waist was perfect for a preemie.  the fabric is thin and breathable and soft.  i would totally buy these again or recommend them to anyone else.  they will last my child awhile as she grows into them lengthwise. fits perfect and looks good on me. nice and warm excellent, comfy, love it! warm and comfortable.  the size was right on the mark. the fit is perfect. the color is good and the pants are incredibly comfortable. i will definitely be ordering another pair. love these, the fabric is nice, the length was long which i needed, and fit great i forgot i had them. will try them soon... wonderful pants.  they are very comfortable, especially for the petite frame.  these pants are a definite addition to my collection office clothes. great product, and easy to use. have 2 now, and after a bunch of washings on my favorite jeans, it lets me keep wearing them. joggers are ankle length not knee length i love them. i wear size seven or nine jeans, and i bought the small. they fit well. slightly large(they are men\\'s sweatpants after all). i washed and dried them, and they shrunk to the perfect size. definitely recommended. feels good, runs small i bought them in january for a winter trip to denmark and ended up wearing them nearly everyday. they are so comfortable and warm--but not too hot. luckily i\\'m able to wear them to work and they look great with boots and flats. nice pair of pants they are a great buy for the price. very cute....silky feel and thin but doesn\\'t show your skin.thx! fit perfectly and love it....... great product. only disappointment was it was a bit large for me. i wanted to go running in these and the two legs seem to tough against each other which was a bummer. otherwise its great and nicely does its job of keeping your legs warm in the winter. these pants are so comfortably and looks really cute.  the flared leg is great for a little hippiness on us girls.  great buy. these work pants hold up well. as a tailor i am impressed with their wearing well through multiple washings & also looking professional for my husband\\'s job as a grocer. fits like a glove only a bit too long.  other than that it size 14 fit beautifully very nice pants. they look like work pants, so will be good to wear to work or to work out in! nice material, not see-through at all. i dig em! very roomy and comfy, they go with everything, bought in several colors, they run large should have gone with smaller size but all good my seamstress took them in where i needed it fit as expected. fabric great and pants comfortable and not see through! i convinced my husband to try some \\\\\\\\\"manpris\\\\\\\\\" (3/4 pants) for our vacation to the middle east. we were visiting some religious sites where our knees had to be covered. he was hesitant. but once he tried these on, he loved them! we purchased two pairs. the fabric is lightweight, but durable. he now has a total of 5 pairs of 3/4 pants that he has been wearing all summer. i wonder if he will ever wear long pants again!? purchased for my wife - she loves them i bought these for an 80\\'s party we are having and they are perfect.  sure, they are a little on the smaller side but they will work fine.  i\\'m a size 12 and they are snug, but they\\'ll work.  i knew i was purchasing from overseas where the sizes differ from the us.  i am very happy with my purchase. got the xl and fits great (i\\'m a 31 waist size but muscular), has nice room at the top but is snug at the bottom giving a great tapered look. you can unzip the bottom parts if you can\\'t get your legs in easily. love the colors but bump up at least a couple sizes they run small comfortable beautiful fabulous fit,  fun color, good price.  not quite sure what to say in here to use up 14 words.  i bought their smallest size that fits like a glove. they fit perfectly<br /> nice and shiny<br />will buy more pairs now perfect. before giving a talk i asked a couple of colleagues if these pants looked too casual with a shirt and tie. they said they looked fine. these days, functionality trumps, and these pants look as good as khaki chinos. would they work with a jacket? maybe not now, but in the future everyone will wear functional pants for devices. they shipped fast and looked liked the picture. they fit like i expected them to. i got a small even though i have a bigger but than the model for the shorts and they made my butt look nice comodo these pants fit true to size.  a great exercise pant. they make you look good (slimming). very comfortable to move in. i\\'ve ordered 3 pairs. will order more. i wear them to work or lounge. xxl. sz 18/20 5\\'4 and loose. legs are super wide. white ones will require leggings underneath totally see through. perfect for summer. love! i really like these.  they fit my 5\\'8&#34;, 140 lbs perfectly and feel great.  i am going to order another pair in a different color. this pair of pants turned out to be better than i expected!  they fit good and look great... not to mention the great price!  i bought two more pair in different colors. i love cropped pants and these are just the right ankle length. the material is nice and soft and they\\'re very comfortable. every time i wear these capris i get commented on how cute they are.  they fit well, are comfortable and go with just about everything.  they are a &quot;must have&quot; in my wardrobe! i was totally worried about getting this product. i keep reading all of these reviews about buying clothes from china and most of them are really bad.<br />the ones that are good seem fake. it seems like the companies pay people to write bs reviews.<br />so i would go back and forth like a paranoid nutbag, stalking the reviews &#34;should i buy this?&#34; &#34;should i not?&#34;<br />eventually i decided to take the gamble.<br />and i\\'m glad i did.<br />it it not cheap looking, the material is substantial, it fits just right. it\\'s cute, and looks perfect if you add a belt. i can\\'t wait for it to warm up so i can wear it instead of just looking at it in my closet. fits right and well made. we love this. my daughter loves yoga pants and was quite pleased with the fit and quality of these pants. i will order more. a little too big for newborn, but super soft. just couldn\\'t put them over onesies...had to put them under them. the fabric of these pants is very forgiving.....they make your booty look good! they came early and they are really cute but they are really shinny and glossy its almost like a icing on a cake color. and they are see through a bit. i got these as a birthday gift and i love them! they are so comfy to wear around the house. i even do yoga in them sometimes, though they are a little on the loose side for that. i tend to wear a woman\\'s xl and the men\\'s l fit great. fabric is very soft and just a little stretchy. the run a little long- but that\\'s probably bcs they are men\\'s wear. very comfortable, has jean pockets, but is a jersey material. satisfied with fit, looks cute, but doesn\\'t pass as &#34;jeans&#34;. these pants are super comfy, and i get a ton of compliments. they\\'re super soft and made of a thin jersey material, but because of the pattern, you can\\'t see through them and they hide the bad stuff. love them! loove love love! cute stretch leggings for those peppa the pig lovers. but the material is thinner than expected. however, worth buying for the &#34;novelty&#34; of peppa.<br />reasonably priced. they are okay for training,  but you still get a little leak.  however,  each child is different and i think they are worth the try for your child. love it. happy with my purchase. i was worried they wouldn\\'t fit, but they are just great. perfect for the world cup! an elastic waistband and cool feel to the cloth make this one of the best purchases i\\'ve made. totally comfy and definitely unique, i\\'ll be buying more soon! so comfortable and great for work and the gym, i love the length as well, nice and long, the purple is my favorite color too comfy, cozy, great price. took a while to arrive, but they\\'re great! i get that people come in all shapes and sizes but the length of these pants in size xl are for someone over 6\\' tall, too long for the average person. they fit well, more like leggings than pants though. i got a large and they aren\\'t really all that loose, but the fabric feels really soft and they look great!<br /><br />also, pockets are always a plus! perfect fit & good quality i was absolutely nervous about the fit of these leggings just like the rest of you. as soon as they arrived i tried them on & they fitted perfectly! i gained quite a few pounds over the summer so i wasn\\'t sure what size to get. i\\'m 5\\'2 currently weighing 155 lbs. so i went ahead & got my leggings in a size large. they are so comfortable & breathable. i absolutely love them & i wouldn\\'t mind buying some more. i agree with the reviews that say they love these pjs.  i love them too cuz they are super cute and super soft.  i thought the size was good. these harem pants are so great! they look amazing with booties and most shoes and are the perfect high-wasted length to hear with a cropped top. pants are great as described, received on time . giving pants away as gift to my sister who loves to exercise. i\\'m sure she is going to love them! love these! they are comfy too i was surprised to find this particular color to be much less soft than the four others we own. i\\'m not sure if it was a different fabric blend this time or what, but they are a bit stiffer. i was so in love with this brand because of the footies and the incredible softness so one star off for the lack of softness on this pair. and strangely enough, the other pair i bought at the same time was super soft. oh well! they still look great and are super easy and comfortable for the little one. fit as described the fabric is so soft! ah i love these leggings so much! they fit perfect, no threads, the pattern is beautiful. my son loves them love them. a bit small but to be expected from any china made product. but very unique and would buy more in the future! i recently purchased a pair of these pants from x-bows and am completely satisfied with my purchase. <br /> <br />the quality of the pants is first rate, with solid stitching, top quality leather, and a heavy nylon zipper in the fly. i really like the \\'no seams\\' look of the legs. <br /> <br />i only found one thing that i needed to change with these pants, and that was the addition of two more belt loops near the fly opening. the pants as shipped had seven belts loops arranged from the mid point of the waist on each side around the back. there were no belt loops from the mid point around to the front. i have a friend who is a seamstress with a leather machine so it was no problem for her to add a couple of more belt loops. <br /> <br />other than that, great service from x-bows, shipped without delay, and a very satisfied customer. my daughter loves these!! thick stockings, nice and warm ! this is a perfect fit.  i like the slightly heavier material in the rib runner as compared to the un9 cotton long john.  the rib runner fits great and is extremely comfortable under my jeans on extremely cold days and holds everything in place just right.  this is a very well designed long john.  i would recommend it to anyone. pants fit perfectly and are exactly what i was looking for! i am climbing mt. fuji the first week of august and needed some reliable, comfortable pants to wear on the hike. they fit perfectly (i am 5\\'10&#34; and 180lbs), are very comfortable, and i anticipate that the liner inside will keep me warm while the outer shell will keep the rain and wind off of me. these were exactly what i was looking for.<br />thanks,<br />will the pants are a big more snug than expected but the quality is good and they were delivered earlier than scheduled. don\\'t understand the bad reviews. i ordered a small size when i was 130lbs. i have gained a few pounds and they still fit wonderfully, but i just barely for smalls at this weight. i\\'m 5\\'2 and a half and in love with these! this jumpsuit is cute!  i used them for whimsical clown like characters in a play and they worked fantastic!  these run small and they are best for tall lean people.  nice linen fabric.  these took several weeks to arrive in the us so plan ahead. these pants are so cool, i wear them as regural pants, waist band is the best i\\'ve seen in yoga pants because it lays flat and stays in place and doesn\\'t bunch up like most yoga pants know it will fit, gorgeous color, exactly as pictured when purchased.  most outstanding is the short shipping time.  absolutely astounding! well made. got to me quick.packaged good. look and feel great.iam happy with this purchase.yada yada yada yada yada why do i have to leave a certain amount of words for a review? it is really good panties (good material and comfy). we did 3 day potty training for our daughter... used regular panties.  so the 9 training panties only got used once. love alfred dunner. thanks for making it possible to get them without having to go out to the store. always good quality nice pair of pants for price. i bought them for my 5&#34;5&#34; husband, who likes women\\'s petites because they don\\'t need an tailoring. he probably could have  worn a medium. love them.  fits peprfect. loved this! i love how it shapes out my curves! it snugs you tight but comfortable :) love love love it exellent what  great fitting pant. smooth front, elastic in the back. doesn\\'t shrink. doesn\\'t stretch out at the waist. be careful not to order the short unless you want it short. regular length just right. i\\'d recommend these to anyone in the potty training process!! they are a lifesaver to keep you from changing clothes!!! these are by far the best training pants! they\\'re so soft and very absorbent. definitely worth the extra money to splurge on these when you\\'re potty training a toddler. my daughter loves to wear them! easy to dance zumba in them. its so comfy and soft, exactly what i expected and even more, i recomend it :) fits perfect these cotton pants are luxuriously soft and very nice, but they do run large. my 12-month-old is a little tall for her age, and they are a bit big and long on her. the good thing is, they will fit her for quite some time.  update: my original review of these was written in april 2014. believe it or not, my daughter can still wear these! they now fit like capri pants, but they fit perfectly around her waist. her normal pant size is now 2t or 3t. that will give you an idea of how wide these are. i\\'m a girl who normally wears a size 14 pants. i bought the medium and they fit perfectly, also they are really soft, not to thick, and if you identify as a slytherin they\\'re pretty damn awesome very comfortable fit perfect!! love aa\\'s infant karate pants! so soft and love that the legs have room vs all of the tight leggings that are on the market right now for girls. looks good on a girl with a but skinny legs. the girl likes how they feel too.<br />it\\'s a good product overall. cute and super comfy i kinda dug these from the photo because - while not doing the whole steampunk thing - i totally dig the victorian-era explorer type wardrobe cues, and this fit the bill to a tee!  they go perfect with a knee high pair of riding boots i have or just by themselves with a lower boot.  and they were made in india! jodhpurs made in india!  and they are totally adjustable through the waist.  i friggin\\' love these! i do like it but it\\'s so small. it says 12-18 months but now my 9 months-old baby is already growing out of it<br />it is so soft and nice, i love the color i love it , quality good i\\'m 5\\'5 135 pounds and these fit perfectly they are very stylish and i recommend them 100 percent. must buy kittens with inverted crosses?  it\\'s like these leggings were made for me.  they\\'re a little cheaply made, but correlate with the price.  i can\\'t say anything bad about them.  i\\'m 5\\'6 and wear a size 1 or 3 in jeans, and these fit me perfectly. the pants fit well and are a great color.  i ordered one size larger.  this is my second pair in a different color. though i purchased these items a while back,i procrastinated with this review.  everything was very well made and extremely reasonable. i\\'d not hesitate to recommend the purchase of these lovely baby things.  the quality was excellent and the items were adorable. i was scared about the &#34;one size fits all&#34;, but as soon as i put them on they where awesome! great fit, stretchy and soft! i\\'m a 12-14 and i bought a pair for my daughter who is a size 8-9 and she loved them too! they fit just as awesome on her...i was shocked that they did. huh! who knew?  :) everything is fine except the garment is way too large, and i measured according to instructions i believe. sooo comfy and soft! the only reason i left a star out is because there was a hole in the crotch of the pants when i got them which i easily sewed up but i would rather not have to do something like that with something i just purchased. low price so no biggie. i\\'ve worn these a lot as they are my favorite lounge pants. the color of the loki graphic and stayed bright and hasn\\'t faded over several washes. they are light-weight, soft, and very comfortable. my daughter loves the fit and feel. these are extremely comfortable yoga pants and fit great! they are great for 2015 graduates or can be good for anyone else by simply rolling the waist down, or leaving it if you don\\'t mind the 2015. they are really cute also! i was hesitating after reading in one of the reviews that the fabric was too thin and the lady had to wear shorts underneath. not true. this is great quality and thick enough to endure cold weather. i were it to a day trip to nyc and it was cold - i was very pleased.  a little loose on the waist but everywhere else it was perfect. i\\'m also 5.10&#34;and the length was appropriate. i just got these pants today and im already inlove. i wasent sure at first whether they would fit right because i have a somewhat large butt, but they fit perfectly! definitely recommend this product to anyone curvy or with muscular thighs. i do not own this exact pair of alfred dunner elastic waist pants, but have others like it.  the material is well made and doesn\\'t \\\\\\\\\"fall apart\\\\\\\\\" with use or with routine washing (in cold) and drying (on permanent press). neither do they easily fade.<br /><br />the elastic waist is comfortable, and i prefer to have shirts that i don\\'t have to tuck in, anyway.  a tucked-in shirt or blouse with an elastic waist of any brand doesn\\'t look right, in my opinion.<br /><br />in alfred dunner pants, you will generally find you can size down. they tend to run a bit big.<br /><br />they also are shorter than the average.  (regular length is 29 3/4\\\\\\\\\", petite short is, i think 27\\\\\\\\\", and womens\\' petite is about 28\\\\\\\\\".  however, check the lengths on the part of the page that shows details about the pants.)<br /><br /> i have always appreciated that this company makes pants for the shorter women of any size.  few companies do, and they can be difficult to find.<br /><br />they have pockets in the front, and go well with coordinating colors/ patterns in shirts and blouses made by alfred dunner, but perhaps not available here.<br /><br />comfortable, casual pants, recommended. my cousin looked so handsome at a family wedding last week when wearing this. he loves the color blue and this shade was absolutely beautiful.  i highly recommend it! i feel so classy when i wear these. i really like these pants. the style is very cute and they are also nice and soft. i live in fl and they are perfect for our winter...not too heavy. if you live up north they may be a bit thin for a cold winter day. just started using them but seem like great quality for a great price. got these for mom for christmas, and she loves them. she literally tried them on and wore them for the rest of the day. she has already asked where i got them, how much they were, and what the brand name is and wants to get 20 more pairs. in my book, that\\'s a successful gift! i\\'ll probably end up getting a few myself! the fact that they\\'re in so many colors and so affordable is a major plus too! thanks cotton cantina!<br /><br />** (she\\'ll hate me for saying this, but mom is around 5\\'4&#34; and probably 120-130lbs and says the medium size fits great - for those of you confused about sizing. these leggings looks awesome because their color is very neat. the sad thing was that i am a little chubby for these legging (9) so they did not fit too well.  the fabric is good too.  i gave these to my little cousin and she absolutely adore them. my mom bought me these pants, and im usually a size 3 in pants unless they run small. previous reviews said these pants do so i got a size 5 and they fit amazing! they also make my butt look good, so that\\'s just a bonus =] i\\'m about a size 10, i ordered a medium and they fit like a charm. i ordered these on a monday and i received them thursday. i\\'m about to order different colors now! these are so comfortable, and look nice also. i\\'m ordering more in different colors. i also bought the juniors\\' xhilaration¬Æ knit gaucho pants, but they don\\'t have any elastic at the waist and fall off! so this style is much better. these leggings a nice but just wasn\\'t what i expected. they were delivered on time but they have more of a cloth feeling to them and there not tight along the waist, there loose due to &#34;fitting all sizes.&#34; wish they had pockets. still like them. fit as expected. these pants were gorgeous! so bummed they didn\\'t fit or have a bigger size. had to return them but haven\\'t gotten my refund yet. great tights. i wish the black was a little darker. the material is very thin and somewhat see-through, but otherwise they are very cute. looks good!! little bit large, my weight is 114 pounds, 5\\' 3. i like them, the only downfall is they are kinda see thru. im sure after i wash them they will be very see thru. but they fit as expected i got a medium and im am a size 8/9. a large would of been too big. i would buy them again in a different color! ok great fit very nice material n comfy..just too long..i am 5\\'2&#34; and had to have them hemmed! i got three pairs total, one for each of my boys, and they love them!  the fit is perfect and they are extremely warm. i rate it on my wife as it is very tight on hips and thighs. it gives a sexy look on the hips. the material is made of a very high quality. the size fits very well and it is comfortable. it is stretchy. the style fits for any occasion including everyday and work wear. love these pants! will purchase more in different colors. bought this pants for my wife and she loves it! we already purchased 3 more since! fits nice and comfortable, according to her! i can fit it, but it is very snug. the shorts are really nice and well made these run really small....buy the next size up from what you think you need. other than size issue the are well made. a little much to pay for baby pants that baby will grow out of so quickly, but soooo cute and very soft. can\\'t wait for my little guy to be born and wear them! a throw back from way back...my kid loves it they are really cute, but they need minor adjustments. the holes where the buttons go through, were sown shut, so i had to get a knife and cut through them myself.<br /><br />if you have somewhat of a medium-large behind, i recommend ordering a large because the mediums were not able to cover my entire booty, and the bottom of my booty were pretty vulnerable. which is the downside of most high waisted shorts.<br /><br />shipment was fast and they actually arrived earlier than expected.<br /><br />all in all, these are worth the buy :) i purchased four pairs of fleece pants, and am so glad that i did.  these pants are well made, soft and most important warm. my legs are always cold, and i especially wanted pants that would keep me warm, and these pants do just that.<br /><br />i am most pleased with my purchase, and i would highly recommend these pants. my 10 year old son\\'s team provided alleson pants which are so much less quality than the mizunos. mizunos clean up very well, even considering the fact the my sons\\' are white. soaking in a little simple green and it\\'s good bye to grass stains!! the alleson\\'s unfortunately were not the same to clean!!i could not get them clean at all. my son said that the mizunos were also so much more comfortable than any other brand that he\\'s tried (rawlings, wilson, alleson and all star) they are a little more expensive than other brands but i guarantee, it is so worth it! i\\'m going to tell all the other mom\\'s on the team to just use the alleson\\'s for practice and the mizuno\\'s for games. great quality for the cost, i know she wears them all the time. these aren\\'t jeggings, they\\'re made of a cotton knit, not denim, but they fit like them. they remind me more of the stretch pants you used to see in the 60s.<br /><br />i got them in black, i\\'m a size 8 so got a medium, and they fit great. i\\'m 5\\'9\\\\\\\\\" and they are plenty long enough. there\\'s a lot of stretch there so they don\\'t bind but they fit snugly and look terrific! great price. no problem would and will get some more, and my daughter likes also just have to pass the inside feeling of them. i absolutely love these pants! ! they fit me so well! and they are very stretchy which is great.it took less than a week for them to arrive.im a very satisfied customer and i would definitely recommend these fits great! bought for my daughter, she loves them! they are super comfortable and she can\\'t wait to wear them to dance i bought these for myself but my 24 year old daughter quickly confiscated them  they are fabulous i love absolutely everything this company makes!  these are the softest pajamas ever, wish they came in adult sizes! i purchased these leggings from go jane. i am very eased with the quality. the fabric is stretchy and very soft. i am petite and the small fit me perfect. i love the detail embellishments. i was very surprised how quickly they were shipped to my door. i would highly recommend these leggings as they are a real fashion statement! very stylish, my daughter loves the way the back pockets look. not sure how they will hold up, but at this point they look great! the pants are so nice, good quality, have washed them twice and they come out beautiful, i turn them inside out.  they ran a little small but not bad. i purchased the m/l they were more like a s/m nice pants! they fit but i would have like them to have more give! cool work out pants thank you i stand out when i work out makes me feel like a pro but i am not o well. these pants are great, nice soft material and though they are a little long (i\\'m 5\\'5&#34;) i definitely prefer that to being too short!  solid purchase, i will order more in different colors. very nice i emailed the seller and got a quick response about sizing, i\\'m 5\\'5\\\\\\\\\", 105 lbs and 24\\\\\\\\\"-36\\\\\\\\\" (so always have a hard time finding pants to fit both around the waistband and my butt!).  miri suggested i get these in a size small and they fit perfect.  they are a little long for me but the fabric is thick enough that they stay rolled to the inside if i\\'m not wearing them with heels. these fit great and look ultra cute i am 5\\' 6 1/2&#34; 138 pounds and this is a perfect fit<br /><br />very comfortable not too baggy wore to a dance class & out shopping.  love the high waist so i could wear a cute crop top without showing my middle... need to have a little modesty going on üíÉüèª i like them, but the waist band gets very easily twisted, which is annoying. i wish the skirt was about an inch shorter, but overall i like it. sizing is weird i wear a 14 short in pants and got the 3x and it\\'s a little big wow... i love them. perfect fit , comfy, not to thin not to thick, very good for working out, i am old school and i love the stile, i was afraid of some review i read, but i cant see true and its not cheap quality... i am absolutely happy ,and every bodybuilder will be too, i will buy more for sure.... make sure c500 model... they seem to hold out rain well.  they fit as described for waist size, but the length is a little short.  they are adequate if you are only standing up, but even then they could be just a touch longer.  if you are in a seated position they really slide up the leg too high to be effective.  they will keep everything that they cover dry very well.  they even seem more durable than i expected.  i am about 5\\'9&#34; tall with a 34 to 36 inch waist depending on the brand of pants.  the boots that i wear are waterproof and so i stay dry, but i would recommend that you cautiously calculate the sizing chart to see if these pants will do what you want.  i considered sending them back for the next larger size but figured that is just as much of a gamble.  buying clothing online is not an easy thing to do.  good luck if you decide to purchase these.  if they fit you well then you will be pleased with the purchase, but if not you may be disappointed. this pair for 17 is a bit overprice, however, it has lycra so it stretches! these pants are expected with the price paid. no more no less as picture shown. delivery was as expected noticed. panties do the job and aren\\'t too thick so the child can move freely. also they are pretty so she like to wear them i thought first that i don\\'t want to spend much money on maternity clothes, since i\\'d be only wearing them for a few months. after trying on countless pants at gap and target and being disappointed with the fit and quality, i decided that there is no reason for me to look and feel frumpy during this most exciting time in my life, and decided to splurge on a few key pieces that i would get a lot of use out of.<br /><br />halfway into my 2nd trimester when my normal jeans and pants started to become uncomfortable, i bought 2 pairs of ag pants (these and a pea in the pod collection: ag jeans ballad secret fit belly(tm) corduroy stretch fabric skinny boot maternity pants) and i couldn\\'t be happier with both! when worn with a long top or tunic, they don\\'t look like maternity pants at all but rather like my normal designer jeans. both are long enough for me (i\\'m a leggy 5\\'10\\\\\\\\\"), fit perfectly around butt and thighs (i normally wear size 28; ordered size 29 thinking that a little extra room might come handy in another few months. there is definitely some room for me to fill out if needed but they are not saggy at all) - and the long stretchy panel for belly is super comfortable. it\\'s still slightly loose (my belly is not that big yet) but i just wear a bellaband over it - and it\\'s great!<br /><br />i\\'ve been practically living in these pants the last few weeks and can confidently say that this was money well spent. highly recommended! meets my expectations of alfred dunner.  however, these pants are heavier than i expected and a little scratchier.  the color is as stated  chili.  this is the first time i have seen this color. it is definitely not an orange red, it it chili.  i love them and expect the material will soften with repeated washing. pretty but to small is as stated. noiseless, and mostly moisture-proof, but still leaks at sides for a patient that has enormous incontinence. nice, soft material. love these my 13 yr old daghter loves these pants. they are cool, light and comfortable. she wants some more in other colors. i took a bad fall, resulting 4 weeks in a wheelchair and 4 weeks with a walker.  i needed something that would stretch over swollen body parts, be comfortable, and look good for visitors.  these fit the bill.  they stretch where they need to, feel like pajamas, yet look like day wear for company.  bonus - they don\\'t pill!  win-win-win i bought these for my wife‚Äìher second pair. she likes them, and they look fine. they are a little thin and cold in cooler weather. the quality is great and they fit as expected for junior size. it cover all junior sizes, but not big sizes. washes well and the fabric is hight qulaity nice by far the best investment i\\'ve ever made! the sizes are true to number so be sure to measure yourself correctly. pant legs are a but long so be sure to wear a shoe that had a bit of platform to it. remember these pants have chains on them, so don\\'t expect to be sneaky or quiet, and finally be sure to remove the chains before washing, the best method is hand-washing so nothing is torn or split. awesome pants and an awesome seller! would defiantly buy from tripp again :) 1 have used this brand of diapers for 3 years with complete confidence. the training pants are of comparable quality. i especially love the tear away sides just in case of need to quickly remove. they are comfortable it seems-no complaints from toddler. the size and color are just perfect, it looks great and original, good gift ! as a bigger individual this belt fits me when i have it extended out all the way. i wear a size 46 in pants, so if you are bigger than that it probably wont fit you. product is as described and pictured. i have had this belt since december 2013 and the colors haven\\'t faded yet and the material has retained its shape. i would recommend it to anyone who likes naruto. great for throwing on after a tanning session. that\\'s what i bought them for and they work. is you are size small  get small. the material is stretchy. they really make you sweat. they run a bit on the large size though. the fit is a bit smaller than expected, but coming from hot topic, i\\'m not surprised. these are great pajama pants! i bought these as a gift, but i ended up keeping them for myself since they run a bit large. the waist is fine (the draw string is great) they\\'re just a little loose through the leg. this does mean that they\\'re super comfy! the fabric is a nice weight - it\\'s a fairly lightweight cotton, but they\\'re still heavy enough to keep me warm in the cold house. i\\'ve run these through the washer and dryer several times now, and there wasn\\'t any shrinking or fading. i ordered the white jacket and pants set to wear home on the airplane after my upcoming wedding.  i plan on adding a ‚Äúbead-dazzles‚Äù to the back of the jacket.  the material is great quality, it‚Äôs soft and the fit is very comfortable.  the jacket zips up without pulling too tight across ‚Äúthe ladies‚Äù and the pants fit well -not up to high like ‚Äúmom jeans‚Äù and not to low nearly exposing you know what.  and at this price for the set, is a steal!  loved everything about this! good quality - very soft i used these in conjunction with the waterproof pants while potty training my daughter.  it really helped to cut down on the messes that came along with her accidents! yes! i have to buy more of these! &#60;3 ordered the pants as a size 5/6 female emt hoping that these would fit. they were uncomfortably tight, and i was worried the size m male would be too large. asked the seller for an exchange for the women\\'s emt pants size 6 online and they were courteous and quick about the exchange, and the women\\'s pants are great! would recommend avoiding trying to size to a male equivalent and just ask armyuniverse for the women\\'s sizes. oh i love these and will save them forever! they are so soft and i have such wonderful memories in my little one in these... ill probably order more for her now that she is bigger... i highly recommend! i really like those. they\\'re so light and airy and comfortable. exactly what i was looking for. soft and long enough for tall 1 year old. very nice these teez-her pants have a wonderful feel, fit, and look.  the wide waistband is so comfortable!  in fact, they are comfortable all around; whether you are bending or sitting, they have just enough give to feel great. the fit is exactly right on me, and i expect they would fit anyone perfectly because they have the right amount of stretch. an advantage: they have no pockets to sag or bump, so they are always quite smooth looking. they hold their shape and wear well. i own them in all the colors available.  last year, there was a denim shade which i can\\'t find this year. so the only improvement i could ask for would be - more available colors, including that great denim. terrific pants! great fit and super comfy.  the quality of the stitching and the fabric in general is great quality.  for the price it is one of the best pants i have found. i love these pants. i pretty much live in this style of pant in the summer time. these are made of a really nice thin cotton. i machine washed them once. i got the red pants and everything else in the wash turned pink so i hand wash and hang them to dry. they dry pretty quickly due to the fabric. i\\'m planning on ordering a few other colors. i just wish this seller used amazon prime so i didn\\'t have to wait! so comfy!! i\\'m usually a size 8-10 in women\\'s pants and i probably wouldn\\'t recommend this &#34;one size&#34; product for people much larger than me, but they fit great. gorgeous colors, very soft, can\\'t wait to wear them all summer!<br /><br />that being said, the first time i washed them, i made the mistake of hand washing them in slightly cold water. they shrunk like crazy. this is completely my fault, as they\\'re clearly advertised as rayon and apparently rayon can shrink in cold water. i liked them so much and they\\'re such a great price i just bought a second pair, but definitely dry clean only. i like these a lot! i wish they were offered in more colors! great color! gave as gift.  they loved it. item arrived quickly and was overall as expected. the size did run a bit small but we ordered one size up and it was fine. 5 stars these work great for potty training. as long as you notice the accident within 5 mins. my son was sitting on the couch when he peed and it didn\\'t leak out on to the couch. they\\'re also great for in the car when you may not be able to stop in time. they look exactly like they do in the picture and they fit perfectly. they go great with shorts and boots. great purchase! they are a really good fit! as expected, not bad. it fits large but i don\\'t want to waist time so i just decided to use as is.  i went for a 3 mile walk and it worked - weather was not hot and i still was able to feel the sweat! great product and excellent seller i love this out fit. i also will be sending for 1 or 2 more. there are only a few colors to pick from. great quality size and the baby seems happy!! would buy again, my daughter liked them... goes with different tops types these are the best dance pants.  fit well with long legs that don\\'t shrink, and have a slight sheen to them, so they look much higher end than cotton pants.  not hot either, according to my daughter.  highly recommend. exactly what i expected. good, thicker material than most jeggings. looks like jeans. would recommend. love the material and very comfy too! the only thing bad about the pants is it doesn\\'t stretch much in the ankle part. other than that a great buy! great for plus size too. for a large its to small..i would order and extra large but then it would be to long. and , what does prime mean..let me know.<br />i would like a black one  and another grey but they are to expensive for me. very comfortable and super cute! love them, ran a little small these are amazing. i love the color, they fit great. i order a large, and in jeans i\\'m a size 10-11. they\\'re very stretchy. love, love, love -- the material very comfortable and the price is right!  i would recommend these to all my friends and family! my daughter loves her pants. she is super active and refuses to wear any clothing that constricts her movement, so she will only wear leggings or these pants. they run a little long in the legs, but that is perfect for my daughter. very comfy and good give in the waistline, but not too much. perfect for spring and summer weather around here (we\\'re in seattle), and easy for my toddler to pull on and off by herself as she\\'s learning to potty train. highly recommend. nice quality being a taller person myself, it\\'s kinda hard to find sleep pants that actually go past my ankles and these are actually bunching at my ankles, which was crazy to me lol<br />soft material, came quick.<br />would definitely recommend. it seems a lot of people have given bewild bad reviews.  now, maybe that is rightfully so, but my experience is otherwise.  my product took roughly 4 days to arrive.  it was packaged in an airtight bag, and was in mint condition.  because of no length option, the pants were a bit long (maybe 3-4 inches longer than expected) but nothing that isn\\'t easily remedied by wearing the right shoes.  they were also larger at the bottom than expected (the image led me to believe they would not \\'completely\\' cover my shoes, which they did), but again, this is hardly a big deal considering i purchased them pretty much for that reason.    now it seems that baggy pants are harder and harder to come by, being as it is no longer the trend (unless your into chains and bondage straps), and so i would highly recommend purchasing through bewild, before pants like this are either impossible to find, or too expensive to be worth-while.  all i wanted was good quality, baggy blue-jeans, and that is exactly what i got. these fit great when i got them. they are a little thin though. the material seems cheap for the price. however, i did like them. they are very comfortable. the flow of the legs is very pretty, but the waist does stretch out as the day goes on. i kept having to pull them up by the end of the day. after the first wash they did shrink a bit so they are shorter now than they were. i just tried wearing them lower on my hips to accommodate the shorter length. great pant runs a little large. great medium weight and nice comfortable ankle length . nice deep indigo color. like this pant for a change at work the med. was like a large i should of got a small so it would be a med. great outfit. i was a little skeptical about buying it, but glad i did. the material is light but surprisingly not too thin. great for summer. looooveüòä love love love this jumper!!! i\\'m a size 10 and i must admit i was apprehensive about ordering a &#34;one size fits all&#34; romper but it fits great, feels comfy, looks fab!! tons of people ask me where i got it. big hit!! love, love kickee pants! but my little (not so little) guy seems to be too big for most pjs. he is just 3 months and the 6-12 mo coverall i just ordered just fits him now! awesome fits me perfect. i weigh 115 and i\\'m 5\\'31/2, i ordered a small when i\\'m normally a xs. not the color i expected but still cute. excellent fit and very comfortable. always have trouble finding pants long enough but there was no problem with these. the length of these were great! this is a great pair of paints.  they were a great present for my dad.  he loves them and wears them all the time. i just get a size up from what i normally get i love these cloths! these are pretty comfortable! the pockets are a little shallow because of the way they are made, but they look pretty cool. i like that they\\'re on the side instead of in the front or on the back. i only have two complaints: (1) the material doesn\\'t respond well to friction, so unless your thighs don\\'t touch, you\\'re probably going to make the material really rough/worn just from a normal amount of walking. (2) the waistband tends to roll down sometimes, which isn\\'t a big deal. it doesn\\'t really matter, just kind of a bother to fix every now and then. other than that these are pretty comfy lounge pants and they look great. i thought first that i don\\'t want to spend much money on maternity clothes, since i\\'d be only wearing them for a few months. after trying on countless pants at gap and target and being disappointed with the fit and quality, i decided that there is no reason for me to look and feel frumpy during this most exciting time in my life, and decided to splurge on a few key pieces that i would get a lot of use out of.<br /><br />halfway into my 2nd trimester when my normal jeans and pants started to become uncomfortable, i bought 2 pairs of ag pants (these corduroys and a pea in the pod collection: ag jeans ballad secret fit belly(tm) twill stretch fabric boot cut maternity pants) and i couldn\\'t be happier with both! when worn with a long top or tunic, they don\\'t look like maternity pants at all but rather like my normal designer jeans. both are long enough for me (i\\'m a leggy 5\\'10\\\\\\\\\"), fit perfectly around butt and thighs (i normally wear size 28; ordered size 29 thinking that a little extra room might come handy in another few months. there is definitely some room for me to fill out if needed but they are not saggy at all) - and the long stretchy panel for belly is super comfortable. it\\'s still slightly loose (my belly is not that big yet) but i just wear a bellaband over it - and it\\'s great!<br /><br />i\\'ve been practically living in these pants the last few weeks and can confidently say that this was money well spent. highly recommended! this is great pants, the only thing it is very transparent which is unconfortable for me. very comfortable.  love the cut.  good pants! nice pants mom friendly workout pants... yeah!  these yoga pants are very comfortable to work out in.  with enough stretch for any kind of workout yet keep you looking trim at the same time.  i love things you can toss in the washer and dryer, but this is a washer...hang to dry item.  they wrinkle when dried in the dryer.  over-all they are worth the effort. so comfy and exactly as pictured. shipped quickly. she got so many complements she loves to be the only one with such a unique style,and besides who doesn\\'t love ‚ù§ marilyn monroe! soft and comfortable...fit is loose but not too loose. just what i hoped for. i love these legging. i just got them and wore them to a 90 min zumba class and they did great. i am 127lb and 5\\'5&#34; tall and wear a size 6 pants. if your anywhere near me in size these will be great. wish there was some elastic in the waistband, little harder to keep up than i thought but:<br />warm & very nice looking, getting compliments from folks @ the dog park already :) speedy shipping, received much sooner that expected. very nice material, although thin it actually serves it\\'s purpose. excellent<br />four-way stretch, nice inner small key pocket. the stirrups are very handy to help keep that slim-style look and in my opinion do not bind and actually keeps the bottoms from \\'riding\\' up your legs.very pleased, highly recommend them. i also purchased the black<br />with white stripe pants after i decided that these were the best for the price on the market!<br />aloha, keoni i really like this item i recommend it the color the size and fit good thank you for this item pants are made of strong material, nicely made.  they are really holding up to a lot of wear and tear! very comfy.  only problem is they tend to slide down and i\\'m constantly pulling them back up.  possibly from the material stretching out? now i can ware some jeans that never fitted me before.<br /><br />the stretcher is easy to use and store.<br /><br />all of my fat friends will learn about the waistband stretcher. these are great for helping potty train little boys. we never used pull-ups. we potty trained my son in about two weeks switching from cloth diapers to these, cold turkey. i looked into cloth training pants but i decided that i didn\\'t want to go that route. i didn\\'t want something that would keep him comfortable with being wet like diapers [and pull-ups] do. i was hoping these would absorb some of the mess of accidents. they do, but pee still goes right through them. they are really much better for #2 accidents. i really feel like these helped potty train my son so quickly because he felt when he was wet and didn\\'t like it. he learned quickly that he needed to pee in the potty otherwise he would be wet and uncomfortable.<br /><br />i also really liked that these do not have an elastic waistband. they were very very easy for my 2 year old to pull up and down completely on his own. most toddler underwear has an elastic white waistband that my son had trouble with. these worked perfectly. hardtail is the best.  found out that i was buying a medium but this time i ordered small and they fit so much better. great product - fast delivery my granddaughters name is calli and she loved the sweat pants. my favorite hang out pants!  super comfortable.  super stylish.  great material.  everybody compliments them. ellazhu did it again! love them! they are absolutely comfy and great for cold days. they look nice under a short dress or longer tops. they also look great with boots. i recommend strongly to buy it!!  inside of the pants is so soft  ! very easy to wear. you can dress it up with heels and casual with flip flops. i bought it two colors navy and black. great to wear when you\\'re feeling bloated / fat. people stop me and ask me &#34;who\\'s the designer?&#34; all the time! i love it! i adore these pajamas.  note that the red colour is more of a burgundy hue that bright red but i don\\'t mind.  still a good colour. great looking. slimming. no pockets. good length. warm. comfy. might get another pair. can just use for lounging. cute pjs. fabric is nice and thick and soft. these pants had to be shortened for my daughters tap dance performance.  the quality and price where great but since i had to shorten them it ended up being more costly. finally, a pair of yoga pants that are suitable for my baby to wear to our starbucks outings.  thanks yoga sprout!!! amazing comfy and light they stretch easily, are soft cotton, and feel very comfortable.  i am very pleased with them. i bought these for my newborn daughter. they are so soft- i loved putting her in it and was sad when she quickly outgrew them. the pajamas are very fitted (which i liked) so do not expect your baby to be able to wear them for long. in hindsight..i would have probably went with the next size up so that i could get more use out of them! the pants are made of a super soft material. i got an xl and they fit like an xxl. exactly what i was looking for really warm would buy again if i ever needed another one these yoga pants are fine, though the wide top band folds down and stays down when i move, which is not what i thought it would do.  however, they are comfortable and designed for motion, which i need teaching dance, so i\\'m glad i got them. i ordered size 3 it fit perfectly ...i\\'m 5 \\'2 and 123 pound. i love the way it fit me and it shows i have a bigger butt.i have to order more different  color. great pants. fit me just right since i am a 32\\\\\\\\\" waist and got the mediums. quality fabric, exactly as described. great for squats, dead lifts, martial arts or just walking around in. perfect for hitting the gym with some style. comfortable. fit good. i really like knot hats, and kicky pants is a great company, so i didn\\'t hesitate purchasing this item.  i love turquoise, as the image looks on the screen.  i was disappointed when i opened the package and the color was a dingy gray-blue.  also, the fabric is much thinner than anticipated - i thought it would be sock-like thickness, but it\\'s more like stockings. it works well as a cranial insulating accessory, so it\\'s not a huge deal, but ultimately i wasn\\'t impressed by the representation of the product. besides being somewhat large, they\\'re great! i love these leggings and i have only worn them twice. each time i wore them i got a plethora of comments, all good of course. 5 stars to propper for quality, durability and comfort. the best clothing for military and outdoors person. great product for everyday use. great pant!  they were a little long on me and i am 5\\'8&#34; and yes i did roll them up.  over all i love them and can\\'t wait to wear them on walks and to the gym! love love love these pants.  i am 6\\'2 and can never find &#34;tall&#34; work out pants (yoga or otherwise) however these pants fit beautifully and are very long and are not thin at all like some of the other reviews stated.  well worth the price and i would buy again. fits perfect and is very comfy. the quality is thin, but if you take care of it i believe it will last. it is very cute and fun, these pants are perfectly stretchy and soft and feel like a second skin. the small was a perfect length for me; i\\'m 5\\'4\\\\\\\\\". i loveee these pants! these pants kick @&$!!! i just love these pants... i have ordered these twice now and will be ordering more.  great item at a great price!!!!  great customer service also, what more could you ask for??? i am pleased with the velrose plus size snip-it crochet edge petti... the package came on time. the seller described the item perfectly. and the item fits to a t. i was not sent the brand listed here, but the pants do look the same. they run pretty small. i would recommend buying a size bigger, especially if you plan on drying them. they are pretty thick material. seem to be fairly good material. my daughter uses them for cosmetology school. they are form fitting/stretch. the knees do not pucker out after wearing them for a few hours, so that is a huge plus. overall we are satisfied with the purchase, even though we were sent a different brand. the price was good and they are definitely worth what i paid, so i have no complaints. this product saved several pairs of from the goodwill bin, use it all the time.who needs diets . very easy to use. i really loved these pants!!! just trying them on i could tell they work. i did have to return for a larger size.  other reviews stated they run a little large but i did not experience that. if you follow their measurement chart you will get the size you need. overall the product was worth the return and re-ordering process! i really like these yoga pants because they are extra long, as a taller woman i dread the highwaters of my youth! they are actully a bit too long for me and that is fine - these are for exercise, not walking in the woods - although i do take my dog for a walk in them most days. i just got a second order (because i like these so much - got them in several colors and actually 2 different sizes since i am trying to lose weight) and although the pair i wore today has the correct size on it - they are tighter and shorter than the others, not a problem, still within range for me but this may indicate that different colors are sized differently? or there is variation in the sizes? not sure.<br /><br />when i ordered the first time 3 of the items were correct, one was the wrong size and color but i contacted the seller and they answered right away and they sent out a new pair along with a return shipping label. i was very pleased with the service and have ordered again. i still have one pair to try on and trust that they are (hopefully) the same as the first items i bought in size, if not that they are within my range.<br /><br />all in all the pants are comfortable and sized appropriately, and the customer service was excellent.<br /><br />yoga pants that stay in place<br />normally don\\'t purchase yoga pants unless they have a drawstring, but made an exception in this case and glad i did. fabric is hearty and snug, so no problem with sliding or pulling down during practice. fit right and stayed put so will be buying another pair.<br /><br />love<br />these are my feel good pants, they look and feel good. i ordered more, but it came in wrong color. sending back and reordering no cost to me. i love amazon! this is a quality product at a great price! i purchased these pants for my daughter\\'s dance recital and couldn\\'t be happier. i wanted comfortable &#34;home pants&#34;  and these almost fit the bill.  one size fits all, though, is ridiculous.  these pants are comfortable but i\\'d like one size larger since they are my comfy home pants and i am 5\\'4&#34; 128 lbs.  all in all, i like them, just wish i could get a slightly bigger size, especially considering what happens after washing.  if you\\'re quite small,  they\\'re great and the pockets are a great extra.. i love the style of these jeans, but they are sized big.  i\\'m going to orders another colour but smaller size. love it i have one pair of victoria secret yoga pants which i completely wore out.  they did not last as long as they should have for the price i paid for em.  these are really holding up though. they make my butt look fabulous as well. (; these were great but not long enough for me.  i am 5\\'8&#34; tall and needed maybe an inch more in length to please me.  too bad. i bought this for a birthday gift and the fit was perfect and wears very nice! i\\'m just sorry i didn\\'t buy myself a pair!!!! pants as previously reviewed run a little small, ordered one size larger.. perfect fit i have been looking for a pair of convertible pants for a while. i found these and poured over the reviews and decided to take chance. i am very happy that i did. these pants are well constructed out of quick drying rip-stop type fabric. they have many features not discussed in the product\\'s description - separate zippered pocket within a pocket (for safe storage of a wallet?), zippers at the ankles to ease slipping over boots, zippered rear pockets and two nice cargo pockets on the side (with a larger than normal velcro closure.)     these pants are great for outdoor activities like hiking, canoeing, kayaking, etc.     i am pleased with these pants and would recommend them highly! there perfect. there flexible and comfortable to dance in. she was happy i\\'m not necessarily the smallest woman around, these fit, barely. the only thing with these is its a one size fits all deal even when it says medium here, when u get it mine said one size fits all, so, they run small. i\\'m 5\\'6&#34;, 140lbs, 36c 28&#34;waist. i do have my fiancee help me stretch the legs length and width, same with the top half, lol, works good. match with heels, instant sexy, wear with flip flops, instant daily romper. it\\'s versatile. quality is not the best, wash by hand or on gentle, do not dry in a dryer!!! it will shrink! i love them can\\'t buy enough,think i\\'ve got 4 of them, working on more. great on time i can\\'t say enough about how pleased we\\'ve been with all of the products we\\'ve purchased for our niece from luvable friends. she\\'s 5 1/2 months, almost 14lbs. she started out preemie but has recently started on rice and baby food so she\\'s getting cute little pudgy \\\\\\\\\"sausage\\\\\\\\\" legs. these pants are great. they don\\'t bunch up when she kicks like some of the others she has for smaller babies and they don\\'t fall off around the waist. they\\'ve out lasted other brands in terms of size and durability. they\\'re great to mix & match with all the \\\\\\\\\"onesies\\\\\\\\\" and her little sweaters and they\\'re warmer than most we\\'ve found locally. i love thesse pants because they are so comfterbul and you would like you get more after you get one pair the material is a little on the thin side, but what you expect for the cost‚Ä¶ other than that i have no complaints. i love these shoes. we were in potty training h*ll for a while, not really able to leave the house unless we put a pull-up on, but my son quickly learned that he could go to the bathroom in his pull-up, so we were just going around in circles.  we were using the gerber lined underwear around the house, which were great because they would minimize the mess, but he would still know that he was wet, which he didn\\'t like.  i wanted something similar for going out, but needed it to completely contain the mess without having to put on those awful rubber pants.  the potty scottys fit the bill perfectly!  he would have accidents while out, but would immediately know he was wet, and it was a simple undie change with no mess (unless he pooped, but that\\'s a different story).<br /><br />i bought a three-pack, but would recommend a bigger pack if you don\\'t want to do laundry every single night.  i literally washed all three of these every single night for quite some time; they held up very well!<br /><br />my only complaint is that the thighs were a bit snug (and my son is rather lean), so the average sized kid would probably have little band marks on his thighs.  i got the medium size, and they fit great everywhere, except the snug thighs (my son was 31 pounds at the time).  also, later on, during night potty training, i tried these as an alternative to pull-ups, and because they do not wick moisture away from the skin (they are not meant to, so this was my own fault), he got an awful rash from being wet all night  :(  but, he didn\\'t leak a single drop!  i was very impressed!!!<br /><br />overall, they are wonderful.  the kid will know when they are wet, and that will take you leaps and bounds in potty training.  best of luck in your end-of-diaper adventures! very comfortable. comfy!! good they look super awesome and fit well. i am a pretty thick 34 waist and the medium is very comfortable. it does say to wash cool with like colors only so that might be a pain but i\\'ll update if i have any problems with washing them. overall im extremely satisfied. great way to show your ac love. there great for the past few weeks, i\\'ve been wearing this slimhot capris and the everlast 2-in-1 neoprene short for my twice daily walks. since these are my favorite two sweat pants, this review will be focusing on the difference and the strength of each, to me anyways.<br /><br />first of all, the fit for this capric is spot on for me. i usually wear size 6-10 long women\\'s pants depends on the cut and materials. i have smaller waist and a full bottom plus longer legs thus the wide size range. the size s-m slimhot capris fits me perfectly. the capris comes to an inch below my knees and the legs do not ride when i move. the waist of size sm fits my 27 waist fine, a bit loose sometimes. the widest of my bottom at 36 also fits.<br /><br />what i like most about the slimhot are the materials, design, and workmanship. the material of the slimhot capris is much thinner than other neoprene shorts i\\'ve worn including the everlast. that gives it more flexibility. with other thicker neoprene short, my movement are limited to walks. the slimhot capris allows me to do some simple yoga movements with ease and still be able to breath. being thin does not mean sacrificing durability. the slimhot capris feels better constructed, smoother, and more durable.  being thinner also enables me to pull up the capris without struggling with a zipper. since these neoprene shorts have a lot of contact with skin, the void of a zipper means much more comfortable dressing and workout. i also like how the capris comes below my knees to keep my knees warm in cooler morning walks.<br /><br />the difference of the material between slimhot and other thicker neoprene shows not only in flexibility, the lack of zipper. i do notice i sweat less when wearing slimhot than everlast neoprene short while doing almost exact routines. so often times i would put on some albolene with wraps to raise skin temperature. everlast all-in-1 has the built-in high waist which keeps my back warmer. but i think a much higher waist could be challenging without a zipper.  so for my needs the design of slimhot based on its material is perfect. since my goal is more for toning, i find myself reaching for the slimhot more mainly because of its soft material, its better workmanship, its flexibility, its design of no zipper. for someone who wishes to sweat more, probably look at thicker materials or a delfin. top notch quality, perfect fit.  love the distressed logo.  the draw string is the best i\\'ve ever had on a pair of pants like this. the material is extra good, and there is light padding on the knees.<br />only one thing i\\'d change, adding pockets.  the fit is perfect without them, and would probably look worse, but it would be more convienent.<br />they exceeded my expectations. great looking and fitting pants.  i love these pants as described comfy it was a journey to have these pants and all because i was relocating when i made this order. they were very supportive with me but thanks to them , i got my pants and i must say they are f a n t a s t i c!! the fit is more than perfect, the material is soft and good quality, the length is just perfect too. i am 5\\'7&#34; and about 140 pounds. if you are like me , you may want to get  the medium. that is what i got.,<br /><br />i would like to say thank you to the customer service gayane brown. thank you for your patience and efficiency.you were just perfect!<br /><br />no doubts i will order other pants with them.<br /><br />congratulations for you services and clothes. these pants are amazbeans . the only problem is that the tiger is bigger than shown and is an iron on,, other than that its perfect and looks cute so totally worth it üëç the pants look like yoga pants. very casual and comfortable due to the not too tight tummy control. if there are back pockets i would give 4.5 stars. bought these as a christmas present for the wife and she loves them.  they are not too warm and are lose enough for easy movement. super comfy & cute these pants fit perfectly to size.  i ordered medium and i am 5\\' 8&#34; tall.  i am going to place another order for more colors. just great!!! love these for summer these pants are so adorable. i was sold the minute i saw that yoga baby pants existed. the material is soft & stretchy, the colors are depicted accurately, & the look like they\\'ll fit very comfortably. got these way early, 4 days after i ordered! fits as expected, really long in the legs so have to roll them up (im 5 ft7) the color is lighter lime green than the picture though but only a little. super sexy pants definitely recommend them but shorter people may have to hem the bottoms. thanks a lot tripp ill buy from you till i die.<br /><br />friendly note: ive been buying tripp clothing for over 5 years now, the quality isnt &#34;super&#34; amazing so do not put these in he dryer. the color will fade really bad quickly if you do. turn inside out, wash in cold and hang up to dry outside or in bathroom with fan on to keep color radiant for longer. i went back and got me 2 more, they even come in a corduroy. i will wait till winter comes around for those tho! very good martierial,beautiful disign but runs very small the material feels wonderful, natural and they do not sag at the end of the day!<br />i have stretched and played in these. i also like the thickness of the material. i needed a new pair of pants for work and i bought these and was not disappointed. great fit i love them! fits good, relaxed fit, not too tight around waist. it is pretty thin so not very warm. great for casual wear. these pants are well made, are very soft and safe for baby\\'s skin.  i like that they are made with organic cotton  they are comfortable and not too tight over baby little round belly and leave enough room for diapers. i love these. i have gotten two pairs now more like magenta than purple and draw string was too short but contacted seller and fixed situation legs are to long super warm what a phenomenal pair of pants. these little guys can take you anywhere and fit like a dream. if you don\\'t buy these, you aren\\'t a dreamer. my son loves them! very good these jeans are very comfortable thanks to the slight stretch (2% spandex). true to size. i bought the black ones for my trip to europe and they were perfect. i\\'ve received lots of compliments on them as well. i only wish they weren\\'t sold out of the grey color. my wife is a notre dame fan loves these.  we have a running feud with the michigan fans next door. loveeeeee it !!!!!!!!!! the pants are pretty nice and exactly what i pictured when i purchased them.  my only gripe is that i wish the pants were a little longer.  i\\'m 5\\'7. he loves the grinch hi, the pants are good in quality, they have a washout look, colors are not 100% vivid, they are like those pants that you have washed for several times and that the colors start to whiten.<br />the reason i gave 4 stars its because sizing is very bad. i normally wear jeans with size 34 (i dont know if this is inches or what, its the size that you find in any jeans on the waist, 34) and they didnt fit me, very tight.<br />so please consider this so u have no surprises. these fit like a glove and i knew they would ,<br /> they were long nlough for me also and that is saying a lot. my niece loves them. very cute on her, but i did purchase them for myself. don\\'t be cheaper with the fabric,-- some of us enjoy the whole burger! ;) nicely made, soft cotton flannel pajama pants. price is right and design is sure to thrill any closet nerd in your life. my mom loves this outfit prefect finding good work pants that look and feel great has been hard! these are awesome!! great staple to have in the closet and they fit just right.  other panels, over the tummy part, are really thick and cause me to sweat thanks to me being a battery at the moment, but these are nice and light weight.  i am going to be in my third trimester when it is 100 + so i am thankful to have these! a little thicker than i expected, but very cozy and comfortable to wear<br />lounging or sleeping.  i ordered a size up and was glad i did. got these for my fiance for her birthday, and she absolutely loves them! they\\'re extremely soft and cozy for her. the print looks very good as well. i am very happy with this purchase. nice and warm very good like what i imagine it fit as expected and long enough i\\'m 5\\'10&#34; liz clairborne 4p with this pants is true to size.  great fit!<br /><br />great quality that will last for many years... these pants are cute enough to wear out and comfortable enough to lounge around in.  what could be better? item didn\\'t work for me, didn\\'t come to waist and didn\\'t go to ankles.  i\\'m 5\\'5\\\\\\\\\" and hippy and things differ for me from one item to another.  i appreciate the excellent customer service provided by the seller.  there was nothing wrong with the item, it just didn\\'t fit my build.  i would give it a 5 stars, but i want others to look at the comments in case they\\'re hippy. i\\'ve had these for a little bit but they seem to be fading already :(<br />otherwise they are pretty darn comfy love it i love these u turn butt lifting jeans. i have three pairs and i will be buying more in different colors. they are comfortable and very flattering. i got many compliments when i was wearing them. my husband loves it and i do to i love this product! it is soft, stretchy, and fits perfectly. i would recommend this to anyone. the color also looks as it does in the photo. i love these joggers üòçüòç i love these yoga pants! i\\'ve purchased three pairs of them now. i used them post-surgery when jeans were too rough against the healing incisions in my knees. they\\'re very nice looking and don\\'t lose their shape. i even wear them to professional events, now that i\\'m preggers and my slacks don\\'t fit anymore. super happy with this purchase. i have used these a number of times without failure. my youngest wore a pair on a 10 mile hike down a volcano in panama with no issues.<br /><br />i would not wear these while bird hunting in thorns, or bashing through thick brush.<br /><br />however, if you need something that is light, easy to pack, priced right, and works in reasonable conditions these can not be beat. these are super cute, comfortable and sexy! they look great with boots or heels. and make your butt look amazing! really cute ;) these are soft and not too baggy for pajama pants. gave them to my husband for a christmas gift and the smile on his face was perfect:) love this brand.. just can\\'t find them.. good fit.. don\\'t show my butt or undies... comfy i love this outfit  it fits perfectly work great these pants are really comfortable for yoga and just wearing around the house.  at first they looked a little big, but they shrunk a little in the wash and now fit just about perfectly.  i like that they aren\\'t too thin or too tight.  the only problems are really minor- one of the leg hems isn\\'t completely straight and the waist is a tad loose.  overall, i\\'m very happy with these pants, and i would definitely order another pair! these definitely make you sweat. i am a size 11 in jeans and the medium fits perfectly. they have a very high waist, and they are loud when you walk, but they do the job. i will leave another review in a couple of weeks if i\\'ve lost any inches or weight. cute fit my 7 month old well. for the money - chinese made - can\\'t be beaten.  only problem after a couple of washes in the machine was a draw string raveling.  no biggie but will need replacement with coat hanger or other threading device.  can\\'t compare with others since i haven\\'t purchased scrubs; only \\\\\\\\\"borrowed\\\\\\\\\" them over the years. fit very nice. just a bit too long. but, a great lounge around do anything pants. they work well as pajamas too. great lounge pants or running pants very comfortable and durable look forward to buying anotheer pair soon perfect fit. lol i\\'m a total star wars and yoda fan so i absolutely love this design much more then the other star wars legging i saw. i would give 5 stars if they were thicker material so i would feel comfortable wearing them more often, they\\'re so thin i\\'m afraid that they will run but not thin enough to be see through. i\\'m 5\\'4, size 8-10 and carry most of my weight in my rear and thighs, waist 34&#34;. they fit well with  little bunch at the ankle. love them, just wish they were thicker. fit perfectly. the only down side is the ribbon on the the top. it will keep untying the more you move around unless you knot it. i may replace the ribbon with something that will hold until i\\'m ready to have it untied. like terry cloth, or cotton. i love these pants.  think of them as summer sweatpants, but cute.  very lite and comfy.  they are my favorite thing to change into when i get home from work.  they are not high enough to be a jumper unless you are very short wasted.  they come just under my chest and i am 5\\'2&#34;.  so the extra wide band doesn\\'t seem necessary and i generally fold mine over.  still i love them.  i got the red, the blue/purple, and the multi.  the red is a little stiff, but the purple and the multi are great.  i\\'m waiting for the green to come back so i can get it too. love it! best leggings i ever bought! awesome feel and stretch. i don\\'t like wearing full length jeans in hot weather so using this tape to convert them into capri\\'s is just what i need. i see that brisol 6 rep\\'s. read these reviews and just want to mention that i learned of your product in usa weekend. i am always very skeptical when buying clothes online.<br />usually things do not fit the way they should or a seam is off a bit.<br /><br />these pants are perfect!<br />i can walk around without feeling like my underwear are showing like i do in other maternity pants with the secret belly fit.<br />i bought them in black and they look so sleek but not too fancy that you wouldn\\'t just wear them out to the store.<br />i will be buying these in blue and green as well!<br />so pleased to finally find the perfect fit!<br /><br />thank you so much! these are the most comfortable pants that i have ever put on! they are like wearing nothing! perfect for vacation in warm climates when you don\\'t want to wear shorts. can be dressed up or down. i will be buying several more pairs. they were a bit too long for me, but that was to be expected because i\\'m short (5\\'3&#34;). love them!! decent for the price very pleased with items and delivery. only improvement would be pockets it was nicer than expected. fits as expected....i\\'m 5\\'8&#34; and they are just right on me. perfect for the beach.  no pockets though....materiel is light, color as shown super soft and very stretchy which makes them easy to put on and take off.  i love the colors and design.  although they are super comfy and wonderful, they are not the most durable.  the design as worn off on the butt and between the legs the seam has pulled apart.  i have another pair of footed pjs from kikee pants and they somehow got a hole in them too.  the fabric seems a bit prone to that. i love these pants so much, i bought a pair in every color for my son. they\\'re so soft, breathable, durable, and lightweight. he can sleep or play in them without chafing or overheating, even when swaddled. they\\'re cute, too. but what i really love about them is that i\\'ve thrown them in the wash and i\\'ve never had a single fray or loose thread. love it! buckles wonderfully, has a great photo! feels well made and fits into all my jeans, with a little persuasion haha love these! fit great! all my friends loved them. i ordered the m/l and im a size 9/10 and they fit perfect. i bought these pants for my mom.  she is very picky, but she loves these.  they fit her well and are very comfortable. talk about a perfect fit. these pants are wonderful. they wear beautifully and feel so soft against the skin. very stylish! very comfy! i am ordering another pair. i have the tank top & nightgown too and want more! <br /> i purchased a pair of these pants recently and had the unfortunate luck to put them to the test. i was riding along @60mph on the interstate when suddenly everyone was braking. i hit my brakes, the rear wheel locked up, fishtailed, and threw me to the ground. skidding along the pavement at 60mph, i can tell you that the knee and hip armor absorbed the impact and the rest of the pants stayed together very well, much better than what denim pants would have done. i think the waterproof aspect of these pants may have now been compromised, but that is just the excuse i will use to go ahead and order another pair.<br />what could have been a terrible accident with a destroyed knee and hips and thighs turned to roadrash hamburger, instead left me with only a slight scraped area on my forearm and a banged up shoulder, but hips and knees and all the walking bits are fine. i know there are more expensive pants out there and maybe they are even more amazing, but these pants saved my precious skin and i am going to buy a replacement pair. they fit perfectly!!! i love them so much! :d<br />i\\'m so glad they came. they\\'re perfection at its finest. couldn\\'t ask for better! :) these leggings are so soft & comfortable! i\\'m 5\\'2&#34;, 110 lbs & these fit perfect. if you are any bigger they might be too snug since it\\'s one size great so cute thank you fits perfect price awesome very nice. long enough .am 5\\'8 i bought these sweats for me!  i love the way they fit, very loose and the bottoms are like a bootcut.  they have deep pockets and are just plain comfortable....i wear them all day some days.  i have two pair. i\\'m 4\\'11&#34; and around 105 lbs - the small fit well (maybe even a little too big). those fleece lined leggings are the warmest i have ever had and extremely comfortable. if you don\\'t want to freeze in winter they are the best choice. the linen is high quality linen with good body and feels light on the body they fit as expected until i washed them. they shrink horribly in the dryer. if you wash them air dry them. other then that i love these jeans i give 4 stars because i ordered a size 11 thinking i would size up a little but i received a large. kinda weird. why order a number when i got a letter. what\\'s the point? these pants do fit but they\\'re tight as heck in the waist. i plan on losing weight so this could be a good thing. for example, my pants from new york and co are a size 10 and i\\'m 5\\'8, these skinny pants are nice and long i could wear a tall boot or a pump with them. aside from the sizing weirdness,  these are super comfortable and yes my small, flat butt looks amazing in them. they are of great quality. i do recommend these but go a size larger than you think. i really love them - so comfy! and would be more - but i cannot wear them into public without a long shirt as they are see through. nice durable pants.  sizing runs small though be cautious when ordering to the size you think you need, error on the cautious side and go one size larger. comfortable and useful for hanging around the house.  pleased with the product.  price is good if you find on sale.  the odd aspect of this purchase is i found the exact same product for half the price via an intermediate web site that processed the sale through the same company that advertised the pant at full price on the suppliers company web site. this legging is awesome. the design is very sexy and i love it. the waistband is very stretchy and the material is very soft and smooth. it fits me perfectly. i feel comfortable after wearing it. there are all sorts of different designs lumped together, but the bright flowered ones are great.  5\\'9&#34; - 140# and they fit wonderfully. these are probably an xs or s in women\\'s. i really like them. they are very comfortable, and fit as expected. great pair of jeans for a cheap price. as other reviews say, these pants are made for a tall, thin child. my daughter is 5\\' and 80 pounds and has about a 24&#34; inseam. she wears size 10 jeans. the large fit her perfectly. the pant legs fell right on top of her feet in jazz shoes (no heels). waist is about inch too large.<br />length is a guess on some pants now a days.... they just ask waist, whats up with that.<br />the pants expensive. i asked about return them for another size. though they were very kind in response etc. was going to cost me another 30 bucks for return. well they are in germany im in usa.<br />for that i can have them altered or throw in hot water and dryer, see what happens.<br />all in all i think best feeling camos out there.<br />c/ya waist and legs fit great but the pants are super long. i was looking for maternity yoga pants when i found these, and i love them! i am normally a size 6 in pants, but am 7 months pregnant, and the large fits great. i think they will fit after baby too though, as they are not baggy anywhere on my legs or anything, so they may run a bit small. they are also long, which is great for me (im 5\\'8). i have a hard time finding yoga pants that don\\'t shrink up in length after a wash, but these still fit wonderfully :) the transaction was ideal and the item is great. nice material, great fit - a definitely good purchase.  they do run a little long, but other than that i love \\'em these are very comfortable and they have a very flattering fit~<br />i have noticed that the red has already faded after only a few washes i am 5\\'7 / 165 lbs and bought the large. they fit perfectly. they are sheer but non see thru. the pants fit me just great, i am only 5\\'2 142 lbs, and the medium worked on me, and the slimming effect is great. i will buy more in different colors!! hard tail are the best pants you can get wash and wear and always comport when wearing them...need more now! i just got these put them on for dance the same night. my teacher and fellow students now want them. i highly recommend these pants.  i can\\'t wait to buy more. i am so glad that i saw this outfit on amazon. the fit is comfortable and the fabric is cool and comfortable. i\\'m 5\\'2\\\\\\\\\" and wear size 14. the blue is actually navy.  this is exactly what i wanted since black, although sophisticated and fashionable, it\\'s difficult for me to wear. i\\'ll wear a jacket so \\\\\\\\\"smushing\\\\\\\\\" won\\'t be a consideration. great purchase in every way! these came in for me, today. i was a little nervous at first about them, because i\\'m tall(5\\'7\\\\\\\\\") and slender(136lbs), and i ordered a size medium.. but they fit perfectly! the material is nice, and they don\\'t look cheap or tacky. they are a really nice comfortable pair of yoga pants that you can wear out, around the house, or to work out in. i love them and i\\'m very happy with the price & the product. :) no damages from what i can see either. snug fit. very comfortable. fits male anatomy correctly. pouch is very pronounced. provides some support in most cases. reasonably durable but the material is pretty thin and will snag if caught on anything. if you have the older version and are looking for replacements there is a slight difference in the waistband between the old and new version but not that significant. price is right, color is very pretty. i am a girl that prefers comfort first and this piece is both comfortable and unexpected. one of those things you won\\'t expect anyone to have on but everybody is asking where did you get it from. added a statement necklace and a pair of &#34;bling&#34; flat sandals from bcbg and i danced all nightüíÉ and loved it! i love these pants, they are so comfortable. you can adjust them somewhat since they have a wide waistband.  i have gotten many compliments wearing these .  can\\'t beat the price either. i have ordered them in several colors. these are a birthday gift for my husband (december).  so they\\'re wrapped up along with the soft kitty t-shirt.  they look nice & to be of good quality. can be dressed up or down. i plan to purchase more in other colors. can\\'t wait to wear these out! ordered what i thought would fit and had to send them back. i left a note online and had to pay for shipping the return. promptly at their cost a new pair arrives which fit great.  i had to go bigger on the waist and the length was a little long nice jeans ,next time i\\'ll order smaller size great, padding caught a little accident and didn\\'t get pants wet.  just why i wanted training pants. great yoga pants, great colors. not as heavy weight as i expected, but its nice that they are made in the us. the only problem is that they put their stupid logo on the back of the pants. i don\\'t like it, and my boyfriend especially doesn\\'t like it. he hates their being a logo above my rear...people are already looking at it in yoga pants, and i\\'m sure that\\'s why they put it there, but i hate it. if i like the yoga pants, i will leave a nice review and tell all of my friends where to get them... you don\\'t have to put an advertisement on my butt. very nice and comfortable bought these for my wife, she normally wears a size 7 jean and these fit her perfect so i\\'d assume they\\'re true to size.  great product,  wife loved them.  happy wife = happy life my son never takes them off! these yoga pants are more comfortable than i had expected. great for lounging around the house. legs are a bit wider than i had anticipated but overall great pants. bought these for my tween daughter, to be worn over underwear,for modesty when wearing skirts, and they are just perfect. perfect yoga capris! crazee wear pants are my work pants of choice, being a acsm certified personal trainer since 1991.<br />easy to wash, deep pockets and very durable. some of my pairs are over a decade old! looks well made enough. luckily, i read the reviews and knew i needed to order up. i normally wear a 9, and i ordered an 11 and they are still snug. kinda like the jeans from wet seal. so keep that in mind. if you like loose, consider ordering 2 sizes up. i received these sydney \\\\\\\\\"ideal fit\\\\\\\\\" dockers in khaki as a christmas present and they are true to size. nothing usually fits me true to my measurements and the size listed, but these fit great! i have a relatively average to short waist and long legs. the 34\\\\\\\\\" inseam on these pants makes the long great for long legs. the \\\\\\\\\"slightly below waistline\\\\\\\\\" fit is just as described. they\\'re not \\\\\\\\\"mom jeans,\\\\\\\\\" but i\\'m not at risk of showing off my underwear in them either -- perfect waist height for a 30ish mom who still wants to be hip. and, they don\\'t wrinkle -- also great for a busy lifestyle. i love them, and highly recommend the sydney ideal fit dockers. great product,  just ran a bit on the small side. you might want to step up a size but other than that they are great. was glad to find them a little big. great i bought them to use as work pants. they were cute but unfortunately didn\\'t fit so i had to send them back. i\\'m a size 13 n the large was too tight. i could get them on and button them but wouldn\\'t want to wear them for hours at work. love these! inexpensive, comfy and cute! got these for the wife, and she loves them. they fit great, and she actually ordered more in different colors. a+++ first pair of pants i\\'ve gotten that fit me perfectly!! i\\'m so excited and ready to oder more!<br />worried about how thin they are, but i\\'m still really happy about my choice to get these. i ordered these as a three pack also, and got one, would have not ordered had i known that, fit is fine, fabric is thinner than i like but was expecting three pairs. this is an adorable outfit & the colors are so bright. i would definitely say it\\'s a spring outfit with the color & 3/4 sleeves. i had some issues of chafing during the summer time when wearing skirts, these are an amazing solution to that problem. love this pant. it dries quickly when wet and seem mess proof. so mommy approve, and my little one say it\\'s comfy. excellent product. i bought them as gift for my boyfriend who loves attack on titan. he usually wears either a medium or a small, i however could only buy a large and they fit perfectly! though if you strictly wear mediums i would buy an xl. they are very soft and the ties are nice. symbol is a bit smaller than pictured, but still clear and looks nice. there was a small hole in one of the pockets, but nothing a bit of sewing can\\'t fix. also has a back pocket that he loves. highly recommend. they do run a bit big but not bad!!  really soft and comfortable i love them and i am going to buy another pair!! i would say these run true to size. my husband is 5\\'10&#34; and about 180lbs with a size 34 waist. we ordered the medium and they were perfect even after washing and drying. very soft and comfortable. i bought these because the regular underwear obviously do not hold any pee at all. the padding in the training pants is nice..it absorbs most of the pee, but some still obviously leaks out. these fit great, i was afraid they would be too baggy. i would recommend them- it\\'s going to be a messy adventure either way you go at it! these fit amazingly well for me. i usually wear a size 16 or 14 and i thought these would be too snug, but the large hugs my nicely with extra room to spare. on top of that it\\'s super long, which i love since i\\'m a solid 5\\'8&#34; and curvy around the edges. the shipping was great and i\\'ll totally be buying mor in the near future. cut smaller in hips than the rest of the pants.  overall a great product and purchase.  well worth the money fit nicely. sizes ran small the material is durable and deals well with dirt and moisture. i use is as just a shell over long johns or thermal tights.<br />if you have larger thighs get a size up because the pants are tight in the thighs for me but fit my waist. even so the mobility was great and the pants are comfortable to wear all day. absolutely perfect. i love these pants! they are super soft and comfortable and i am planning to buy a few more colors. they fit a little tighter than i thought...but that\\'s probably more my fault than the pants :) anyway they are great for lounging without looking like a total slob! fits well washed up great i gave these as a gift and heard that the baby is wearing them all the time.  they\\'re so cute and comfy.  what more can you ask of baby clothes? very comfortable, but, it\\'s too large.<br />i have very fat legs (af jeans size 4 or 6), so i ordered x-large.  i felt medium is enough....... i love it. i want to get more like it i did not think these where going to fit as well as they did. i am 5\\'9 and 145 pounds, i thought they would not be high waisted enough because nothing ever is because of my height. however this pair was! they are not as shiny as pictured but that is better! great pants great pants. i purchased these pants as part of my then unborn baby\\'s going-home outfit. i had been looking for something that would fit a range of potential baby weights, body types and either a boy or a girl!! these pants, along with other clothing from the zutano \\\\\\\\\"celery dot\\\\\\\\\" line, fit the bill!! it was the perfect going home outfit - soft, easy to put on,and most of all - adorable! unfortunately, my son is now 20 days old and has just about grown out of his \\\\\\\\\"going home\\\\\\\\\" outfit, but i will surely be purchasing more zutano clothing for him in the future. the fabric and fit of these pants are great! i am 5\\'6\\', 170 pounds and wish i would have ordered a larger size due to slight visibility in the rear when bending over (they look and fit great except when the fabric is stressed). i won\\'t be wearing them to yoga or crossfit due to the lessened coverage on my back side, but will be perfect around the house! going to order a size up and hope they are exactly what i\\'m looking for. love it and deadpool the recipient of this gift was delighted to have a pair of sweatpants that weren\\'t made for a much taller woman.  they fit her (5\\'2&#34;) without dragging on the floor.  pretty good. perfect fit!  and lovely material.  they wash beautifully too. good my granddaughter loved this pj set!  it is so pretty and was the perfect surprise for her on our trip to disney world! i\\'m 5\\'3 and 110 pounds i usually buy size 0 or 1. i didn\\'t know if these pants we are right for me because they have no pockets and my butt is little lol. i ordered xs color blue and they looked  great my butt looks perky yeyyy!!!, the material is soft and the pants stayed tied all day which is awesome!. i couldn\\'t wait to order more so i ordered a black pair on thursday morning and i got them on friday afternoon super fast shipping!!!. when you buy pants that are $50 you expected to be amazing and these are just that amazing! 6\\' tall, 160 lbs and medium size fits (top and bottom).  need to supply your own &#34;six-pack&#34; my son wore it to school while they were studying asian china, he likes it a lot. great deal for price. good these are a cute pair of pants i just thought it would be a pair thick like jogging pants but they are very nice anyways ok these pants are not only cute, but very good quality. the stretchy cotton is so soft! definitely ordering more for fall and winter. im impressed since it came directly from china. so worth it !!!! i bought it so that my son could play out in wet playgrounds or simply walk around outside on rainy days.<br /><br />the quality of the suit is very good. my 3-year old son has already used a few times and it has kept him dry and clean! i love these pants. they are very very comfortable. print is so pretty. the sizing chart was correct. i usually wear mediums but i bought a large and they fit as expected it\\'s really beautiful but too large i love the choice of up or down, great style. i love the fit needed a bigger size but didn\\'t have it so we are waiting hoping to get larger ones still keet them these are really well made.  they fit remarkably well and i love the high waist band.  i have a short waist and have had leggings where the waist band cuts you off and makes you look more out of shape than you are.  wearing form fitting shirts would be uncomfortable and unflattering.  the waist band on these doesn\\'t have elastic in it so they are smooth when you put them on.  i highly recommend these!  the snake print is subtle and very eye catching.  i love these leggings! i\\'m about 5\\'8&#34;, and although not generally considered a &#34;tall&#34; size, i definitely have an inordinate problem finding leggings and tights i can fit into.<br /><br />thankfully, these pant-leggings are both long in the legs, and long enough in the torso that i don\\'t have trouble with the crotch ending somewhere near my knees. (i mean, really... i have no problem finding pants, so what\\'s the deal with leggings?)<br /><br />i\\'m also one of those women who like to wear pants with dresses, so these are a great substitution. thicker than \\'regular\\' leggings, and less bulky than slacks, i\\'m happy to have finally found something comfortable and well made. i bought one of each color, but i may have to stock up! they fit just as expected will buy again perfect very comfortable! somehwat thing but what  i expected! also very long i love them nice fitting.  slim leg. love them. i bought more. enough said. i love these pants. comfortable, silky - will be perfect even on a hot summer day, very good quality, excellent price. great for yoga, too ;) will buy more for my sister and a friend. thank you! i\\'m a 34/34 pant and normal build and the medium size was big enough.  the pants were a tad short but large would have been too baggy.  great quality and very comfortable. it\\'s always risky to order pants online. you don\\'t know if they\\'ll fit right. i took a chance on these because i liked the cut and the print. i opened the package, tried them on and they are perfect! i normally wear a 10 and the large was just right. these are my new favorite pants. stats: 5\\'3&#34;, 135lbs these pants are lightweight, but not see-thru, comfortable at the waist (stretchy in the back) and flattering. if you are taller than me, order the long. i have the regular & the length is just perfect for flats. great yoga pants! i ordered another pair fit good and fell good originally purchased a white once that was on sale from other seller, what  mistake, they stained so i threw them out, this one on the other hand are dark colors so my son use only them like the pants. thought they that may run small and ordered larger size; but they are true to size. easy to alter. very comfortable i bought these to wear for bed but they look so good i have worn them as lounge pants and worn them shopping. they are literally the most comfortable pants i own. don\\'t slide down like some of my others. i have worn the top unfolded as it works pretty great as a slight tummy control and gives a smooth line under a fitted shirt. my husband could not stop complimenting me on how good these look on me. wish they came in lots more colors. i have been wearing nike golf pants for the last five years.  i was disappointed with the past year\\'s models as they ran a size smaller, and the material was thinned.  the 2013 dri-fits have brought back nike\\'s normal sizing and improved the cut.  the classic rise was high-waisted and felt like your mother\\'s pants (i gave those to my mother and she loves them btw).  the modern fit waist sits just below my belly button.  the high thigh and crotch areas have slimmed, and the seat area is also tighter.  leaner appearance with a straighter cut leg.  the material is thinner than a few years ago, but that\\'s the case for most companies these days.  better suited for spring and fall seasons rather than cold weather.  stylish and modern silhouette(they are still golf pants), i\\'m very satisfied with my purchase. i love these tights! just got them and have been wearing them everyday. they are comfortable and feel soft to the tough. they are not thick enough to keep you warm so im not sure about the winter thinsulate. i acccidentally put two in my shopping backand thought i bought only one. im glad i got two.love them! ever since i was a young child and first saw god appear on television in the form of mc hammer, i knew my ultimate destiny: to become the world\\'s best mc hammer impersonator.<br /><br />nothing would stop me from achieving this goal - not my creamy white skin tone, nor my inability to dance or keep any kind of rhythm, nor my disproportionate short legs and tall torso, nor my genetically-inherited obesity, nor my suburban mid-western lisp.  these were not barriers.  these were challenges.  and i have made it my life passion to accept these challenges.<br /><br />the quest to find the perfect pair of pants has ended right here.  i bought 31 of these supreme pants and donated the rest of my pants to a paraplegic charity.  why 31?  because i have my closet organized by days of the month.<br /><br />i have spent every waking and sleeping and comatose-drug-induced minute in these pants.  i\\'ve been trying to get these pants blessed by saint mc hammer but his agent threatened me with a restraining order.  the way i see it, just another one of life\\'s challenges... god bless the u.s.a.<br /><br />whether you wear these to go to the gym and look stylish as f*** or you just want to go out in public and show everyone that you love america, these are perfect for you. i bought these sleep pants as a christmas gift for someone who likes hatley\\'s night clothes.  she loved the pants and loved the dog pattern even more.  very cute.  and i know hatley\\'s sleep clothing is always soft and will last a long time.  fit appears to be perfect. my 11 year old daughter really likes them.  she also got the matching top.  the sizing was exact for her. the pants are very nice. i bought them for my daughter she is expecting in june and for christms i bought her a cedar chest and filled it with baby things she liked the pants very much very soft. great sweats.  did not shrink in the length as most do. a+++ they fit and looked great! however, they had this nasty oil/gasoline smell that never went away! even after multiple washing and even leaving it out on the sun and rain. i ended up throwing them away because that smell was so awful :(<br />if the smell would have gone away, they probably would of been my favorite pair of pants!!! but the smell was so pungent! and nothing i tried worked! my son loved them. just love it! got this as a present for my sister, she loves it said is very comfy.  she does yoga a few times a week. lighter in color than i expected, with the tan color i look like i\\'m not wearing pants, but the fit is good. item was as described, no problems what so ever.  fit and comfort was fine, person liked it very much. size was appropriate. it\\'s freaking awesome!!! another product i\\'m lucky to find on amazon that is, \\\\\\\\\"what you see is what you get\\\\\\\\\". stuff online always photoshop things to make it look better, but not this. it doesn\\'t need any of that. it\\'s really comfortable and stylish. you\\'ll look good in them with 4 inch heels or converse sneakers. :)<br /><br />for reference i am 5\\'5 and 115 pounds. fits perfectly on me. love the color and they are so soft, just love them and would definitely buy more of there products love the material and item great pants. have pockets too.  love that they are harry potter i brought these for my daughter\\'s birthday.  she loved them - said they were just what<br />she was looking for.  very comfortable.  the medium size fits her perfectly. i purchased these after i saw my tiny 5\\'ft friend wearing them. i asked her where she got them and ordered the same pair. though i am a little bit taller and my legs a little thicker than hers (5\\'2 -110,) the pants fit fine. the pants do run long but her and i just cut a few inches from the bottom and let them be. also, depending on what color you get, wear underwear that matches the pants. they are a little see-through in the bum area when you bend over but not too crazy.  these yoga pants are comfortable and have a nice relaxed look to them, i liked them so much i ended up ordering two more pairs. really nice quality as great as always! wish stars were on both sides. material is amazing, will buy again, great us made products! the warriors is one of my favorite films, and i decided to put together an outfit from the one and only baseball furies. i thought i would have to find a set of clothes that look as close as possible and attach the logo later, but surprise surprise, there still are replicas in production!<br /><br />the quality of these pants (and the matching jersey) are outstanding. this is not just a costume, it\\'s a legit baseball outfit. the material is stretchy and thick. the belt loops are also very well made.<br /><br />the fit is about right it seems. i\\'m 5\\'11 205lbs and a medium fits me well. i attached a picture of me wearing it.<br /><br />overall, this is a great set of pants, especially for the price it\\'s a steal! a must-have for any warriors fan. i got these to wear walking back and forth to the bus stop with my grand daughter this winter.  the winter certainly let me try them out.  even on the below zero days i was warm great hat for nighttime or a slightly cooler day.  its super soft and stretches to fit the head and it always gets compliments. i\\'ve been &#34;everywhere&#34; looking in stores & online for petite sweatpants....& here they are! fit is great, bought some for my granddaughter & myself. they wash well & even have pockets!!! they\\'re also made in the usa. not only will i be ordering more but probably other items of clothing. i love the quality and fit. fits well & accurate sizing. comfortable 100% cotton. no buttons or velcro on the pockets! i liked the pants, but they are too small and tight in the crotch area. i usually wear medium, but this style runs small. the size was fine otherwise.  i liked the material and the color otherwise. i love everything about these pants-the fit,material and quality.great price too! the charcoal leggings are a tad bit darker than i was expecting but i love them now. they are soft, comfortable and look great. i even wear them when i do pilates, so great leggings overall. they are kinda long (i\\'m 5\\'6-5\\'7 and they bunch a little at my ankles - i got a small) so if you\\'re shorter they may need to be altered. anyway i would recommend them and wish they had more colors! i want more =) we were happy that they ran small...my daughter is a size 0 and they fit perfect!! i would guess they would fit up to a size 7 perfectly. very comfortable! i bought these for my daughter for her hip hop class and she loves them!!  they are so comfortable and look great! i love the pants!  super cute and comfortable.  i just wish they weren\\'t so long.  i love them though so i am going to keep them and hem them. awesome! so soft and cuddly. fine but long! love them. perfect for my sports attire. finally...workout pants that fit. i am tall, lean. fits my rear perfectly, is comfortable around my waist and thighs. shows just a hint of intrigue in the front without the self consciousness. was complemented immediately on the gym floor as i wore them during a workout. was getting so tired of my high school baggy gym pants, it was time to grow up.... i have worked out hard...have a body to be proud of. along with a good fitting shirt, these pants are perfect.  thanks love them. thank you when it\\'s cool on the bike trail these the best i have used.perfect  fit. i love these pants they are everything as described and i love the way they look on me. i don\\'t regret buying these and they look exactly like the picture and they are soo comfy and that\\'s important to me. i would soo recommend these if you want a new unique look:) love this! very flattering!!! i love em got that nice fit love it just the right size....i wear an xl so that\\'s what i ordered . length is long for me but i\\'m only 5\\' 2&#34; so i expected to have to hem them . super soft & comfy ! really cute too . i have mixed feeling about these. they are exceptionally soft, fit great, hug your curves above the knee and the acid mineral wash is really cool looking. the down side is i have been patching up weak seams in 4 out of 7 pairs ever since i bought these and i have only ever hand washed them too. they look and feel great but the quality of the seams is lacking. i own 2 black/2 navy blue acid washed and three regular black. only had seam issues with the acid washed pairs. really like these, the material and sticking are nice! the length is a little on the longer side, but can hem them. i really like the quality of this product but it fit smaller than expected. otherwise, pretty satisfied love it!! good buy!! they look and feel a little baggy. other than that, they\\'re good quality and comfortable. really durable, tru spec makes great stuff. can\\'t say anything bad about them. i\\'ll continue to buy from them for as long as i continue to airsoft/hunt/paintball i love these!! they are sooooo comfortable! they are a tad long, but i noticed when they went into the wash the first time, they shrank just perfectly in the legs so now they\\'re not as long as they were. as a woman who is 5\\'5&#34;, it\\'s understandable that they would be long because they are technically men\\'s sweatpants. i love them because they are comfy and they\\'re not too heavy or too light, they\\'re just right. :) i am 5\\'3 and 210 lbs they are way too long but i wear them anyway.  they are so soft and wash very nicely, ordered 2 more pair they fit and feel awesome. i love these pants and i will order another pair.  i would not use to work out but only to wear around the house. i bought these pants in several colors and am pleased by the quality of the corduroy material, which is supple and comfortable, as well as by the good assortment of colors and sizes.  mine came with cuffs as advertised and fit nicely.  i\\'ll buy these again in the future. large is a little bit snug on my 5\\'9.5&#34;, 195 lbs frame, but overall the pants fit really well and are quite flattering.  length is perfect for someone of my height.  not so good for summer, given the polyester, but can be dressed up or down when it\\'s cooler out.  would definitely recommend and re-purchase. great deal and very cute. bought 2 sets and they got used and passed down in a quick time. bought more. ***** so  cute! love this romper. ordered medium. fits great. (i am 5\\'3&#34; & 130 lbs with 36 c bust) love fabric. look forward to wearing when weather warms up. i also will try for yoga practice. i have other harem pants but first jumpsuit so hopefully it will work for practice. my husband said it looked good on me. highly recommend. nice fit and length. ladies, but these pants with confidence.  i bought a couple pair for my wife and they look great on her.  she\\'s african american and has a great butt.  these pants show that butt off perfectly.  these pants has taken me watching her work out to the next level.  assuming i can control myself long enough for her to finish! these are the best pjs we have ever bought our baby!  they are super comfy and breathable and just right for nighttime sleeping!  i love this brand and everything i have ever bought from them has been a win! i love these pants. they are perfect!! can\\'t wait to wear them on our vacation. they are elegant and sexy!! i may have to buy another pair ;) once i seen these came in, i put them on and i have yet to take them off haha. the only reason why i gave these a four is because they fit amazingly for my waist, my butt, my legs, but the clinched part at the ankles isn\\'t tight enough. that\\'s the only spot where its baggy and it bugs me. overall, a good product! :) thanks these were exactly what i wanted, i\\'m 5\\'10 & these are perfect length. these pants arrived the other day and my niece is wearing them now as lounge pants. they fit perfectly! i was so happy with this price and quality of these pants. love this pants, they fit like a glove, easy pull-on. they don\\'t roll down at the waist when you start sweating. and sweat you will, that\\'s the reason i bought them. i already see a slight improvement on my cellulite on my legs, thumbs up from me. these are bulky underwear and our daughter perfers to wear regular ones when she can, but these have saved us many times from pee on the floor.  during initial training they couldn\\'t stop a full blown accident, but we only had a couple of these.  after a month or so our daughter was pretty good about telling us when she had to go and accidents were just a little trickle (which is almost always contained by these underwear) before she figures out what is going on and runs off to the bathroom.      so bottom line is these are very handy and will save you money over pull ups. these are by far my favorite yoga pants. i have the navy it fit very well. i bought them in a small and medium and the medium fit much better. i\\'m 5\\'6&#34;, 135 lbs, and usually wear a size 2-4, so i thought they fit pretty small if i liked the medium. they are long enough that when i go to the gym my ankles aren\\'t showing over my shoes like some yoga pants and these are actually really flattering! i\\'ve worn them around cute boys and to run errands without feeling self conscious. these pants are cut a bit small, but the service (3rd party) was great and the quality of the pants was good these pants are super cute and very comfortable. the pants are lightweight cotton and not actually denim which allows for a relaxed fit; the size chart is accurate. they are easily dressed up with a cute blouse and pumps or dressed down with a tank and sandals or sneakers. the side pockets are pretty deep so keys and lipgloss will not fall out. i\\'d recommend these for young, stylish ladies, and mommies on the go. i purchased these pants for my son to use on our trip to the snow.  they kept him dry and warm and were very nice looking.  would definitely recommend them! i made a size change after order was received and joe\\'s responded and provided the size that i wanted. the pattern is more red and less blue.  depending on how much you like red, it could be a problem.  for my case, i like them.  the magic thing about them is that they really fit all.  i\\'m quite big, and my daughter is quite skinny.  we both argued about who deserve those leggings more.  we both tried them on, and they fit both of us.  the material is very good quality, the patterns do not fade out when you strech the fabric.  to me this is a very good quality product, very unique.  they are tight enough to be a good legging.  i\\'ll buy more of them. this is the second pair of lounge pants i ordered and they are so amazing. i feel like i\\'m wearing pajama\\'s and they make my legs look great. my husband loves these pants. they\\'re comfortable and fit well for lounging around the house. soft, thick training pants make potty training a little bit easier! best swimsuit i\\'ve ever bought for my son. he\\'s allergic to sun block and this suit keeps him covered and cool all day. easy on and off, and very cute! well made, good fit, nice crisp camo print, i\\'d buy again. these  are the best tights!!! great for a hulk hogan costume but you can also wear them anytime!!! this company is fast and they have awesome customer service. can\\'t wait to use them again. love it perfect! this suit will work out just perfectly for my grandson\\'s first easter in 2011.  his parents were thrilled with my choice. i love these pants, they\\'re easy to pair with anything and fit very comfortably.<br /><br />two things i wish i could change about them:<br />1) the back has a band of elastic around the waist, so i\\'m not able to tuck my shirt into these because i don\\'t want it to show. would love a normal trouser top on these.<br />2) not sure why, but the middle seam has a habit of twisting to the side of the leg. i think the middle seam is very flattering in elongating my legs, but doesn\\'t do much good when it\\'s twisted to the side. not sure if there\\'s any fix to this, but nevertheless, it\\'s a tad annoying. the waistband stretcher works as described.  it is a little cumbersome to get it attached to the pants, but after that, its all good. these pants fix just right pure dee comfort<br /> your granny could wear a pair as well. these pj\\'s are very cute and soft. they look different (for the better) in person. i was suprised! they have worn well for the month she has had them. the jacket looked great, however, one of the jacket pockets did not have the bottom sewn in.  the pants, however, were very nice. my husband loved the adjustable waist! excellent for the winter. a layer needed this time of year. i really like these pants and would give them 5 stars but they are short. i do not normally wear my pants--yoga nor workout--around my hips--which is where these are worn in the advertised pictures. i would like to order another pair if they were just a bit longer. as they are, i love to wear them around the house and have done yoga in them--however, they are too short to wear shopping or out to lunch:-/ i am only 5\\'6\\\\\\\\\". so if they were longer--even by 2 inches--i would order 2 more pair:-) they wash up nicely--i hang them to dry--and they turn out great:-) beautiful pants i loved it, cheap, good material and good looking these are great snow pants for the price. my only complaint is that it was not clear on the web-site that these were men snow pants so the size that i ordered was too big. otherwise great buy. got the pants for my son for his birthday and he loved them. was a little too big, but i send it to fix.. red unisex indian wrap pants red 100% cotton indian wrap pant with traditional indian trim. these wrap arounds are unisex and can be used for yoga, meditation, tai chi or just comfy everyday wear. as a wrap around they are also flexible in sizing. very pleased with this - fit is loose and comfortable - sizing is correct, but not tight or constricting, just right. my only complaint - get more colors! i`d love to buy this same set again and again. bought several sets of pjs recently, and this is by far my favourite - and the only one worth writing a review about. more colors please! seller was great, no issues, fast shipping. 100% happy with the entire purchase. i bought these for my girlfriend because she likes the yoga pants from victoria\\'s secret but there\\'s no way i\\'m spending $35 on those so i bought her these. she wears these more throughout the house because they are thin and revealing. she wears her vs ones out in public because they are thicker. she said the pants are very soft and comfortable. they were a little long for her at first but we simply cut 3&#34; off them and now they fit just fine. lovely, comfortable, organic cotton yogapants in beautiful royal blue color. size small fits perfect. i am 5\\'5&#34; 125lbs.<br />would definitely recommend these to others.<br />shipping to u.s. was slow, but they came from denmark and well worth the wait! love it, love it, love it.  so, so comfortable and airy and the colors are true vivid.  washes and drys well.  no shrinkage. very comfortable these are comfortable, lightweight, fun pants.  i wear them for yoga, and even sometimes for running around in.  actually today i am cleaning house in them, after my yoga class even if it seems like a 100 degrees in the house right now, these pants remain comfortable, not stuffy. the loose bottom slet you wear these extremely comfy pants where ordinary athletic sweatpants might not go well. i have had several pairs for years of use with no issues. i\\'m 5\\'3 112lbs and the small fits me perfect.  usually i have to wear leggings underneath my yoga pants but these do they job perfectly very pretty but a little small.....these come long and un-hemmed can\\'t go wrong when buying alfred dunner the price was great and i am pleased with the pants fabric tends to stretch out a bit, but they\\'re pretty, soft, and oh so comfy cozy! when i first put them one they where tighter than i wanted but after wearing them the first time they fit like a glove these are my favorite pants very amazing feels grate made very well. very good woodland look and grate for hunting air soft and all kinds of stuff :) i chose 4 stars because the pants were so pretty and nice but they were way bigger than i expected them to be. good quolity will buy it again fast shiping happy with it  would recoment to a friends this was a gift for my great grandson.  he loved it and put it on immediately.  he had requested marine corps items and was very pleased with the sweat pants and t-shirt. pants fit my husband great. fast shipping. great! i got these for my gf and they fit perfectly. they look amazing and she loves them. only if they had more colors available. they really do the job, after a workout it\\'s like a sauna in them there pants!lol but seriously they are awesome and they even cover my stomach too they\\'re very high in the waist. my measurements are 36-28-48 (size 11-13) and i got a medium and the fit is perfect on me. my only let down is how much lint these pants collect. other than that, i like the fit, price, and light weight thickness of the material. bought as a christmas gift for my sister. she loves the owls. super cute, super warm, super comfy. true to size. these are a little larger than the size so if you usually order an extra large you may want to order a large...they are amazing and they\\'re very comfortable and professional wear to work or just out shopping or running errands...you can\\'t go wrong hope you enjoy them as much as i have i gave it 4 stars because it runs small - i do like the quality and design. i debated whether i should return it or use it as motivation to keep on working towards my weight goal. decided to keep it. i\\'m 5\\'5 155lbs and medium fits perfect! perfect length too. i have few neoprene pants- from zaggora, and kutting weight. and they are not cheap. i liked the two mentioned, but it\\'s expensive. i bought this one b/c it was inexpensive and though it would do the similar thing as zaggora and kutting weight. i was right.<br /><br />for fraction of the price of the other brands, i love this. i wear this to hot yoga and it fits like other leggings. it\\'s not as thick as i thought and it\\'s perfect. don\\'t be surprised if you continue to sweat. i actually massage my legs with cellulite cream before i exercise. if you want to sweat and decent price. this is it.<br /><br />i liked this and price was perfect that i bought a long pair with the waist that goes up more. it\\'s great. the mens size was a comfortable fit & am gunna buy more. they are good quality. they\\'re the right length, but a little big around my newborn\\'s waist. overall they are good it\\'s as i expected for a thermal but more of a soft texture.. it\\'s perfect for the cold nights in los angeles theses pants fit perfectly (i\\'m usually a size 8/10 or 10/12).  they\\'re soft, comfortable, well-made.  i\\'ve ordered these in several colors and am totally satisfied with all of them.  the company is excellent.  fast shipping & good return policies.  5 stars - highly recommended! these run just about an inch long, which is great because they can shrink just a little when they are first washed and dried, so this is just what i wanted. they fit great! great for a night out. i wore them to a comedy show and they were perfect. i can\\'t seem to pull them off for an everyday outfit though. i am 5\\'4 and 130lb. the pockets give them a little hard edge army look so they look great with army boots or heels. just perfect, just what i was looking for. these pants are so cute and have a great fit!.  the cropping is perfect, not too short.  i own these pants in two other patterns, and will be adding this print to my collection.  they look great paired with lilly footwear. good quality sweatpants!  only negative was i couldn\\'t get them shipped directly here overseas so i had to ship them to my mom\\'s.  if you\\'re looking for the army issued ones these are not exactly the same.  they\\'re just the same quality, but there are no pockets.  to add they are extremely durable and comfortable sweats which is why i wear them under my normal jeans or workout clothes during cold days. these pants are very well made and i love the design (even though they are a little tight). very nice fit, and good quality design. love it! i\\'m 5\\'7&#34;, about 120 lbs and normally wear a size small. i ordered a size up because of other reviews. the medium is very snug but not unbearable. i really like the individual fit waist band. overall qualtiy and fit is very good. exactly what i wanted! i am very satisfied with my purchase. perfect size and fit a great deal and great price thank you... nice pants. insure you order the exact size you need super soft and comfy and warmmm. bought two first to see how they\\'d look on my wife, she\\'s 5\\'4&#34;, 125lbs. i must say , it pops her back side and gives it a great shape. the material is very soft and looks well made. liked them so much i bought two more. the only thing is that if you get the white one, she\\'ll need to wear white panties or g-string because it does show thru a bit with darker color panties. other than that wow!<br />also, very fast shipping. vendor also stated that if there are any problems with their product they will make good! color is brighter than on picture, so looks a little too &#34;showy&#34; for boys. good thing is these pants are made with very solid and comfortable material. they look great on the person they were bought for, material is not thin, they stretch nicely, smoothly. only fault is that smell of oil. i washed in mr clean finally and that got rid of most of the smell. otherwise quite nice considering the great price. they fit as indicated, are tight except for the ankle part but not binding on a 7. love it! very comfortable and isn\\'t see through on the butt like some leggings contacted the manufacturer about the size of these pajamas being a little smaller on me  than the others i purchased.  he went out of his way to call me back several times (i was unavailable for a few days)--he said they would definitely look into the sizing and make any adjustments that needed to be made. he was very accommodating and went above and beyond to make sure i was a satisfied customer!!  will definitely order from them again!! these pjs have the feel of silk!! these pants were comfortable and fit perfect! i am normally anywhere between size 10-14 not pregnant . i am now 35 weeks along and waited up until i couldn\\'t possibly fit into pants i already owned and finally decided to order these.  the size medium was a great fit, i wish i had bought these sooner. these jeans fit fine. i look good in them.  i need to wear them often. i need another to order another one. these pants are really nice. they fit a bit snugly in the waist, but i plan to have them altered. i like the fact that they are unhemmed as i have trouble finding pants long enough for my tall, very thin son. i have a couple of these pants and they are great!  they are very comfortable and don\\'t look too much like yoga pants or sweats so i wear them out as i would other pairs of pants.  one thing that i wish they would do is not have colored waist bands on the pants and just keep it all black because if you are wearing a lighter colored shirt you can see the colored waistband. i had broken my leg and needed something that was comfortable yet nice to wear in public and these pants did both.  they fit very well without being too tight in certain areas and loose in others.  they also look very stylish as far as comfy pants go and when paired with a nice top no one knows i am crippled up.  wish they had more colors as i have all three pair they offer. love them i got these for my daughter she\\'s 10 and tall and the pants she are supposed to wear are too big or flood on her. so we tried these and fit very well nice quality, very comfortable it\\'s made of a thin material, but is very comfortable and warm. the waist size is perfect, and the legs actually are a bit long on me, which is surprising because i\\'m a tall guy. i am ok with this for pajama pants, though. the design is great, and i\\'d recommend this product to any of my fellow ravenclaws, especially for the price i got it for ($15). these are a nice weight-can wear either season. nice comfy perfect for zumba super comfy :) i love them! i love it.  wore it for a carnival event and i was the center of attraction. it fit so good, it didn\\'t ride up. i love these pants!  i love rhe material, the fit, the style, everything, and will buy more.  the delivery was 2 days with prime. don\\'t buy these pants, because i want them all. fit great and were comfortable and worked good for a pirate themed wedding we went to in las vegas nv oddly enough, when i opened the package, it smelled like chemicals of some sort, i couldn\\'t place it.... they also felt damp which was odd as it was in a package within a package, like it had been sprayed with something.... anyway, i washed them right away and the smell was gone. i really like the style of the pants, they fit well. even though they are skinny pants, you can move around freely in them which can be hard to find in this type of pants. good quality. they are a bit smaller than expected i ordered medium, should have ordered the next size up but do fit albiet rather tightly. nice soft fabric. i love these pants. i already ordered 3 more pares from ur web page the same day i got these in the mail. the mal<br />ke my butt look amazing.  cant wait to order evem more. great prices n fast service. i love these pants! i wear them for hooping and they fit great. love it but kind of see through on the seat region.... this set is incredible for the price.  the colors are very work appropriate (colorful but, not too bright) and there are alot of different color options. the \\\\\\\\\"athletic stripes\\\\\\\\\" are a unique feature which i received many compliments on.  the stripes are not so bold that the top and bottom can still be switched with other pieces for variety.  the fabric was wrinkled with shipping but, i washed before wearing and if immediatley removed from the dryer ironing is not necessary which is essential for me.  a great investment.  i have 2 colors now and will purchase more.  quick delivery. wash well-fit well-good buy these pants are the best. the material is super stretchy, soft and super comfortable. the length is perfect and they are extremely flattering on. i bought the black and grey, and i want to purchase some more. they\\'re perfect for working out, sleeping, and lounging around (without looking like you\\'re too lazy to get dressed lol). i\\'m always impressed with the performance and fit of this brand considering they\\'re so affordable. if you don\\'t want to spend $100 on yoga pants (ahem...lulu lemon) these are a really nice alternative and are just as comfortable. oh and they\\'re not sheer!! i love these pants, they rock but they\\'re not colombian jeans it reads right on the tag made in peru. they need to be re-categorized as i typed in colombian jeans and they came up. my son is 23 lbs at 21 months, so i expected the size 2 to be a little loose, and it was, but that is ok. the waist fits, but is loose around the leg holes, and they are a few inches too long/tall (i can pull them up past his belly button). i am just using them to get him used to underwear and get him excited about potty training. i also bought &#34;plastic pants&#34; which are waterproof, to put over these to contain leaks when he pees. i just don\\'t get the saying on the front of the shirt, other than that they are very comfortable and it was a perfect fit. really comfy and real nice. i have been sweating a little bit with them on but that is not a bad thing when i am outside in the snow. they are easy to put on nothing but good things really. i am glad i got a large too because it is baggy enough for me to move around while i am using it outside shoveling or whatever in the snow. this really is a good product that made me feel comfortable and able to do the things i wanted to do while i was outside in the snow. i\\'m a rather large person.  6\\'4\\\\\\\\\" and 200lbs, and as such, i had a really hard time finding pants that would fit me.  apparently, in order to qualify to shop at a big and tall store, you must first be 100lbs overweight.    anyways, i wear a size 36/36, and order these pants as such, and i was so happy with them that i ordered 3 more.  these pants are absolutely fantastic.  the pockets are deep, and i have yet to have anything fall out of them.  the pants are heavy, and they will withstand a lot of abuse.  the pants can be a little stiff when they are brand new, but they loosen up quite nicely after a few wearings/washings.      like others have said, these pants shed stains pretty well.  also, these pants are not water proof, but if you\\'re quick, you can brush the majority of spilled liquids off them before it soaks in.      to sum it up, these pants are fantastic.  you will not be disappointed. awesome my daughter loves them i love it!!! me encanta!!! comfortable lounge pants and the fleece stays soft after repeated washing and drying. i plan on buying another pair soon. love my belt, been complimented ^-^<br />would love for the people who make these belts to make a rick and morty belt my son is 22lbs and in the 97% for height, so he\\'s a big 10 month old. these pants fit him great, though they are a little long. the elestic is not too tight which i really like, i think he has a little room to grow. they are nice and thick, since he\\'s crawling all over the place it\\'s nice he has a little padding and these are roomy enough that he can get around. i will be buying more of these in other colors! i purchased these so i would feel more comfortable wearing white pants. nice and heavy material lot better than any i\\'ve seen in the stores. definitely going to buy different colors. these are just too perfect. they fit nice and tight like leggings but are just thick enough to be..well jeggings/worn with a shorter shirt.<br />i like the fact they have pockets to add to them being more on the pants end but still a great tight fit. if i\\'m not mistaken, this is a french brand, non? the day we got these stylish jeans, our dapper little tyke sported them to the local, hip cafe(well, as much as a non-walking, two-toothed tyke can \\\\\\\\\"sport\\\\\\\\\" anything). they are well made, the denim is top quality and the striped lining is extra cute but not too heavy. after getting these, i went to the brand\\'s website to sign up for their newsletter. i use to buy mostly l\\'oved baby but this quality is much, much better. this is my new favorite kid\\'s fashion brand. he loves it so much that he does not want to take it off i like better than carhart these pants fit great, they washed and dried great, i am sure they will get a lot of use from them. the size is about what you would expect : &#34;dancer&#34; fit<br />order a size large if you have bigger calves ;)<br /><br />great quality, the pockets are dope, and they legitimately make you feel so comfortable dancing (and watching netflix ;) )<br /><br />5/5 definitely love it fast shipping 2nd pair & i love them. the length is awesome! i ordered this item for my daughter and we wanted to love it but i have one issue with the pants. now i must confess that i do not possess any knowledge about fabric blends so when i read in the product description that this product was \\'cotton\\' and then further in the description it detailed the mix of cotton, polyester, and spandex that this item is made of i really had no idea what that meant. turns out these are \\'stretch pants\\'. the same kind you can buy at your local target or walmart for a lot cheaper than $22. don\\'t get me wrong; these pants look great with a pink ladies jacket but for what i paid i feel that if i knew how to sew i could have bought these pants locally, sewn the small slits needed at the knee and created my own \\'50\\'s style capri pants\\' for a lot cheaper than $22 plus shipping. so i was really excited to order these, i ordered a black pair and a teal pair. the colors are great. teal is really really nice (alittle darker than the pictures but it\\'s actually nicer than you expect). fabric is soft and comfy. i am 5\\' 9&#34; and average size, however i was blessed/cursed a big booty. from the front, the pants look cool, but my butt fills out the back so it doesn\\'t quite look like the pictures shown. it looks more fitted so i don\\'t think i have the full harem pants look right. i initially was going to return for a bigger size, but the actual pants themselves are made to fit as expected so if i went bigger, i feel like the waist and ankles would be too loose.<br />i would definitely suggest these pants to anyone interested, and order them as you would normally (if you are a medium, order a medium) but if you have a booty, just expect to fill the back out more than the picture shows. i bought these for my dance classes, and they are so comfy that i am wearing them now to hang out in. if you are thinking about buying, buy. strongly recommended. i am probably going to order another color at some point. bellisima i love the way they fit and wish they had more available. they\\'re a little short, but they fit pretty much the way i expected. it fits just right. a bit long but i\\'m 5ft tall and that\\'s to be expected and i don\\'t consider that a problem. love the material. i\\'m getting other pants in different patterns. excellent pant for the price ! very soft and comfortable ! i like everything except at 6\\'1\\\\\\\\\" these are a good 6\\\\\\\\\" too long. i often buy big & tall because of length but yikes these are for the real giant. great product. very well made, and a nice soft material. yes they were what i was looking for , gave 5 stars cause my wife look\\'s great in them , also love the price , great buy thanks amozon i bought these for my husband for christmas.  they are such a nice fabric and very well made. i saw from other reviews that many thought the sizes ran small, and i like my pj\\'s loose,so i ordered an xl instead of a l. i\\'m glad i did, as it exactly the looseness i wanted. the fabric feels really nice. i was worried that the satiny fabric would be too hot to sleep in for someone who suffers from hot flashes, but it\\'s really light and that isn\\'t a problem. these pants are cool. these was arrived fast. i like a lot the color and the size is ideal for me. excellent light weight best fitting yoga pants that i have ever owned. wish they weren\\'t so long though. i am 5\\'8&#34; and these drag the ground on me. these are great shorts for under short dresses, skirts, or costumes. the fabric is thin which i like because doesn\\'t add bulk. goes up to the waist which i like because no panty/hip hugger lines. great pants for the price.  very comfortable but a little long (i\\'m 5\\'5&#34;) but with heels they work great. good love these pants. ive bought all patterns and wear them all the time. perfect &#34;fat pants&#34; to wear when you are bloated like a seal or had one too many pizzas. be sure to wash on gentle and hang dry otherwise they will wear quickly comfortable. soft. quick shipping great product.  do not need extra anything.  so nice.  just drop them in the washer. they work great and so easy to keep clean worn once already, usually where a 32\\\\\\\\\" waist for jeans. great pants, kept me very warm, legs fit over my bindings, but i could button up so they didn\\'t get caught up under my shoes. love these pants. one con, didn\\'t have compatible gators with the dc jacket i bought, but even though they didn\\'t, i did not get any snow under my clothes. got the pants really quickly and they are the most comfortable sweat pants.  nice and warm on the inside as well! fits nice. good fabric. this is a high quality product and was built to last.  they are non-gender and my daughter says they are comfy pants! i\\'m 6\\'5\\\\\\\\\" tall and nearly 300 lbs and often have difficulty in finding pants that will accommodate a tall and hefty build (most big & tall clothes are for tall and thin, or short and fat only.) these pants are very comfortable and stay up without a belt - i hate wearing belts. the pants are well made and are comfortable enough for lounging around in, yet are nice enough to wear out for any casual occasion. these pants are of a very good quality, great comfort and style, and are a nice addition to those of us who hate wearing belts. highly recommended as a more stylish option to wearing sweat pants! excellent good lindas! these will be perfect for summer good super soft. colors better than depicted and absorbent. my 3 yo still has accidents so these are great. also help with nap time if your lo is not yet quite dry when asleep. the pants are made of good quality material.  pants are very comfortable and haven\\'t shrunk or faded.  i recommend them to all interested. these shorts are dope. my girlfriend made me buy them but now i want another pair. they are roomy and comfy and for the ladies... stylish. they are a bit tight these are very nice sweat pants. i wear a medium but should have ordered the large.  i will use the mediums i ordered as gifts! perfect fit for me. delivered to my door quickly. all my alfred dunner pants have been great. i wanted these for my 4 day cruise. can\\'t wait to wear them. thanks. fit well, comfortable. good as advertised...no issues. i see the other reveiwer thought these yoga pants were for children. they are not. i thought they were for adults. they are not. it is my fault for not noticing the word or knowing what &#34;junior&#34; means. judging from the pair i received i would now say it means they are for 12 to 13 year olds. i see there are now measurments included in the description. i did not notice them when i made my purchase (can\\'t swear they were not there) but they would have been helpful. i had to return them.<br />i should mention they are very cute and comfortable looking yoga pants. the logo is colorful with applejack (a favorite) right up front. team pony is lettered down the right leg. there cute but definitely see through i will being more in the future so tired of the baggy issue type pants, that are tight around waist and baggy everywhere else, i am slimmer and like not having mc hammer tactical pants on, im 511 and 165 and these fit perfect in the 32x34. they are def not slim, but more fitted, works out good. will be buying more. awesome awesome awesome none love the gaucho pants!! these are great for my 6\\'1\\\\\\\\\" wife. she always has a problem finding tall enough pants. these fit the bill. the waist is high enough for her as well most comfortable pants ever. we ended up using these for a different purpose than their usual one, and they worked very well.  we were on a white water rafting trip, and for reasons not worth going into, one member of our party hadn\\'t put the rain pants on before we hit the rapids.  when we got off the boat, she was freezing, and stripped out of her swim suit and put on her rain gear, including these pants (in women\\'s size small), just for the warmth.  they were comfortable enough that she wore them off the boat for the next five hours in july in arizona and was very happy to have them. i am 5\\'2. they are just a bit long but i am short!  they are very comfortable not thin an no see thru! i would recomend these.! i was looking for a cheaper snow plant that i could pull on over my jeans for snow blowing or shoveling.  the price was right so i thought i\\'d give them a try.<br /><br />my jeans typically run 38-40&#34; (depending on the brand) for the waist, and 34&#34; length.  i purchased the xl guide gear fleece lined cargo snow pants and i\\'m easily able to pull them on over my jeans.  i probably have an extra 2-3&#34; in length, but i like the extra length for added mobility.<br /><br />the build quality appears to be decent and there were no flaws that i could find on first inspection.  the shell of these pants is a lightweight nylon.  i wouldn\\'t consider them water proof, but if you spray them with water repellant it should keep you pretty dry while blowing snow or shoveling.  the inside of the pants are lined with red fleece and they are very comfortable.  there are two light weight cargo pockets on each leg and the bottom of the legs expand so you can pull them over your pack/snow boots.<br /><br />as mentioned these pants are a little long on me, but that\\'s actually what i was looking for.  the pants fit loose enough over my jeans that they give me very good mobility in a  light weight, warm snow pant.  they allow to bend and move without any binding at the waist or knee.  you\\'re not going to win a fashion contest while wearing them, but they certainly get the job done.  these pants would also be great as a cheap pair of emergency snow pants for the truck or car.<br /><br />overall, if you\\'re looking for a light weight snow pant to go over your jeans, these pants are great for the price, i couldn\\'t be happier.  if you\\'re looking for something more heavy duty and water proof, then you probably wouldn\\'t be happy with these. i love these sleep pants. i don\\'t wear them out in public because generally i don\\'t wear sleep pants out in public, but if i did wear sleep pants out in public, these would be it. :-) shipped fast, perfect as described. thanks! corduroy pants are so comfortable, and these pair are no exception. stretchy waist for when you have eaten a big dinner, but durable enough to last throughout some intense walking, these pants are amazing. i usually use size m / l and fits me perfectly bought for wife she lives them! if there was a 6th star i would deff give it to this product<br />fits like a champ these are wonderful!  i\\'m 5\\'3 and 136 lbs. i feel so cute in these. they are warm too!  highly recommended this comfy skirt and leggings combo is really cute and fits just right. kept me warm and stylish in chiberia this winter! :) i am size 14 tall and bought the size large pants.  they fit wonderfully, the fabric is lovely, they have good pockets.  i am very happy with them. wish i would have got the 2xl but over all they are sweet, i get respect everywhere i go in these bad boys i love them , i wear them for soccer and i intend to buy a lot more of these ! i received this product in exchange for my honest review, i love these pants. i am a big size woman, i thought when i first got these they were gonna be to little. but they fit real good. i love the material and the color of these pants. i would definitely recommend these. i bought a small and it\\'s a true small.  very comfortable and stretchy.  these are perfect for my yoga classes.  glad i bought 2 pair. this a nice pajama pants however from past experience do not dry. i bought this for a pirate costume. it is well made and fit perfectly, and since they are basically balloon pants they will fit a wide variety of sizes. nothing bad to say. buy it. i love these pants! they fit exactly as they should and are professional.  nobody at work could even tell i was wearing maternity pants!  i love them.  so comfortable! great, flexible-fitting pants--for those brief times when you\\'re between sizes they adjust for comfort.  great styling and fully functional with lots of pockets. so comfy and are a little long but i\\'m short so it happens a lot. fast shipping. packaged well. product as described. perfect!!! love. it. the material is thin but it\\'s so comfortable and so very cute. will be buying more. great purchase, fast delivery. no problems. these are very soft and quite comfortable!  i did not want to take them off.  i would have given 5 stars although after a day of wear they stretched out & became way too big on me.  still very comfy though, i will just have to purchase the smaller size next time! i bought this item some time ago (bought it when i was 4 months pregnant, my child is over 2 months) and let me say these pants are very nice black dress pants, and very comfortable. these were actually the most comfortable pair of maternity pants that i bought. i still wear them now (they\\'re a little big now that i have my pre-preggo body back), but the spandex still clings to my tummy and keeps the pants from falling.  these were nice enough to wear out to church or if i wanted to look nice, and were durable enough to wear to work. i loved these pants and still do. i purchased the kingdom hearts pajama bottoms for my son.  the material is soft, and they didn\\'t shrink in the wash.  my son says they are really comfortable. i love them!!! if you wanna make a statement & support our 2nd amendment then these are for you. covered well but when bending over were a little sheer in the back. love love these pants! comfortable great material! fast shipping received lots of compliments to! are very comfortable and thick compared to other brands will definately order again but in grey :) i\\'m 5\\'5\\\\\\\\\", 130lbs, muscular build, and the size small fits great.<br /><br />the material is a little bit thin but i can\\'t complain for the price. these are just fine.  they look nice and the price was great.  i am very happy with them.  wish they came in even more colors. excellent quality. exactly as described.  extremely quick to ship. will order again from them! i think the quality of the joggers are great. i am short so i got the medium joggers, and they fit just fine. love so much bought other colors great item. high quality. good these shorts are perfect for wearing under my sun dresses.  no panty lines, and i don\\'t have to worry about flashing people when i pick up my toddler or am sitting in a chair! has proven helpful in the potty training process.  gives the opportunity for child to feel wetness without the mess. this pants is soft and stretchy and comfy... fit me perfectly...üëç these are very comfortable and can be dressed up or down. this sweatsuit fits small as other reviewers have mentioned. i ordered a size up and it fits me perfectly. it is great for running around the house, which is all i need it for. cute super adorable.<br />im 5&#34;7 115lbs and these fit just fine.<br />the colors are cute as well as the design.<br />love then! these are the most comfortable pants on planet earth. these athletic cargo pants are a great addition to my workout wardrobe. these by far are the  most comfortable workout pants i have. i wish they sold the pants in more than one colors. excelente! the most cozy pants ever!! our little ones loves playing in them.    they do run a little big though but very cute baggy as well. the fabric is pretty thin.  overall happy with the product!  waist fits pretty accurately, legs a little large.  great buy! these lovely disney pants/tights are wonderful. perfect fabric everything! i love it they look so cute on my toddler who is 18months and daughter who is 6 months :). i will be buying more :). these pants gave me a muffin-top.  i am a size 14 with a 34\\\\\\\\\" waist, and these pants sit below the waist where i get much thicker!  but they are lovely pants, and the woman ( a fellow belly dancer) i gave them to (who is about a size 10) just loves them (hence the 4 stars!) she told me she even wears them around the house because they make her feel so good! i absolutely love these pants, i also have them in white! great fit, good quality i will def purchase other colors. i just want to let everyone know this is a very nice sweatsuit.  buying it was so easy and we received it right a way.  there was a little oopsy and we received 2 jackets by mistake however the minute i let them know it was like the next day the pants were at my house.  i hadn\\'t even returned the extra jacket at that point.  i would definitely do business with them again.  great seller! pants fit really good and the bottom is not tight on the ankles. nice pants. i\\'ve been happy with all of the luvable friends products, and these pants are no exception.  they are well made and fit my growing baby (3 mo. and 14 lb!) very well also.  the length is great in that they stay around his ankles and don\\'t ride up to his knees like some pants.  my only complaint is that they aren\\'t available (at least right now) in sizes larger than 6-9 mo. i am very satisfied good quality material it does run small so size up  and i am six feet tall and the length fits me well i have used these pants for almost a decade now and have 6 pairs of them in my closet at any time.  they are comfortable and durable and look great.  as a fat guy i would not wear anything else for my business casual dress. good fit and soft. i love these pants! they are my go to pants for exercise , errands or even just lounging around . great fit great price 1 perfect. great value. great delivery these are terrific, nice fabric and fit.  i wish they came with a longer inseam for a tall woman. i like the pocket that attaches to the tie bands. nice camo print on a good quality material. fit as expected, baggy and slightly narrow at the ankle. wide waistband make them very comfortable. these pants are really nice.  well made and very soft material.  the length is perfect.  i ordered a large (i normally wear size 10-12 pants).  i can\\'t wait to wear these.  i know that my honey will love them.  thank you so much for making beautiful and quality clothes.  they were so nicely packed too! these look way better than the picture.<br />i can wear a large or extra large, and this large fits just fine. i was concerned about how they would be because they are so cheap, you never know what the material will look like but these are awesome!! be advised though, the mocha color is actually a really really light tan, not brown like the photo. they are super soft, feel like cotton (but are rayon) and they look good on. only thing i am disappointed in is the length, i am pretty short, 5\\'4 and these are short on me, so they would not work for a tall girl. other than that, a great buy and will enjoy them as a casual hang out kind of pant. don\\'t know why they are called &#34;cigarette&#34; style, but i like the fit anyway. i anticipated pants that\\'s i could wear over my jeans to play with my kids outside. initially i thought they were too small because i could not get them on over my jeans. after i realized these are probably for people who ski all day in their tight thermal underwear underneath, i tried them on again with my yoga pants. they fit amazing. i love them. i was warm and dry playing in the snow in 5 degree ohio weather. would highly recommend. my husband saw these in store and they were more expensive and they didn\\'t have his size so we looked online and they were cheaper! he loves them, he wears them to work all the time. nice pants for the price. i like the extra pocket lower on the leg. good value. it\\'s too small i couldn\\'t be happier! the legs have cords to let you u tighten the ends so you can adjust them how you please, the waist fit just right and they look great too. very comfortable looking to go out in them great delivery time. no complaints great buy, great price, if you like the tight jean look and the feel of jeggings then this is for you. i have bought her a lot of different types and styles and these are the best. best price, best looking i have bought her to date. i have paid 4times as much and didn\\'t get the look or feel until i got her these. thanks amazon! i look here first from now on. i\\'m going to buy another one, love it!!! these are so sturdy, strong & long enough! these were by far the best quality<br />camo pants that i have ever purchased! these run big and they stretch out as you wear them. especially in the bum. so you have to wash and dry after every wear. i\\'m ordering a medium instead of large. i\\'m 5\\'7 and 149 lbs. i read others\\' reviews of this product, and found they recommended ordering 1 size up. i bought these for my daughter-in-law for christmas.  she normally wears a medium (and this is post-baby), so i ordered a large and they are just right.  she likes them - the cotton is comfy, and being yoga pants, they suit her current lifestyle. the pants are great! got them for zumba. i thought they would be more slouchy in crotch area but that\\'s ok. i will be ordering more colors for sure! the colours are good<br />they stay after as many wash as u like.<br />fiting is very comfortable.<br />the material is great.<br />the designs are very beautiful.<br />i got a lot of complements our 4 month old is long so we had to move up to 6-12 month kickeepants already. i think it all depends on the individual baby\\'s size, however they do seem to run bigger than other baby clothes (ie my son cannot fit in carter\\'s 6 month sized clothes)<br />these are my favorite brand of baby clothes for both softness and quality, our little guy seems most comfortable in these too.<br />i wash these in cold water and hang them to dry overnight to keep them vibrant. this might seem like too much extra work but i do it gladly just for these articles of clothing because i am obsessed. they are luxurious, and in my opinion, worth the extra tlc.<br />a huge &#34;plus&#34; that separates these footies from other brands with similar styles in our baby\\'s wardrobe: the actual feet on them are long like little elf shoes, they don\\'t crunch his toes (again, our baby is long)<br />i started off with one of these that i found in a high end baby boutique\\x1b\\x1b\\x1bnow i\\'m surfing amazon all the time to swoop them up whenever i see them on discount! love the shirt fit as expected, however the pants were sized too small. i also ordered a different color from the same company and the pants were drawstring instead of elastic. they fit much better even though they were the same size. make sure you get a size up if you are worried. the quality of the scrubs are great and comfortable other than the sizing. i ordered these for the summer and am very pleased with the product! they ended up being a soft cotton unlike the stretchy athletic lycra i had expected. they are a vivid egg yolk yellow and not faded at all! arrived neatly folded, unripped with stable seaming. i\\'m rather short so require lower rise pants to better fit my proportions and these right above my hip but still under my belly button. very comfortable and not to tight! i had not expected these to have functioning pockets or a functioning zipper and button, so that was a pleasant surprise! however when i wear them they tend to creep down so i\\'m hoisting them back up during the day, this is not because they loosen but due to the tight cotton knit of the fabric. so i may need a belt with them. i ordered an xl, i\\'m a us 16 with 48 inch hips and these fit well but nip in a bit tight around the main waistband and front seam (causing a slight camel toe if i\\'m not careful) so for all my ladies out there, be sure you have some cute tunic tops to pair with these just in case! i tend to wear flowy midthigh tops because of how the waistband behaves on me. my legs measure 30 inches from the outseam to the ankle and these slacks are about two or three inches to long. still cute if i scrunch the ankle with the extra fabric though. i\\'m very pleased with these! however because they tend to ride around on me a bit when i wear them, i give this four instead of five stars. probably the best training pants i\\'ve owned. ever.  i train hard but i can tell these pants will make any arse look like you do serious squats.  shipped within 2 days, despite the fact that i ordered on a saturday.  i got black stone wash and purple stone wash.  not sure olive will do me any favors, light colors don\\'t work right on skin tight pants no matter how fit you are.  update: ordered another pair, disappointed to say the least. short short short.  i see other reviewers complainingabout these pants being  too long, asking the seller to do something about having shorter pants available - well, good for you peeps, the pants are now short.  i can\\'t wear them that short.  i guess i\\'ll have to see what other t-party distributors have to offer. excellent product important to the family would buy again if needed, durable and recommend it to everyone is required to have i get a size bigger afraid that it will shrink after one wash and it did (not much tho), so now it fits perfectly. i\\'m 5\\'4 and about 125 pounds i bought m. it\\'s my daughter\\'s first year in jazz dance and she loves how the pants gives her room to dance freely pants came on time and fit perfectly ! great pants.  great service on time as promised. i loved this item at american apparel i kid you not these were 80 dollars ! i tried them on at aa and these feel and look the exact same i even bought a second pair i still want more . at first i was worried about the size but they fit perfect im a size 2 . i am very happy with my new pair of casual pants!  i bought a medium petite, and they probably do run slightly large, but i\\'m thrilled with the length, perfect for my 5\\'2\\\\\\\\\" height (i typically wear a size 12 or 14 short in pants.)  i will use them for the gym or weekend shopping this winter, but they look nice enough to be a little dressier, if you want.  i love how soft they are and the fact that they have pockets, something i can\\'t always find in sweatpants.  i\\'m going to buy some more colors. perfect ! very cute and was fast shipping! thank you! my son loved it! i disagree with the previous review.  from the first moment i put a kicky pants footie on my girl i was hooked.  the bamboo fabric is fantastic.  it\\'s stretchy without feeling like spandex.  the clothing fits my growing baby much longer than other baby clothes.  i\\'d say that temperature is very well regulated in bamboo (in fact i think that is characteristic of the fabric).  the feet definitely look big, because they are big enough to grow into!  and, in my opinion, they look really cute.      this last thing will sound strange, but i love that when she is wearing her kicky pants i can feel \\\\\\\\\"her\\\\\\\\\" when i am holding her.  other clothing isn\\'t as forgiving or is thick and stiff (like denim) and that is what i feel when she wears the other stuff. i love the material, it\\'s so soft! this outfit is so adorable, i will be purchasing more! such a steal! and the quality is pretty good, especially at these rock-bottom prices of ~$12.00! i bought two pairs, one in grey and the other in black, and i couldn\\'t be happier with them. i\\'ve already gotten a good use out of them on a trip to canada last week where it snowed a lot. perfect inseam length, too, for petite heights. i\\'d say these ponte leggings may be too short of your leg inseam is &#62;32&#34;. but if you\\'re going to wear boots over them or want a capri length and you\\'re above 5\\'5&#34;, they\\'re perfect for those purposes!<br /><br />last, they hold their color and size well even in a warm wash cycle and tumble dry low dryer setting. small rear pockets that don\\'t make your derriere look huge or shorten the length of your legs. i love \\'em! perfect they run a little bigger than i thought, but overall are very comfortable.  i get many, many compliments on them. ive bought so many pairs of thse brand pants and i love them. girlfriend wanted purple i wanted pink so i orderd my usual size. on hers a large because this girl has hips. soulda went with a medium.  they are cut to mens sizes so when she said large i didnt argue just ordered what she wanted.  she loves them and will have to hem them or roll em up. other then that she wants other colors too. killer deal and killer product. i was a little worried at first with the reviews that say these pants are very thin and see through.  these pants are thin but i ordered my size and they are definitely not see through.  i absolutely love the way they fit my body and they are the perfect length. love these. perfect for newborns and so much easier than trying to keep socks on! got them in many different colors. excelente worked fine for two days then just quit, i retuned to company for a replacement, received and so far is working ok.<br />cost me 13.00 to return, not happy about that.<br />robert cooper love it super comfortable classic alfred dunner quality and fit. love them i am small and they fit fine, but wouldn\\'t fit much larger than a woman who wears a small. b this is a great maternity pants.<br />the material is soft and it fits well, lots of room to grow into.<br />i bought a small seeing i was a small pre pregnancy and its fits great.<br />the belly band is very stretchy and comfortable, something like a camisole material nice and stretchy. i absolutely love these pants!! they fit perfectly and make my back end look fabulous! would definitely recommend them!! i\\'m going to buy some in every color ad soon as i get the chance! fine after a wash these leggins are very thin but cool as heck.  they are a bit long for someone just under 5 ft tall but she didn\\'t mind. i finally found what i was looking for. i spent hours of each day for quite a while. i wasn\\'t looking to spend that much for lounging pants\\', but i wear them due to my problems as a disabled veteran. i tried them on on and they were huge. they didn\\'t offer 1xt or i would have exchanged them. these knothe pants are made as stated in the desciption, believe me when i say buy them. remember their cut is for big and large men. i am one, just not that big. i know there were reviews that people were swimming in this outfit, but it was too cute and i bought it anyway. i am 5\\'3&#34; and as a romper this is super cute! there is no way i would (or could) ever wear these as pants, but as a romper it is just like the picture shows. the fabric is light and opaque and pretty. the smocking as a strapless defines the shape down your back, baby doll in the front below the bust. very cute, and casually dressy with a belt and heels. definitely going to receive compliments when i wear it - i already know! awesome pants!! fits true to size and looks really nice on the booty (: i always worry about buys pants online because you never know if it\\'s going to fit properly, but these pants fit me the best of all maternity items i\\'ve purchased so far. the material is comfortable, it\\'s sewn well, and after throwing it in the wash at least 4 times it still looks great and hasn\\'t shrunk or warped in any way. my only complaint is that there are 2 colors and the mushroom is not available in my size (med) and i don\\'t want to buy a second pair in the same color. i wish mm would make more of this pant in more colors. good quality and comfort. excellent material and the same product offered. robust but very comfortable equal to those used by navys wish they had pockets cute pajamas but wish they were a little softer. fit better than expected.  extremely soft and cozy will order more. a tad on the small side, but i love the way they feel. the most comfortable long underwear i ever owned. i bought three pairs! super comfy. they cling in the right way but also lose enough that i felt comfy in them after having a c-section.  it is thin cotton that won\\'t last too long, i mean, it\\'s clear these aren\\'t $50 yoga pants. but for the price, they\\'ve been absolutely great to wear post-partum around the house and on walks in the neighborhood. i bought these to wear as ski pants. the fit nicely, and the wide bottom part of the trousers mean they fit nicely over my ski boots. pretty pleased with these. to give you an idea of sizing, i\\'m 6\\'2&#34;, and generally buy my jeans at 32x32. the large size is maybe a *little* long, and waistband a little tighter than i\\'d like, but i expect the elasticity to degrade somewhat.<br /><br />gay dude hit on me at the gym while i was wearing these, so i think the bulge projection is premium with these bad boys. i bought a very cute dress for nye but it turned out to be a tad short for my taste so i ordered these shorts to wear underneath.  the material and fit are just what i was looking for. like ok i bought one pair and they\\'re sooo soft and comfortable i wanted to wear them every day, so i bought several more. my sister borrowed them and wants to get her own pair now too. it feels like a t-shirt only pants, and i love the boot cut. i only had them a short time. they seem to do what was expected, i will let you know if i love, love, love them if i lose weight. seems to be decent quality, and they are very stretchy, but they are pretty small. they show your shape very nice. i bought these as an impulse buy with another product, and they are incredibly comfortable, and i love the pockets.  i have gotten so many complements on these pants!  i wanted something comfortable to wear to work but still look &#34;appropriate&#34;, and these fit the bill, and for this price, they are great! love these pants my daughter is 5\\'2&#34; and a size 1 but curvy, these pants fit her just as we expected, we were very satisfied with the purchase. these are the softest & coziest pajama bottoms i own. i fell so in love with their comfort that i ordered a second pair & also ordered them for a xmas gift! really liked these and my granddaughter loved them. beautiful and well made. price is great for what you could be paying here in us and even better that you won\\'t find this style in stores. so if you are like me and like wearing things no one else has, then this is the place to buy stuff. will be buying more. also, i wear a size 13 in pants and 15 in shorts, the lg fits fine. snug around the bottom but that is good for me. they are long but you can cut them yourself to fit you and sew them up or just leave them that way, the material isn\\'t the kind that will fray and you can\\'t tell the difference. i like it the style very much, it\\'s good for summer time. the material is very thin.<br />it cover good love these especially for overnight they are a little on the bigger side but not by much. would highly recommend. pretty color, one of my favorites. very nice quality, and long lasting! these are my staple pants. they are not jeans, so if thats what you\\'re looking for these arent them. but i love them even more. they are tight through the legs and give enough room around the waist so i dont have a muffin top. and, enough stretch through the whole pant so you never feel like your pants are painted on. the fabric was perfect, would hold everything in without suffocating, and i wish i could get a little black dress made out of this stuff. i was obsessed with these pants. like obsessed. i wore them almost every day. i had 3 pairs, and i cut one pair into shorts. sadly, my pairs are now trash, as my dog chewed one up, lost the other in a move and now all i have left are some shorts. get these back! i purchased these tights to work-out in during pole dance class and they fit great.  the material is soft and light.  it helps that they are very sexy and go great with my pole shoes.  a good buy. my son loves this belt! his friends have given him many compliments! just got the pants in today, there really good and durable. i got it for airsoft and regular use, they look really good on me and sure will look on anyone. very nice for the price. propper is the main supplier of america\\'s clothing/camo for the military and the best.      pros: everything    cons: none i instantly was able to do roundhouse kicks as soon as i put these on... unfortunately my gf was in the wake of my roundhouse fury wrath! sorry babes! othee than that, no complaints! these are very cute! we wore these pants for my dance class, and we all loved them. the slit is sexy and it looks great while dancing. we would wear either spankies or leggings underneath them so we don\\'t show too much skin. however, the size i ordered (a small i believe), was pretty big. i just pinned the waist and the openings for the feet and it was fine. i little bit shorter than i expected but nice and comfy fits perfectly and i love the style but it attracts lints. thank they\\'re cheap....and sexy. i dig. i am hard to fit for my age and these are great.they have just enough spandex to make them fit . loved these for my 3 month old twins! i ordered the 0-3 month and it was pretty true to size and we wore till 4 months love the product and will order again. thank you. runs short love these pants...just ordered a second pair.  perfect for travel, work outs, errands around town, even grabbing a bite to eat, do wish they came in other colors however. great feel! very soft, haven\\'t washed yet as they are too large for my son to wear at this time. light weight, not too heavy. the pants are so soft and came over a month early! i couldn\\'t be more happy with my purchase!! hermoso buena calidad me fascinan los recomiendo my son is right between needing pull-ups and being completely dry. because of the double layer, these offer much better leakage protection than the more commercial underwear.  they are also much softer.  the all cotton band does not cut into his stomach like some of the elastic in cheaper brands.  i ordered them big because i have found gerber to run a bit small, however, these seem to be true to size and the 3t is a little too large.  if you are planning on using them solely for potty training, a plastic pant cover would probably be the safest route. i purchased these for my wife, and she looks great in them, they really do loo like dark wash jeans and i just can\\'t see any difference. my wife loves them because they are so soft and comfy that she cam lounge around and cuddle with me in them yet still answer the front door and look good when the neighbors come knocking. highly recommended. i was very surprised how soft and comfortable they are worth to buy i love these, although they are too big. came in the mail fast! i like leggings ,fits perfectly,i recommend to<br />buy it and i know you fell the same way i do,<br />pretty lite material not only are they superior quality...but the seller was wonderful to deal with! i\\'ll definitely be ordering again in the future because of the  fantastic customer service, prompt shipment, and beautiful merchandise! a real five * star experienced seller and company! thank you so much...you  made my week! patti bought for my mom. she had a pair but wanted the next size up. she is happy with the pants. very fast delivery as well. these pants fit very well come to natural waist, and the drawstring along with elastic helps keep in place.  will try another color these pants are a must have for summer . i purchased these pants a while back and have been pleased ever since. these pants are very chic and you wear it with a colorful top and nice shoes ,they are very comfortable to wear. this is a very nice item but i would like to suggest that the seller offer tall sizes so everyone has the choice of wearing it as a jumpsuit or pants. i brought my newborn home in this gown, with a kicky pants footie underneath.  it is wonderfully soft.  i wish all baby clothes were made of this material. bought these for her for xmas, along with a sweater i bought her at armani.  these almost exact leggings where showcased with the sweater i bought her, but price was kind of high, so decided to get them from here =]  they look good on her.  and thats what matters =] bought for elderly parent & she was very pleased... excellent! hubby loves it üòè fit great! super cute i got these pants for my boyfriend who loved them right away but we noticed that after just wearing them for two days of sleep there was a hole in the crotch area. he is fine with sewing it back up but the material could have been made a bit stronger, i don\\'t regret my purchase. love these comfortable pants. can wear casually or dressy. a lot of compliments and i love that they don\\'t wrinkle. it\\'s slightly spandexy and will hug up top, kinda holds jiggles in then flows. i\\'d say you could wear them spring, summer and some of fall. these have a tight waist but if you cut out the cinch; they are perfect!!! i am 5\\' 3\\'\\' and wear a 10/12. very pleased with fit and length! got a medium. but it fit really well and it is comfortable. i wear these as night shorts a lot! i would definitely recommend this product! i read all the reviews, and they scared me (sizing wise), so i got a large, when i am usually a small in underwear and bikini. this fit perfectly well! i am pretty sure a medium would have worked fine as well. i am definitely going to buy another pair in m probably. i got just what i needed, so happy!!!<br />very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good comfy excellent product !!! you get what you pay for and these were worth the $15. i have yoga pants that i\\'ve spent more money on and these are actually really nice for what i paid for, the shipping was really fast and i\\'m very satisfied. love these pants. a tad long on my legs but i also think i might have short legs? great material. love them. it was as if it was specially made for my kid. the fit was perfect. i usually wear a 10 in pants, and i ordered a medium. it seems a bit loose on the hips. perhaps its just the fabric though. they stay on just fine, but just feel loose. i ordered another pair in small because they are so comfortable. beautiful good fit. comfortable easy to move around. very flexible material. i got these for my sister because her son joined the usmc. this is the 5th set i have gotten. they arrived quickly and wear great. i will recommend anyone to buy these sweatpants. great! i am of average height & always worry about the length being too short when i order yoga pants.  these fit perfectly (size small as recommended by other reviewers) and were soft and comfortable.  i would not hesitate to order other pairs in different colors. my family makes fun of them but i love them comfy and cute but they do stand out but hey it ok to be different somtimes i usually buy the more expensive yoga leggings from victorias secret but these are comparable and so much cheaper! they are so soft and comfy and i love them! i give it 4 stars because the fabric is very thin got these for my son\\'s school pants, they have great adjustible band inside for width, great quality marterial not to stiff, but not to cheap either. they will be great for running around on the play ground and for looking nice with his uniform. i\\'m usually not much on cuffed slacks, but these are different.  the sizing is true, except for the length as they run a little long for regular shoes.  with cowboy boots though, these look and feel great.  good quality fabric and stitching. love them they fit great and are very comfortable. sexy and fit very well in all the right places. my daughter loves these pants !!!! nice material and great fit . they look exactly like the picture.  so cool.  i like to workout in them because it makes me feel like i\\'m an 80\\'s aerobics girl.  and seriously, who doesn\\'t want to do that?! we love these pants. they fit great, even over bulky cloth diapers. very comfortable for my 3 month daughter. i bought these for my daughter\\'s ice skating lessons. these pants are a little long but well made. i would recommend them. definitely order these pants on the smaller side. i am a 30-30 and i ordered the xss and they fit exactly to my natural waist. since you can\\'t wear a belt on \\'em if you get ones too big they will fall right off. the fabric and seams seem pretty strong too, something i am concerned about since i do dance in them. i might even be able to do gymnastics in them! i\\'ve only wore them out a few times but they seem like they can take a good beating, but we\\'ll see. i found a pair identical to the ones i recently bought while at mt. rainier national park.  i loved them so much i wore them out.  they are super comfy and hold up well to repeated washings.  the elastic finally gave on my old pair so i was very happy to find a new pair on amazon. these work really well!  exactly what i was looking for. alfred dunner is the only pant that fits like i want it to. love these lite weight denim  but the material has a strange chemical smell. washed them but they still smell. hope it goes away. he loved would order again great fit, fast shipping, perfect gift for my psycho daughter! my favorite pair. it did not look cheaply hemmed, it was very good quality<br />comfortable to wear to events or even casualy,<br />i will be a returning customer. wow i would say i love my leggins , only that i already have a big but , and these leggins make my butt even bigger, quick delivery mind you these are coming from china , great service ! these pants are very authentic for a pirate costume. they seem to run a little on the small size in the crotch. my wife is using the x-large even though they are a little big but look good. i ordered the xx-large and they fit great. i\\'m 5\\'8\\'\\' /  160 # and fit nicely with size and length. i can see how it may be a bit long for petite sizes, warm and snuggly and does not shrink if dried on low. love these pants.  i ordered a medium as others say they run small.  glad i did.  i am 5\\'2&#34; 130 lbs and they fit great.  i was easily able to trim the bottom to fit in length.  i am ready to order another pair - really comfortable and look great!  i<br /><br />**update:  i have worn these a few times and always get compliments - i love them! comfy! bought small size as gift for 14 yr old girl who is probably 5\\'5 and a half, small waisted.  very soft.  length is normal-long.  waist is low, adjustable. no pockets. soft and comfy cheaper than any store and much better quality than any brand. sizes are exactly match the universal sizes. i am working for 11 years and i tried almost all brands, and this is the best. even as you unpack these plaid jeggings you feel the lovely material.  the green plaid itself is also in very good taste, not too loud. when you hold it up, of course you realize that even with the spandex women into the material, it is unlikely that any person over a size 10 will fit into the &#34;large&#34; size jeggings. i love the fabric and the colors. excellent they look nice and are very comfortable, but don\\'t be deceived by the picture: the fabric appears shiny and silky, but it is actually just plain cotton-like. if you like being in a confortable pant, good styling & cheap, take this it\\'s the best you can buy !! i like them. they are perfect for wearing under skirts and dresses, which is what i purchased them for. they came the day after i ordered them which was very exciting. marvelous  . they fit as advertised.  perfect work out pants. plenty of room for exercising.  very comfortable.  very pleasing to the eye. the material is soft snd radiant. thx a bunch i bought this belt about a year ago. i just forgot to write a review. it still in like new condition and i wear it on a weekly basis. very we\\'ll made and worth the price. these are my very favorite footie pj\\'s. they are soft, breathable, and fit very well.  i like the little bit of elastic they put in behind the heel.  they are good quality.  i\\'ve had one for each size my little girl has gone through so far.  i would buy more than one except they are so expensive. first i bought the chocolate brown forest. size large fit great on my 5\\' 8&#34; 135 lbs. definitely long enough. not to tight around the hips and thighs. but be warned, stretch pants are stretch pants. you\\'re always going to get that &#34;leggings look&#34; unless (like the model) you fold the waist waaaayyy down and keep one hip cocked out to the side. the reason i like these is the busy pattern takes attention away from that whole &#34;lower central&#34; area.<br /><br />love them so much i bought the chocolate fresh mint design as well. i like them.  they will work perfectly as replacement buttons for my wwi doughboy uniform and possibly for some other things later.  i checked several fabric stores locally and no one had buttons like these.  add to the fact that wwi uniforms do not come with extra replacement buttons.  this was the answer.  it was great.  thank you for having these button available to me.  richard c. love them will be ordering them again. perfect fit and very comfortable would recommend to my friends and family m so soft, well made. came quicker than expected. great quality and soft. i first ordered the black ones in a size 3x just to make sure they fit...omg!! i\\'m tall and have booty and hips they fit great but i just ordered the grey ones in a 2x so they\\'ll fit even tighter. so if you order these order your size. they are beyond comfortable!!!  definitely will be ordering the pink ones next week and purple. i probably even order the black ones in a 2x...i highly recommend these yoga pants. they\\'re great for tall women!!! also super fast shipping!!!  love vivians love these!  i\\'m short but can pull up the waist!  wore in vegas.  sassy!  good quality. good i actually bought these for a yoga class (not just to wear around the house)....love them!  they are well-constructed and fit great.  they are neither too long nor too short.  i would highly recommend them. love these pants. i have worn this brand for a few years and they hold up well and are very comfortable i wanted a different camo color so i used the same seller as my other camo leggings. they are perfect just like the other ones. so soft and stretchy. you can even wear these camos commando without harming your goodies. cloud was a natural white. that was a relief. there was a little pocket on the back, very cute. never had an experience so liberating! usually, i feel restricted. now, i can be myself.<br /><br />can\\'t wait to try these, my three wolf shirt,  and my squirrel mask simultaneously.<br /><br />i expect i will able to spontaneously hover within 3 weeks. i ordered both the green and blue of these sweaters.  they washed up just as nice if not softer than when they arrived.  would definitely order again. good work pants unique design. comfortable material these are really good quality lounge pants. bought it for my niece who is a huge loki fan and she absolutely loves it. a+++ seller. got these pants earlier than promised. not too tight, not too loose, just right.  i wear these for winter running and biking, and they\\'re good for both but better for the latter.  if you\\'re going to use them for running long distances, cut off the stirrup straps with scissors or they\\'ll irritate your arches.  for biking, the stirrpus keep them from riding up and in the winter coming into a wind or something, that can be a lifesaver.  these took ten days to get to me in the usa, i think they may have shipped from the uk.  but great running pants. excellent purchase! i love it and fits perfectly! best blanket for a newborn! kickeepants products are the best and this blanket does not disappoint! so soft and beautiful! i love love, love these pants quick service when ordering through this company. my dad has loved this brand for a long time so it was great to find these and bring it back!! good pant, new material is not as comfortable as old material. cool pants nice fabric i bought a small because i am in the process  losing weight & the small  fits me just fine! the material is stretchy so... highly recommended. i order these leather pants and they came in the mail today.  ordered them on monday and received them today via the usps.  i was a little worried when my ups tracking did not update.  i had to check the order number and found out the pants were transferred to the post office from ups.  the pants are a little tight but once i stretch them out, they will be just fine.  i wore them out to the mall tonight to do some holiday shopping.  the pants did not make me feel hot.  they actually were able to break in better with the walking i did.  once i lose about 10 pounds, they should fit a little bit better.  love these pants!!. husband is a big duke fan.he loves to wear the pants. fit him so good i had to get myself a pair. they fit well these are so comfortable to wear and they look just like the real thing. actually look better than jeans because i have a small frame and they accentuate my figure these pants are great, they take a lot of abuse, and stand up to many washings and still look great.  placement of all of the pockets is just right.  would recommend. not as form fitting as i thought it would be but all in all very comfortable. i would totally recommend it these are adorable and hold up really well to wear and tear. excellent quality. this is a great purchase. i strongly suggest any one to buy this. well worth the money for this product. bought these in a rush before going snowboarding and was amazed by their quality. i had  to tie the drawstring like many others mentioned but once done the pants fit perfectly. i spent 7 hours on the slopes and at one point dug myself out of 3 feet of snow, yet my legs stayed dry.<br /><br />not very stylish but i would definitely recommend these. it was perfect  for my baby.. she is 5.8 kg and the size was like i expected i really like these pants. they are a little thin but feel really good on. i am 5\\' 7&#34; and 135 and the medium fits really good. these pants are comfortable for yoga, lounging around the house or light jogging- they are not comfortable to sleep in. worth the money, and the material is good. it\\'s worth getting. my daughter loved them. fit perfectly. very comfortable and warm. same as the other reviewer. these are just as good as pants 3 times the price. comfortable, flexible - i\\'m recommending them to all my golf buddies. you can\\'t beat the price.the closest in price are the champion golf pants that target sells... fit find. but the material was not what i wanted. but overall  pretty pant. i like these skinny pants.  the material is pretty light, but the fit well and are great for wearing with boots. a light, fun book.  i usually read more weighty books.  this is just a light fun book which inspired me to explore more or marseille. cute design. center lace can sometimes stretch (or fold) at awkward angles and not look as pretty as expected. we bought these as a gift for my grandaughter and says she cant wait to wear them. she was very happy to get them. i got the leggings fairly quick, and they fit perfectly. they smelled slightly like latex but not major. although i like the leggings, i kind of expected them to look shinier than they actually were. but i don\\'t regret buying them and they have been my favorite pair of black leggings. i love the pants.  they are so comfortable, stylish and different.  i plan to buy more me and my friends. very long and dressy.  great with a nice pair of boots and black shirt. makes a great picture outfit. very soft, comfortable. liked them so much i bought a second pair. love them!!  they fit great! not too heavy.<br />love the colors!  very comfortable , i bought two pairs!!! love em!! item as advertised. recommend to others. love them.  stretchy love the way they fit. fit perfect and nice and soft! i love these pants. please make them available again. i love these for work. i planned on buying more but they are now not available to buy. most comfortable pants ever! definitely reordering. fast delievery, great price, good quality. this girl is happy with the service and product. very cute ! perfect colors. received the item in super fast time, very good quality, came with a matching color belt (nice touch), belt isnt as thick and stiff as my spec ops bdu belt. also; the color for the gray ones you see pictured on some sites, might actually be darker than what you get, ordered gray the label stated light gray. didnt mind though as the light gray still looked good, sort of like foliage green you see when you order 550. material & stitching seem to be excellent quality, and the elastic sides are good as they tend to run slightly smaller along the inseam and waist than the fit of my tech spec 24-7\\'s. the fit is just right.  i ordered the khaki and they were a little darker than expected. ordered 2 pair, they only had one and called me to see if i would like a different color in replacement, got the sand which is more of the color i had expected for khaki. fit true to size and perfect for work! nice, but for taller and thinner people than myself.... i am a size, and these were too tight, they didn\\'t fit properly for me. so i\\'d say one size fits all would work for a body build that looks more like the model, taller and slimmer than me! otherwise, i wish i could have kept them,as they are super cute,and seemed nicely made it is nice soft fabric and well constructed.  there\\'s a hatch in back of the diaper, as well as buttons up the front.  the only downside seems to be it is very thin fabric so you can pretty much see through it depending on lighting or if it is stretched around the diaper. great fit! i like how there is no piling. i have washed these pants several times and they have not shrunk! baby girl attire 101 for mothers who were former tomboys:<br />  many dresses do not come with bloomers/diaper covers.<br /><br />these bloomers are very soft and have a cute ruffle in the back. would highly recommend for potty training.<br />true to size<br />absorbs lots of liquid but child can still tell that they are wet.<br />these have been a life savor okay arrived on time and they\\'re just as i expected sexy!!! my honey looks soo hotttt in these, will be buying the whole lot!!!! love the way it hugs her butt, and with heels...look out! i like to be comfortable and also much better than i thought i would like to buy more. these are great yoga pants, i ordered a medium even though i usually wear a small and after washing i am so glad i did, they fit good as a medium. soft and nice. i recommend. girl loves it i bought these pants for working out at the gym.  they are very light weight, cool and comfortable.  it\\'s made of high quality and durable material.  i love them.  they look great and although they are casual gym wear, they look as classy as dress pants. i carie all my weight in my legs. when i bought the neoprene pants and started working out on my treadmill 30+ mins everyday. i was sweating more the usal, i saw less cellulite on my legs!!!! love it! buy it!!! its awsome and it works!!!!! the pants fit perfect, but after washing, they turned kind of fuzzy instead of staying smooth! i love these pants!  i get so many compliments on them and it\\'s so easy to dress up or dress down.  the better route is to dress them up because they\\'re too pretty to dress down.  the most &#34;down&#34; i would dress these pants are with a plain crop or tank top with flats/sandals.  but, it looks better with wedge heels or heel sandals.  too cute! this pajama set is great, i like the thermal texture and the colors too.  it is nice and soft and the price is not bad at all. these arrived quickly and were just what i was looking for. inexpensive but super cute jeggings to wear to a santa party! they don\\'t call me jlo for nothing and these jeans let everyone know why!!! the fit is perfect! i have had problems with butt lifting jeans sliding down...i feel like i have to keep pulling them up in the back and that\\'s not the case with these, they stay in place. i like the thickness of the material also. jeans have gotten thinner and thinner and give you a stuff sausage look if you have any meat on your bones! these hold you in and give you a smooth look with no bulges. bravo! thin and gauzy.  just at the edge of risqu√©.  the fit is fine (i\\'m 5-10 and 140).  now if only i had the body to wear these shamelessly in public! great product and it really works buy buy buy sizing was great got a large and wear a 36 ....has the string so keep that in mind, will be buying more for sure good job! these skinny twill leggings are flatterig and very comfortable. the fit is good and as expected, the waist isn\\'t super tight but the pants don\\'t fall off or anything. they still conform to your butt and thighs nicely. i\\'ve been looking for this kind of green for awhile now. it\\'s not really a dark green or a true kelly green but it has a muted and yet vibrant green color. almost like a pastel hue but darker. these pants feel like yoga pants, but look professional. they aren\\'t lined, so they\\'re a little chilly in the winter, but they\\'re so comfortable. i\\'m considering buying multiple pairs. i like everything about these sweats from the color to usmc letters running down the left side. the only thing i dont like is that there are no pockets. other then that i definently would recomend them the sizing is right on. they look great and feel soft, comfortable. wash well. would buy more in different colors. these pants are wonderful! they are expensive but worth every penny. i am currently 25 weeks pregnant and have been wearing them to work since i was 18 weeks. i really like the secret belly fit. i have 2 pairs of these pants, 1 pair in black and 1 in grey. they run true to size but i recommend trying them on in a store before purchase. enjoy! liked the pattern i use them as workout capri in gym. i bought 2 more this week ( they are finally back in stock), because i won\\'t wear any other bottoms but these. i think the skirt is right length and cute. i wash them at least 4 times a week in hot water too and they still look brand new and fit like new. go fila! there a bit big but i washed them and i didnt want to dry them until my husband tried them on and so now i will sash them and dry them in the dryer so they will fit him perfect,,,,he did say how much he liked them. once again allegra does not disappoint super happy with all my purchases with allergra, no issues with fabric or quality with item. plus fit wonderfully. i have hips and thighs fabric  covered and contoured my body wonderfully. if ur a smaller frame i\\'d assume the same due to righteous quality of allergra products!! these are an inexpensive pair of lounge/yoga pants. i\\'m 5\\'3 - got the medium based on the 8/10 sizing and they fit everywhere fine but frankly are too long. i read another review about long length so i almost didn\\'t get them.  so if you\\'re on the shorter side, and do not want ones that hang past the heel of your shoe, i\\'d get a different brand.  if they were tried on in a store, i wouldn\\'t have bought them, but i\\'m not going to be returning them. they are fine to wear around the house where and workout.  they\\'d definitely get caught on the heels of my shoes wearing outside and being that it rains here a lot, won\\'t be a part of any outside attire.  if not for the length, i\\'d order a few more pairs of them because they are comfortable.  i cannot report on their durability or long term quality, but i didn\\'t spend the type of money on them to expect any outlandishly great results in those departments. i like them have 6 pairs of them, always fit great! some of the pockets are deeper than others, durable and look great! great quality üëèüëèüëè fit small we have been using cloth diapers for our youngest child, and we\\'re moving into potty training as summer approaches.  we bought these because they\\'re much cheaper than the imse vimse and bummis that we found at the cloth diaper retailers. while i can\\'t directly compare, i can say that i am very happy with the gerber training pants.  be sure to wash them before use - they\\'re almost slippery when new and absorb nothing.  after a single washing, they were a lot softer and held a good amount of *ahem* fluid.  the downside is that because they are snug, if your kiddo poops, when you pull them down, you can drag poop down his or her legs.  the good thing about them being snug is that the poop doesn\\'t just fall out into their car seat, stroller, or pants!  the legs are pretty trim.  we have a semi-chunky toddler and they\\'re snug, but soft enough not to bother her or cut into her legs like some of the plastic pants we\\'ve seen.  overall, i am very happy with these!  i am giving 4 out of 5 stars for the mess factor.  i am going to cut down the sides, serge the seams and add snaps to the sides so i can unsnap them when there are messes to be cleaned! i love these pants.  i\\'m going to buy more. oh my goodness this is my favorite piece in my entire wardrobe and trust me i have a enormous wardrobe so thankful i made this purchase these go with anything you can dress them up you can dress them down beach cover-up elegant dinner party & so on and so forth. perfect fit,could be longer tho great i am in hot area-these taper narrow down leg  they sit either on hip or pull them above belly.  if your size 8-9 medium is good,but size 10-12 large  depending on your waistline. i am slim 5 7 tall .they would be  short on 5.9 size .  the color when hand washed for t3 turned white/blackish slight green  pattern. dark pattern,very beachy. not light like pictured. a little too long and i have long legs perfect! for those who find it hard to find leggings and yoga pants which are long enough - look no further!<br />these are well made and comfortable.  the fit is great.  i now have 3 pair!  they are terrific. they are a perfect fit and perfect for any occasion. so warm in the winter months, super comfy and a great flex fit! nice product, fits well, stash pocket comes in handy awsome snow pants, they are great for lower temperature keeping you warm, i own others pants more expencive than this ones and let me tell you something for the price these pants are worth it, they are water proff, and had some  flece fabric on the inside the insulation in these pants are extremely good, you can put this on for extreme weather, if not you will be sweating like hell that\\'s ow warm they are, one thing that i didn\\'t like tho, they are supper baggy, i got them medium and they are big on me, am 5.10&#34; and they seams bigger, so if you are planning on buying these pants think about how big they would look on you.<br /><br />overall, they are great for the low cost, will keep you warm and protected from any weather, weather proff,<br />cargo base pockets, and nice flece interior, cons, they are bigger than you expect, no way on knowing witch size you should buy for your height, highly recomended. these are cute love!!! ordered one size bigger since they\\'re juniors and they fit perfect! material seems strong, like it will probably last awhile, and they\\'re too cute. i will certainly be buying more in other colors. i got the black and coral ones, and cannot wait to buy more. worth the money. these are my new favorite work pants! i love how to fit, and my hubby loves how they make my ass look, haha.  love them!!! i bought them large so he can grow into them i am a size 14 with curves. they fit perfect. the waist band is adjustable and lay were you adjust it. the material gives you the support and tone look. great price, great deal, great buy. i would buy again and again !!! not see through , so great for outdoor it is a little see through. but otherwise fits and feels great i love these pants! i have 8 pair and wear them everyday to work. they\\'re durable, comfortable, amd stylish. however, the pair with the white waisteband run small in the pant legs. i roll them up and wear them as caprice i got these earlier than expected! i honestly didn\\'t expect to like them this much. i figured they would be awkward fitting or a weird color but i loved them before i even tried them on! i wear 13 usually, but went with an 11, and they fit like a glove which is unusual because i have very thick thighs. i may order more in a 9 just because i like tight jeans! the color is exactly what i wanted. i am super impressed considering the price! üòäüòä now, i have not washed these yet, so i can\\'t attest to how well they hold up to that. these are great. the fabric is so soft and comfy. other reviewers are right in saying that these are unlike most yoga pants, but i feel it\\'s a good thing. they don\\'t cling to your body as much as the really stretchy &#34;lycra-y&#34; ones do. they are also a good length for me, i find most pants (especially lounge/pajama) to be too short for me. i am 5\\'6, size 0-3 (115-120lbs). bought the small. they were a bit snug at first, but within a little while of wear they fit perfect.  :) tight unless you are a size 0 i wear these all the time!  fits perfect and very comfortable.  just what i was looking for.  the grey hides tummy bulge! i love these.  i wear them under my work-out clothes to keep me warm.  very comfy.  i also wore them under a dress like tights.  very nice.  fyi after they\\'re washed a time or two they\\'ll get &#34;pills&#34;, so you might want to hand wash them instead. i am 5\\'3&#34; tall and have a petite, athletic body.  i bought the small and they fit me perfectly.  i need to wear a pair of heels or wedges, but i always do anyways.  i didn\\'t have to have them hemmed at all.  they feel unbelievably soft and comfortable.  i like the patterns that run down the pants because they make my legs look slim and long.  i am looking for more of these in different colors. good product!!!! i am 5\\'7 and aboit 170 lbs and i have ratherly large thighs. i ordered an x-large and i still worried that they would fit me, but they did! the only thing wrong is that they are a bit longer than my legs and a bit thick for my liking but other than that, these joggers are great excellent service, great fitting yoga pants. they look great and the material gives stretch for any movement. the length is perfect for me, too. really liked them my husband loves them. perfect christmas gift! his new pj\\'s. loves legs covered at night i really like those pants! they came much earlier than expected, plus i got 2 pairs of kids socks and some stickers as a present. my kids love them! they are light and cotton, perfect for summer. very stylish! good quality material and craft - clean seams. material is a little thicker than other pants in baby\\'s wardrobe, which is great for cooler weather and for the cold temperatures at day care. they keep him warm while he plays. i absolutely love this jumpsuit and when i wear it i get tons of compliments. i\\'ll buy more, for sure. my daughter loves these n the price is very affordable high quality as expected. most columbia in a 4 has been the perfect fit. this 4/5 was slightly smaller than i expected. he was able to still wear them all winter with layers underneath. i just expected a little more wiggle room. but they got us through the season and will passed on! these are fun pajamas, comfortable fit through waist and butt, with loose fit in the legs!  they are silly looking, making you smile at bedtime, what could be better for getting a good night sleep!  i loved them so much when my friend brought me a pair for my birthday and brought them back from a trip to gatlingberg, that i went on line to purchase this pair. it was a little long, but i was able to adjust it with my sewing machine.  love it i bought these to wear to hip hop class. the work perfectly. they are light-weight so i don\\'t get too hot. the one downside is that the bottom is purely cotton fabric (no elastic) so i have a feeling if i hike them up to turn them into capris, i will stretch out the fabric). outfit came early in the mail! fit was right, great color- just like the picture, great price! great buy! i\\'m 7 months pregnant and they still fit very comfortably! i purchased for my daughter and she loves it. very cute and comfortable. a little long but so comfortable i had never heard of thalian clothing until about 6 months ago.  i bought my first pair of pants at a brand name store on sale.  i absolutely loved them.  they were completely comfortable and the length was long and slimming.  but i could never find another pair of thalian cuffed pants again until i found them online at amazon.com.  my new pair of pants are exactly what i had been looking for - quadra-stretch fabric for a more comfortable, moveable, slimming fit, and tailored to look more expensive than it really is.  for a woman with a slim waist, but fuller hips, that needs pants that are able to take you from work to play effortlessly, these pants are it.  thalian rocks! these were nice and stretchy and fit well.  the material was nice and soft.  more comfortable than expected! perfect fit! these tights are great! they\\'re sexy and fit comfortably. i get complements every time i wear them. money well spent! my son had pajama day and he wanted the flash - i came to amazon and found the exact item.  orderd it, it arrived promptly and my son was amazed.  he loved it.  they fit perfect (yes, i came back and got the matching top).  he was a big hit.  thanks amazon for having the specialty items we needed for a holiday, these pants are perfect. they definitely don\\'t hide much, so consider wearing shorts or a skirt over them! a long sweatshirt isn\\'t enough. so comfy and super stylish. i got so many compliments i bought this to go under skirts more for modesty than anything else, and i am glad i did rome may not be the haven for pickpockets it once was, but the problem of what to do with your cash and spare credit cards is still an issue when you travel. i\\'ve never liked the things that hang from your neck or the money belts and i thought this product was perfect.<br /><br />it hangs very comfortably from your belt. in fact, once on this trip i had a panic when i thought the wallet was missing -- and it was right there where it belonged. it meets the two criteria i have for such a product -- it\\'s comfortable to wear and seems very secure. i purchased this in blue, green, and white. i actually ended up liking the \\\\\\\\\"green\\\\\\\\\" color the best even though i tend to favor blue. it\\'s not really green, it\\'s more in between blue and green. you can see the pattern of his onesie underneath these, but it\\'s still so cute. his butt looks like a baseball because of the stitching. it is very soft and comfortable for my eczema prone baby. the size is now just perfect as he is approaching nine months, and i am sad that he will be outgrowing these as baby bambu does not make these any larger. these are a bit snug,but soo soft and comfy:) i love them. my bf said they are hands down my best purchase. very flattering. pants fit great and are as retina burning as i had hoped. i wanted something striking and have been drooling over these pants for 6months +  and i finally broke down and got them. best decision ever!<br /><br />i somehow accidentally ordered two pants and there was absolutely no hassle with returning the second pair. my money was returned promptly and they answered all my questions. so, not only are the pants amazing, but the company that sold them is too! love it!!!!!!!!!!  thanks i got this pants for my niece and they fit perfect, she is a thin tall girl and it was a great feature that legs are long so they can be hemmed at any length.<br /><br />if you have a thin tall kid this is the way to go. the colours are amazing. the pants can be mixed with lots of different tops. love them. will likely order more in bigger sizes. these slacks are cut just right for my size.  will buy more haggar products. so, i go to the renaissance festival up here in minnesota every year, multiple times a year. these pants not only fit great, but they are made of excellent material and something that i\\'m more than willing to wear off to these special events. you won\\'t be disappointed. i love these scrub pants. just got them yesterday. will wear them monday. i\\'m guessing they\\'ll not shrink much. they look clean, pressed and ready to wear. and so inexpensive. perfect. shows up plenty of my figure simple very sexy although it\\'s listed at 29 in, it is 31,5 long. i will have to shorten them. otherwise they fit well and look good. my boyfriend bought these for me for christmas.  they are made of thick material and fit amazingly. i absolutely love these pants. they are extremely comfortable. the 100% cotton is comfortably light. a great pant for lounging around the house. i am not planning to wear the pants as a romper, so i won\\'t speak to that. overall satisfied :) a little pricy but they fit perfect just like i like them would definitely buy more nice scrubs!  cute colors great selection, great fit! nice wife on this account.<br /><br />i am 5 feet tall and usually wear a size 16/18 or xl.  i purchased these pants as an xl short.<br />everything about these pants are perfect.  they are soft, flexible, rest perfectly on my curves, and retain their shape all-day long.<br />quite possibly the most comfortable pants (that i can wear out in public) i have worn in a long time. i love them but that can just be me, so i would start by what i think people might dislike. they are very big so a 6-9 is really more like a 12. also, once you wash them they become kind of saggy and the fitted part in the ankle looses its fit. however, i love them because they are nice, they do not fade, they match everything, since they are so big my baby can use them for a long time. also, they are very light (not bulky). i love that they are one plain color, no bows, hearts, princess stuff, and so forth. you can combine them with many things. i also liked the price.<br />what i do so my baby does not trip because they are long is to fold them and use them kind of like capris. they look really cute! like she was ready to go to the beach. shipment was faster than expected. the leggings are just as pictured. very nice color. i am 5ft and the fit is good. i ordered this for my new granddaughter, as her dad\\'s a hunter.  beyond being really cute, this is a nice jogging suit.  fabric is a nice weight and the inside is brushed and very soft, and the zipper is plastic vs metal which can scratch.  washed nicely with no-minimal shrinkage.  i\\'m sure this will be a favorite outfit once the weather gets cool. i am 5 2 and 120 lbs i got the medium size and these fit good. they are a little to long but the quality and color are awesome. i recommend!!  update: i bought two other colors but when i bought these they were shorter? not complaining, because they are the perfect length. just a little confused as to why the length is different. still love them! i love this set! the colors are as vibrant as pictured, the top & bottom fit well, and the fabric is good, too. definitely recommend! i\\'m 5\\'9&#34; 140lbs and i have long legs so it\\'s sometimes an issue finding sweatpants that are long enough. i ordered a small and they are perfectly long enough! super comfy too! my first pair of skinny pants and it\\'s opened the world of skinny jeans. feels comfortable, pretty easy to move in and they make my lower body look incredible. i love these pants! i\\'m 5\\'10\\'\\' and have a 36&#34; inseam and these fit great! they are long enough for my long legs. the waist on the other hang is a little tight. i ordered a size bigger when i ordered my second pair and they fit nicer. got sooooo mnay compliments on thus. thought it would be really hot amd mot breathable material but it was really quite comfortable close but did the job looks better than expected two packs of two potty training pants arrive, today. these are form out of country and took a little while to arrive with free shipping, the set ar of nice quality cotton. thick in the bottom area for accident absorption.  the design for boys is perfect and simple.<br />i received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. my brother loves these.  bought as a christmas present.  great quality. comfortable. pants are comfy for my daughter.  love the product. i really like these harem pants. they\\'re simple and absurdly comfortable for hanging out at home. i only wish they also came in tall sizes. tall people need cute pants too, y\\'all. product seems high quality.  i used the size chart though and while it said i needed an xl, the xl came in and was way too big for me.  size chart needs to be revised, but product looks pretty good. love, love, love these pants! being a big gal i was concerned about whether the pants would cling to snug and be unflattering. i love the fit, they are tastefully fitted for the bigger gal. fitted but not snug, flattering in the right places. i love them so much i am contemplating buying more pairs. and most of all they are very comfortable! very comfortable! got these for part of my rockford peach baseball costume, they went with it perfectly:) fits great and very comfy i love kickee pants pj\\'s.  although i cannot justify spending this much on my own pajama\\'s, these are so soft that we have had them in almost every size.  they are a great light-weight material that works great in the fluctuating heat of southern california. i bought this item, and the good news is that these pink slacks are cute as can be and fit curves/thicker thighs well. i have a tiny waist and big hips / thighs and these cute pink slacks fit and look very cute on. the only reason why i gave it a 4 star review instead of 5 is because they have to be dry cleaned and i hate dry cleaning. i\\'m 5\\'8\\\\\\\\\" and they also fit pretty decently on the length. i am a size 10/12 and these fit nicely. very cute for casual beach wear. these are awesome. freaking love em\\'.<br /><br />i\\'m never taking these off. these are perfect go-to pants for running around, doing photography, visiting friends...and can be dressed up or down even for casual days at work with a nice top.<br /><br />some reviewers said the material is see-through, so i was a little nervous, but i have dark skin, and there was absolutely no show-through, and it even does pretty well with masking thin panty lines. i am 5\\' 8&#34; and 128lbs, and got the small (my usual size is sm/4) which fit perfectly, form-fitting without being indecently tight. got compliments in \\'em too. they were bigger than i thought they would be . i bought this set for my new granddaughter and they were perfect. how can you go wrong with all you get for the price and the set is so cute. i totally recommend this. i wear these everywhere. i am 120 and 5\\'7 and the small fits nice and snug without exaggerated tightness. i find the material of good quality although one pant ripped a bit on the side while i was trying it on. no big deal, i just stitched it up. i have purchased at least eight of these and that was the only one that ripped, and i have washed them many times. the pants are comfortable and stretchy. also, the length is perfect for my height. so overall i think the quality is quite good for the price and the fit is as expected. good price and material. they are soft and comfy. my kiddo wears them as pajamas pants (trying to put socks on an infant is a joke). i wish they came in more colors so i could buy them all. the hot pink is great and so is the navy blue. perfect i love these yoga pants. in reading reviews, it was mixed review in terms of size so i bought a small and medium. i had to return the medium as it was big for me. this fits true to size and i am 5\\'3&#34; and 125 lbs. only thing is that i don\\'t like \\'2015\\' on it but i can live with it. my top covers it. we can barely get our son to take them off since he got them for christmas.  happy son, so happy parents.  love \\'em! very nice uniforms great product i love these legging. they are thick and soft and fit well. but i would not recommend for anyone very tall. i am 5\\'5 and they are just the right length. thinking of buying two more pair ,i like them too much. i purchased 3 pairs of these.  they are very similar to the american apparel brand that i also had, which sell for about $35 a piece, but are made in the usa.  i agree they are thin, but they are comfortable. you might want to go a size up with this pants. they worked great for my husband, but he is a small fit, so they were just right for him. love them this is actually the second one of these that we have purchased. we loved the first one so much that when she grew out of it, we had to get the next size up. it is simply the softest piece of clothing we own and our daughter loves it. it isn\\'t very thick, so don\\'t get it for warmth, but it looks fantastic!<br /><br />it is still a little big on her and she is 10 months now, but she is a small baby. i would guess that the fit would be right on for an average size baby. love the kickee rompers. they really are perfect for evening and play time. soft, stretchy and lots of fun choices for boys. we stocked up on them and use them in summer time as they are perfect to go under light sleep sack on hot summer days or all by themselves. beatifull we had looked everywhere for these wonderful training pants.  i used them for my girls over 50 years ago and now my great granddaughter is wearing the same brand.  these are ideal for teaching a little girl how to go on her own. these are very lightweight pants. they are good for summer.  they probably won\\'t last too long because of the thin fabric. i bought this for a costume and the seam was seamless and the shorts fit just right. they were very comfortable love them. i\\'ve noticed the difference in these vs regular work out pants you do sweat more. i\\'m glad i bought a size down. they fit great perfect for under my summer long dresses. love the pants but they are around 2 inches too short in inseam. otherwise they function as described! wonderfully soft, easy to wear and they look good.  my favorite go to work out pants and frankly lounge around the house pants.  fit well, wash well and seem to be holding up really well after several washings.  love these pants. these were phenomenal at our wedding! i bought these for my husband to use (i\\'m on his account :d ) and he looked great! only thing i would warn is that there\\'s not a whole lot of wiggle room for kneeling or squatting. some of the photos our photographer wanted to take had him in those positions and he said there was no stretch in the fabric, so he felt them tearing a little. you can see him in a photo someone took of us at the wedding. he\\'s, of course, the one next to the bride. i like the color but i was surprise of the material be it a tice jean but it have a great look and would recommend this item to all my friends. i finally found pants that are long enough.  i\\'m 5\\'8 and need a 33&#34; inseam and these are perfect.  i am a plump size 14 and the xlg  fit just fine.  however, i think that if you are between a 12 and 14 the xlg would be a perfect fit.  these fit my chubby figure snugly and i guess that\\'s what most people are after these days but i prefer a little space between the cellulite and the slack.  not the pants fault though :)  they wash like a dream and the only slight drawback is that they do pick up hair/lint easily.  i own 3 cats so i have to be careful not to sit in the kitty zone but other than that these are excellent pants and the fact that they come in taller sizes is wonderful.  the other big plus is that they do not stretch out and get baggy. these pants look great. a little shorter in in length than i wish for a slim 5\\'7&#34; young lady. really comfy cute and comfy great pants. love them. super comfy honesty most comfy lounge about pants i have ever had. they are also perfect for pregnancy!! love love love them. love them, smell weird but other than that very nice and good price fits perfect i bought these for my aunt for christmas. the fabric was cozy and comfy. the pattern was adorable and cute. she put them on and they fit perfectly. she is about 5\\'6 and they were long which is good. long is better than short any day! i was hoping to find the training pants i used for my kids for my grandchild, and these are perfect. just received two pairs today. very nice-fit my grandchild well. nice that they come in bigger toddler sizes as the older toddler dresses no longer come with diaper covers and having a plastic diaper under a really pretty dress is less than desirable. shipping was quick. my only complaint is i see the price has risen a $1.00 a pair since i ordered. i also think the shipping and handling charges were a little steep for such small, light objects.i wanted to order more pairs but who knows if price will increase again before i order---so far i am very happy with purchase and will see how they wash up before i order more. they\\'re very odd... but i think they look great on me. nice, the color was somewhat different, but that\\'s to be expected. good pants and i will enjoy them.good deal for anyone. i love all of the reviews on this product! these pants fit wonderfully! i purchased them for my 6\\' 2&#34; boyfriend and they were just the right length. they are fun and funny and were perfect for our patriotic costumes! loved these pants, perfect slim fit that complements a nice figure. perfect fit love them! love it, i need more colors<br />they fit great, and look great, for the full sized woman you can\\'t go wrong my wife loves them.... use\\'s them as pajama\\'s it is always chancy ordering online. i have been looking for pants like these for months. everthing i tried were too tight, too flimsy, more like tights than pants.<br />i bought two pair and am so happy with my purchase, not to mention that they fit perfectly. i can wear them to work, out with friends, too bad i don\\'t do yoga. fits perfectly, im.5&#34;4 and 108 pounds<br />sooo cute love these!  they are way cute and so comfortable.  im getting more! our agency bought several of these and are very happy - for the cost you can not find a better value. proper and ripstop are the best and this item is no exception. the seller is also very helpful and communicates quickly! i won best costume award at the halloween party i attended.  everyone loved how legit the costume looked!  definitely a must have for any hulksters out there. they were as advertised i like dunner petites a lot. they are one of just a couple of brands that fit me without having to be shortened. that saves me time and money! i love them!!!  great purchase. a hair large, but they are fine. ok, you cannot beat the softness and comfort factor of these kicky pants shirts. when my baby wears them, i want to snuggle her even more than usual. and if i could dress her in these every day, i would. i already have 4 for her as it is. but it comes at a price! literally! they are so dang expensive... and hard to keep looking new! these products simply cannot handle normal washing. i have finally learned (maybe too late) that you pretty much have to wash these by hand with soap (not detergent) and lay them flat to dry, which is of course very inconvenient when you\\'re talking about baby clothes which are constantly being washed. after two times through the dryer the shirt had tiny holes. but even despite this i still find myself wanting to buy the kid more of these shirts because of how soft they are! it\\'s ridiculous! hehe, so don\\'t buy these unless you are willing to take extra special care of them.<br />also i wish they were made in the usa. they look exactly like the picture and fit well are good quality and very stretchy! i do hope they last for a while! i wish i could get a bigger size so that they don\\'t wear out. item is as described and look exactly like the photo. i was very pleased. they are stylish and comfortable. love love love these pants i got a booty on me so these make it look even better!! want to buy more like these hit of the halloween parties, and extremely comfortable - tempted to wear to work. so cute and soft! have used them for years, mostly for rock climbing and trekking. great product in all ways. now use them for running on colder days and they\\'re great. good cotton so reliable for quality<br />it\\'s cute especially about top of the hat.<br />easy to put it on and take it off as well. great the fabric has gotten a little thinner over the years but i still like the style. these are high quality well made pants for dress or casual wear. i love them. they fit perfectly and are not cut for junoirs. happy with my purchase. then this is a reasonable choice for you.  the stretcher is easy to figure out, if you can spend ten minutes to read the slightly unclear instructions and play with the tool itself.  then, still watching the instructions, insert tool into waistband.  the plastic toolparts are very sturdy, notwithstanding the hollow tube will crank fine within limits, but for my husband\\'s jeans that turns out to be about 2-2 1/2, 3&#34; at the most  without the tube bowing unnecessarily.  i consider that this stretcher and i will have a long time together.  i was mildly and pleasantly surprised at the inclusion of a lightweight hanger, so no need for an extra hanger!!!  i would suggest this to a friend but with a quick tutorial. i thought the shipping was a little high for plastic.  a couple of small amendments would make this a super product that is already very good. love these! and the length was perfect! i would recommend this item. the price was great, pants were just as advertised, shipping was with-in the period estimated. i\\'m going to order another pair. i love these pants i want to buy a few more. the fit in all the right places and i still have weight to lose. love the material, lightweight. best pants ever. would buy a million pairs and never take them off if it were socially acceptable. get gift for college kids like me. i love the look of these pants....i just ordered three different color schemes of these pants and two have arrived including this pair....both pair fit great and look great...the only reason i am not giving 5 stars is that the material is kind of thin, and i dont know how well they will hold up, but they should hold up for years...probably should give them a 5, but nothing is really perfect is it..?? a very good and versatile pair of sweats. can be used for many a cold day or simply working out. i like the fit and comfort. good bought this for my gf as a gift. very comfortable and the logo looks great. great look like regular jeans. perfect size and very soft and easy to pull on. recommend these jeans to every one. must have comfortable.  you can dress up or down!  make a statement be different! super comfy, just wish they made them in girls\\' sizes! i\\'m writing this just as i ordered a second pair. i\\'m 5\\'7, 145 lbs and pear-shaped. i ordered the size 10. these fit perfectly! they hug the butt without leaving lovehandles, and they\\'re long enough to reach past my ankle ( i have a long inseam). highly recommend! i love these pants! i did noticed the runa tad bit to big. i ordered a xl because i was nervous that they would be too tight. i could have gotten away with a large or maybe ever a medium. these are a decent weight of material. they are not the super thin pants that i normally expect with yoga pants. they were not see through at all and are very comfy. they are also a great length. normally with yoga pants i find that most are just a little too short. these reached the floor on me and even had a little extra length. i already washed them twice and they have held up very well. i will definitely be ordering more. adorable with the shirts i bought. too small for me but looks great on my husband. i like these pants.  they look cute, are very comfortable, and the material is not too thick or thin.  i gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because i only wore them once so far, and i can\\'t really rate how well they hold up yet.  nice pants for the price. they shrunk a little in the dryer length wise but they\\'re still perfect what\\'s more to say, they are great, comfortable and look good, i would buy them again.  only have them a week but no complaints. this uniform was made of a sturdy material, has held up beautifully in the wash, and fits as described. my only complaint is that it is not feminine. i like to still feel a little bit feminine, even in scrubs, which is a challenge. but, this uniform makes that a little more of a challenge. other than that, it is a great uniform at a great price. i\\'m 7\\'4&#34; - these were plenty long for me,i\\'m very happy with the quality so far. thank you so much!! came a day late, but i don\\'t know who\\'s fault that is.  the colors are perfect (red is super bright), and the crotches are a little funny, almost too far back.  i\\'m a 180 lb runner, so i have huge calf muscles and thighs, and this free size just barely fits. good product cute, soft and very functional.  my son is 4 years old but is on the smaller side for his age.  2t would be fitted, 3t is still a little loose. i really like these pants. they were a little baggier in the legs than i thought they would be, but after wearing them around i like that they are not tight all over. the material is soft and breathable. all-in-all they are comfy pants! =) these were a little big on me but i just wear a belt and it\\'s fine i\\'m used to this problem cause i\\'m tiny otherwise love these pants the fabic is so comfy the most comfortable lounge pants ever!! perfect fit and does not shrink in dryer. i would recommend these to everyone i\\'m a size 12 and it fits my booty. i was suprised when it arrived. it almost looked like doll clothing. but i covered all the stuff it was suposed to. i really was skeptical about buying these leggings because \\\\\\\\\"normally\\\\\\\\\" if it seems too good to be true it usually is. these leggings are awesome! they are made out of thicker material. digital print is perfect. tons of compliments today when i wore them to gym. i\\'m a very muscular 5\\'4 chick. they are alittle long ( one size fits all right?!) but you can adjust them around to fit proportionately.  plus even tho they came from overseas they arrived sooner than anticipated.  i would definitely order again!! highly recommend!!! nice quality for price, warm but not too hot when active. long enough for  34 inseam. roomy enough for easy movement i use these for mountain biking, but they would be a great option for a lot of athletic activities. the quality of the product is excellent. and even though the pants were being shipped from great britain to the u.s., delivery was prompt. i plan on ordering another pair soon. my father loved them for easter! he needed them. they were a little long sending them to me though. okay product.. good material...fit good.... it came very fast.  fabric is good.  nice color, as shown in pic.  i would say 5 stars if my baby doesn\\'t need to choose very particular fabric.  she has eczema and it is a little bit warm for her skin even in chicago weather.<br />for normal baby with good skin, i would recommend it. these designers scrubs are attractive and well made. they are used every week.and. they create a cute uniform, attractive and fun .... like it very nice,comfy, good looking pants,i\\'m 5,2, and it fits just perfect, cotton.nicely made,funky,wear it if you 14 y old to 85:) good quality and thick material, a little baggy perhaps but i still like them on my husband. good for outdoor work or hiking etc. i love these they are cute and fit me great and they are comfortable. fit just as i had expected. will order these again. theses pj\\'s are perfect. i love these pants. it feels so comfortable and soft on my 9 month old and not snug at all. would definitely recommend them. love them, fit perfectly and arrived on time. very satisfied this is the must have for a nite out at a bar great customer service, and pants are great to. so comfortable , that i\\'m thinking to get more pairs. was the perfect colour and the size was as expected. i needed this to fall under a costume and was quite nervous of the lines but it worked out great. they are comfortable but feel a little cheap. they are thin but they fit really well. they are great for yoga or lounging. i love these tights! they aren\\'t exactly as described but that\\'s fine! the color of the tights is lighter than the picture, and skulls are facing the opposite way. it doesn\\'t bother me at all though. they fit perfectly, and i\\'d recommend these to everyone, especially because i got a lot of compliments on them! they came early and that was a plus! anyways i\\'d defiantly buy from the seller again! ultra comfy pants...i got a l but it say it was 30 to 32 and i think next time i buy it i will buy a m.  also, the length is bit a long so you can either fold them up but eventually i will get it tailor when i find the time, but other then that it\\'s good pants to have as a chef. the sizing is accurate, the fabric is great and comfortable.  easy wash and great to travel with. oh so cute. they will look great with long boots and a turtleneck and a cute little grey jacket. they are so different, great style and fit and price. get them. i got these for a halloween costume and they are comfortable and a decent material that made it through the wash. honestly i bought them for my sister who is a big goofy fan. they where great though. i don\\'t think she will be wearing them lol. she loved them! weeeell i\\'m a girl, and these are guys pants. i had to bend them a little bit, so my butt looked good in them. but i love the material, and it was exactly what i was looking for. i like it i just need a small not a large i love it....it is so comfortable... will order more colors and it actually fits plus size....wow for the price, these are excellent. the material they are made of is pretty decent. the only real complaint is, while they fit great, but rides a bit low on the waist. this would be ok for jeans but maybe not for night time wear. kalon clothing juniors fold over athletic pants (small, black) fit as i expected. our daughter is size 3-4 she is average height 5\\'4.5&#34;. the pants can be long enough for a 5\\'6&#34; female. the construction and quality of material is excellent for the price. excellent!  i have bought several of these for my great niece and great nephew.  they are so very soft and have held up well.  i wash by hand mostly and hang to dry and they stay looking new.  one thing i love about these too...all kicky pants items...is the stretch.  especially in a newborn, i always have hated to have to pull things over their heads but the stretch in these makes it so easy.  i have also bought the pants and tops (pajamas) and the dress.  all are great.  these are nice for girls too because unlike the pajamas, there is nothing to ride up.  on the pajamas, when you pick up the baby, i am constantly pulling down the top but that doesn\\'t really bother me.  to me these are a bit expensive but are worth the price especially is softness is important to you. love it! love them love them. definite must buy! perfect these fit amazing! i bought a size medium, 5\\'6&#34; 122 lbs. these make my non-existent butt look great, and they hug my calves, which are also pretty non-existent. i\\'m really pleased with this brand. i\\'ve bought yoga pants in this brand, and they\\'re also amazing! nice fit and fabric is great. so glad i found these, it\\'s hard to find pant with feet i use them for pj\\'s i lost a lot of weight and needed pants for work that are clean and crisp looking with an elastic waist. these pants fit the bill exceptionally well i did good on this christmas present for my wife!  she\\'s generally a size 12-ish, but she\\'s very...uh...top heavy...er...voluptuous, so the tops are usually a challenge.  both the bottoms and the top of this fit just fine!  substantial fabric, but not scratchy. these pants are so comfortable and they fit really well too.  i\\'m tall and often have trouble with yoga pants not being long enough.  these are great! husband bought these to walk the dogs in when it rains and absolutely loves them.  and at that price could throw them away if they frayed or fell apart (they haven\\'t, not even a hint).  highly recommend. i get so many compliments on these yoga pants... they look like jeans, where did you get them.. on amazon! i love the snug fit as i wear them while giving thai massage and as i dislike spandex so i am always looking for good cotton pants but the draw back is that they get loose and slip off my hips. not these. they are a great material and zero slipping off and i have had them for at least 4 months, love them fine comfy but thin love the gathered thermal pant legs. really comfortable yet can be dressed up or down. i bought these for halloween and they were a little tight. however, they are cute enough to wear during the winter months and the high waist makes for added comfort. very comfortable, looks just like the photo. fix just right, nice in thick. the pants are great actually comfortable to me, rugged constuction . my only problem with these are button fly so plan ahead the extra time if u know what i mean i realized after having my little one that we didn\\'t have pants with feet!  socks didn\\'t stay on so these pants were/are great!  fit is perfect and i love the babysoy brand, thick cotton clothes.  much better quality imo than carter\\'s, etc. we got the army green - omg; too cute.  the lower cuff on the pants adds a nice touch.  great quality, nice fabric.  would totally order again. bought this shirt for one of my friends, we are the same size so when it arrived i tried it on, it looked like it was too small but it actually fit perfect.  shirt is made well and she absolutely loved it.  she said she kept getting stopped with people telling her how much they loved it and asking where she got it. love love them the product got here early so that\\'s awesome! they look good for the look i\\'m going for! i will update on quality when i know, but they seem pretty strong such soft material and fits great even with my big booty. wish they were longer but that\\'s just cause of my ridiculously long legs. they fit and were just the look we were going for thank you very much guys will use you again next time these pants are a very brilliant color and comfortable too. i was pleased with the timely delivery. peace, love, and rock-and-roll! nice. very comfortable. i\\'m a bit short-waisted, so i didn\\'t have any problems with the pants being cut too low. in fact, i can choose to either wear the fold-over waistline folded way down, moderately folded to cover most of my tummy, or pulled all the way up to my waist. the design allows for versatility. plus, the fabric is soft and breathes, very important when working out. loose fit offers ease of movement without excess fabric getting in the way. good yoga pants for yoga or everyday. love them but a little small. i\\'m keeping the large for my friend and ordered an xl nice very comfortable and they look cool to boot!  nothing better than reading captain america comics on a lazy weekend day while wearing these awesome pants. happy with these products,,, was a big hit, and for professional use as well...<br />:) scott evans, artistic director<br />https://www.facebook.com/scottevansfla<br />954.963.4449 i bought this pair and a less expensive one off amazon. when i got them i repackaged the less expensive item immediately and kept the ililily skirt leggings. the ililily leggings are high quality, thick, stretchy and fit great. i am 5\\'2\\\\\\\\\" with 35 inch hips and the asian large fit well with a lot of room to stretch. the waistband fits well and does not dig into my 27 inch waist. the skirt covers my (round) behind by 2-3 inches. i would expect the size l to fit 0-4 and the xl 4-8 us sizing.  i love these leggings! i was doubting paying the $20+ price tag when there were less expensive options out there but i am so glad i did. once you compare the quality and fit, you know you are getting way more than you paid for. the cheaper legging not only looked cheap it fit so small and the skirt barely covered my behind. it looked awful! take a chance on these leggings. you willl not regret it! -ana with a very modern design, bright colors; the material of the pants are warm, your baby will not require extra coat, unless it is at night these are very nice, not too warm but warm enough for fall nights. they arrived in good time and well packaged. i may have to purchase another pair. these pants are perfect for gym or go between in the winter---very warm.  i am 6\\' 5 &#34; 192lbs, i got a large and they fit perfect! good i bought these pants while still pregnant with my little girl. they fit perfectly after she was born, and i paired it with all her tops. the variation in colors made it easy to match them with just about all her blouses.<br /><br />the elasticized ankle band creates a cute flow at the bottom and allows room for her to move around freely. they wash well because my second child also wore them...go figure. three in a pack!!?? what a deal, i mean, a steal :-) every mom needs these. great pants but just run small for the size they say they are. had to return them. but all in all they are beautiful and warm feeling. shipment was as stated arrived on time. awesome its sewn well enough. it has a few extra strings hanging but i cut those. i washed these about 5 times so far.  i know that these will last a long time. only order these if you are short,  maybe 5\\'4 or 5\\'3 and under. they fit perfectly. they are cheap and so comfortable. i highly recommend these pants. i will be buying some in every color! great pants, perfect for a lazy day at home. love to wear these with my cowboy boots! super cute. i love, love, love these pants. they wear so well and are soft and surprisingly warm. my fourth pair of wallflower brand pants/jeans and i love all of them. my daughter was invited to a military themed birthday party so we needed something with camo but that she wouldn\\'t just wear once wasting precious dollars. add in some pink to make a happy girl and we had a winner. the set fit my three and a half year old perfectly and she enjoyed rocking it at the party. obviously she was indigenous personnel. they look nice, probably should have bought it in smaller size, but hey they\\'re sweat pants. love the pockets, why can\\'t you find pockets in womens sweat pants? men\\'s have them. they are a cheap quality, but honestly most tights dont last long anyways. they are a great design though, becasue footless tights are better with high heels so you arent soo slippery in your shoes. very tight mother really love her jean pj\\'s i bought this to bring my baby home from the hospital... photographs well<br />better quality than others i\\'ve seen! this product is durable and reusable<br />(other baby tuxedos have glued on lapels and are one time use) these alfani iron-free flat front twill pants are extremely comfortable and for me fit very well.  the have a good cut and are well made.  i ordered one pair and tried them and then ordered 4 more pairs becasue they were so comfortable.  look and feel like dress pants but in this \\\\\\\\\"casuaul dress\\\\\\\\\" world.  i am excited that i finally found some pants that i can be comfortable in. i brought for my friend wedding and it was amazing.they had pockets and everything that you could dream of.they kept me nice and cool for the hot and sunny days.love these pants so much please buy a pair,i know you will love them to. didn\\'t take long to get in &.hate them but my kids loved them! lol very comfortable. fits nicely and washes like a dream! wish it came in some more colors and prints. i would definitely buy it. it fits a little weird but not necessarily in a bad way. i\\'m 5\\'8&#34; and 122 pounds, athletic build. they fit my booty very well and look fantastic. it\\'s just the front is a little weird because of the quality. these aren\\'t worth an arm and a leg but they do seem pretty awesome so far for what i got them at. we\\'ll see how they hold up considering the cheapness of the material. i was looking for beige/khaki pants and found these. not sure how i came across these pants but i\\'m glad i did. i\\'ve only worn them once but they\\'re very comfortable, made from quality materials and very flattering. i expected them to be cheap looking but they aren\\'t at all. i\\'m very happy with my purchase and the seller shipped them the day after i ordered them.  i\\'m 5\\'10 and a size 6 in jeans and i got a medium and it fits perfectly. i plan on purchasing more of these! love this for my 3 year old. they give a bit more protection from dribbles and when my son had a poopy accident they held it in pretty well so it would not run all over the place. havent used it yet but its just like i thought it would be. i ordered a large thinking it would be too big but it fits great. these shipped very quickly and fit great and look good. only complaint is the stitching on the inside around the waist is a little scatchy and slightly irritating. this product made me able to discipline my image to the point that i had the strength of a grizzly, the speed of a puma...and the wisdom of a man. these are very comfortable and fit accordingly, will defiantly buy more in all the other colors they offer. great price too! they are so comfy and fit perfectly! however they are a little long for me and i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; and got a medium, and the material is extremely stretchy and kinda thin. good for the price though! bought this item for my two daughters who use them as gym shorts, for volleyball practice and dance and tumbling class and under their uniform skirts. for reference they are 5\\'4&#34; and about 118 pounds.  they fit well and the fabric is very soft. it is a thin fabric but i do not find them to be too see through. i just tell my girls to make sure they use darker underwear underneath. the girls love them and i have purchased four more. fit is good, very comfortable no review<br /><br />this was a gift for my daughter.  it fit well and is just plain cute.  she lves it. slimhot  slimming pants are what they say they are......working out in it makes you sweat alot to shed those unwanted pounds<br />highly recommend. im always nervous about ordering clothing on amazon, but these are fantastic, will buy more. very nice. i have long legs and the length was perfect! great value, very well made much larger than the size but a beautiful garment the t-shirt fits as expected but i know to order up a size on these types of t-shirts. you will get a perfect fitting cute t-shirt as long as you do. this outfit was a hit at the wedding we just went to with our baby boy. it\\'s printed on american apparel cotton so it\\'s cute but still comfortable against babies\\' skin whereas other baby suits/tuxedos may not be. we\\'ve only needed to wash it twice now so i cannot vouch for how well the print holds up but i\\'m sure it\\'s fine. these pants are well made.  thank you.  i really like these camouflage pants, and was very happy to receive them. comfy and perfect for my scary spice halloween costume. a little long, even with 4&#34; heels. i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; and 145 lbs. big bang theory is one of our favorite shows so the boyfriend it totally happy with wearing them and they make me smile when i see the bright colors! nice and comfy! great! soft, comfortable, just fit as i expected. very nice. looks just slim but not skinny, and a little bit athletic. love it! will buy it again. i am happy with my order! i got these in my size & they are a good fit they\\'re not loose but not skin tight where you can\\'t breathe they\\'re perfect in my opinion they\\'re very cute also so i recommend them . üíúüòç these pants are bad ass they fit me baggy but there like that and i really like the camo and the color tan these pants are beat great i bought these pants for my husband, and he is very pleased with them.  they fit well, are comfortable and look great.  i think they are a bit long, but he doesn\\'t, so that\\'s okay with me.  i would have preferred a 29&#34; length, but there is nothing between 28&#34; and 30.&#34; loved them great price and arrived fast! these are perfect for my 21-month-old granddaughter!  she is very active, and needs the warmth of tights in the winter.  they are also very soft, and while they fit well now, they will continue to do so throughout the winter, unlike many of her other clothes!  a very good buy. great first off, i was drawn to the &#34;natalie&#34; brand as advertised, but the pants i received are actually a different brand. i ordered an xl, bc lately i\\'m wearing larger than i\\'m used to and i\\'d rather them be too big than too small. with that said, i\\'m excited to know that if i return them i get to go down a size! will see what the other dancers in my group say about the fit, because they are clearly too big and baggy. material feels nice tho. our town has our yearly spring zucchini sprout festival every year at this time.  it\\'s usually a good time, although i haven\\'t gone for a couple of years because the last time that i went i was robbed of my wallet and \\\\\\\\\"duke lacrosse\\\\\\\\\" t-shirt by some drunken thugs who then stabbed me in the throat and left me for dead on the ground of the beer garden.  luckily, there were a couple of sober people out of the several hundred people there who took pity on me and dragged me off to the side so i wouldn\\'t get stepped on by people who were dancing.  anyway, my girlfriend has been bugging me to go this year, but i just couldn\\'t summon the courage to go back to the site of my humiliation...until i saw these pants on amazon.  when the pants arrived in the white, though dusty plastic package, i could feel the power literally throbbing from the bag.  i tried them on and became a totally different person!  my girlfriend came around the corner and saw me in them and just fell to the floor, demanding that i make sweet love to her right then and there.  anyways, we show up at the festival this year and from the moment that i got out of the car, i heard the crowd gasp and then grow silent.  i strode down the middle of the street, and as the crowd parted, i saw the beer garden tent in the distance, about 50 feet away.  at the bar were the two thugs who accosted me the years before, standing there swilling there beer.  they must have sensed some sort of intuitive terror, because they turned around and there i was.  they looked me in the eye and then slowly down at my pants, and they knew they were in trouble.  i said, \\\\\\\\\"do you remember me?\\\\\\\\\", and at that point i jumped up in the air and gave them both a flying scissor kick to their heads.  the pure energy emanating from my zubaz pants sent bolts of 1538 volt electricity to their hair, which immediately caught fire.  they ran down the street, screaming in terror, and when i last saw them they were engulfed in flames as they turned the corner, running towards the river.  the crowd immediately burst out into applause and surrounded me, giving me high fives, and throwing their women at me.  i bought everyone a round of bud lite in plastic glasses, and the mayor came up to me and made me the parade marshall!  it was the best day of my life! i love this yoga pangs, they are extremely comfortable, they make my butt look amazing, i am tall and they are not short on me (without sneakers they touch the floor on the bottom part), and they are not see through.<br />they are not see through as long as you order the size that fits you, if you order a size smaller that what it should be , then it is going to be see through no matter how good the fabric quality is. love these scrubs! perfect for shoveling snow on frigid days good these pants are worth the money. the colors are amazing. sadly its not uv reactive but the way they packaged it is great. they rap paper around the chains so they don\\'t break. it came 2 or 3 day ahead of time and i love them. there is string at the bottom of them. so you can tie them tight around your ankle. you just will have string hanging from your legs that\\'s feels weird. the pants are a little tight around my waste because the small was too small the big was too big and the medium fit ok but a little tight. it just depends on your personal size. but the pants feel comfortable a litte and i still love them. the chain is detachable and retachable not only that but you can also wear these as shorts. were the blue seem under the pockets with the skulls on them is a zipper that zips the bottom part off and you can wear them as shorts and you can easily zip them back. never have i ever had pants like these they are amazing!!!!!!!!! my daughter loved them and the fit her just right! i love it! it\\'s fits on me love these. perfect for any supernatural fan. i love them. fast hipping too i am tall and normally fit in smalls the best. these were a little too tight for my liking but they are very comfortable and don\\'t give you camel toe. yay! i\\'d probably buy them again in a size up. funky pants, perfect fit! i really love it .........so comfortable and cool. think eventually i will get more colors<br />it is the perfect cover-up to throw on and run to store. quick and comfortable...just my style!<br /><br />five star i love them! comfy i love that these pants fit as expected. it\\'s hard for me to find fleece pants that aren\\'t really snug and these have plenty of room to move around in without being too big. fit great! love the material! very pleased! i am a size 14, and the large fits perfectly. they are super comfortable. i am going to guy six more. greatest deal ever! these are the cutest softest pants. pretty good quality - especially for the price. very happy. they are just a little bit big in the legs but i\\'m only 5 foot tall so that was kinda expected. very cute.  be aware that if your legs are curvacious, it will show due to the clingy nature of this fabric. very comfy! love these pants, they\\'re flattering and durable but they are a very light black and they fade even further with washing.  a little black dye goes a long way with these bad boys. great quality! fast shipment! these scrub bottoms i would say fit fairly like unisex. they fit slightly big or just not a  super fashionable pant. but, they are good for work. perfect fit. never ordered any type of clothing on-line, as i dont always fit into a standard size. these pants are certainly comparable to other more popular and expensive brands. just 3 days after i got them i ordered another pair...that says alot about a product. ! the only thing that would make this a better deal would add more colors..i would be forced to buy even more ! bought this for my wife as one of her christmas presents.  she 5\\'3&#34; 100lbs and they fit perfectly.  got the xs and she absolutely loves them and unfortunately for me wants one in every color now.  highly recommend them.  go great with a long sweater and boots or heels. awesome pants right here! haha i can fit a sheep, some foods from the market, plenty of gems and the guard at the gates battle axe in the crotch of these. alladin would be jealous. c; these \\\\\\\\\"undies\\\\\\\\\" are pretty much as i expected. the fabric feels a little cheap, but that\\'s typical gerber. they don\\'t hold pee, of course - they sort of postpone it, unless it\\'s full force. but of course that\\'s their intended function. the leg holes are a little tight... again, typical gerber, skimping on fabric. i think they are made somewhat cheaply in the end, but you can\\'t beat the price. if you have a rolly-polly baby like i do, just keep in mind that gerber\\'s products run small. beautiful pants in every way, well-made, and the color is even more stunning in person. however, the pants run small. i am a classic medium across the board, but the medium was very tight around the waist. i returned it and ordered a large and hope it will not be too long, as the mediums were just about right lengthwise. bought them for work, great price, great fit.<br />they are a little high rise but with a shirt pulled down makes them look fine beautiful color and soft materials that will be comfortable for a newborn.  it\\'s stupid to require a minimum number of words in a review. i have several &#34;leather&#34; leggings this one is top quality, love them!!looks like real leather and even feels like thin leather i really like wearing this pants. its like wearing pj\\'s all day. i don\\'t know why i\\'m expected to write a specific number of words. i said what i thought already not true to size. i was a bit leery of ordering an xl, as i am usually a size 8, but the fit was perfect. for the price, i was surprised at how well they were made and the thickness of the material - perfect for winter, comfortable and cozy. interested to see if the fabric will pill in the wash. i purchased these at the beginning of my first deployment as a police advisor in afghanistan over a year ago. they have been beaten, abused, and used a lot. the water here used to wash clothes is very harsh, and the environment isn\\'t any better. these pants have held up to everything i have thrown at them. they are washed several times a week, but the fabric remains tough. my heavy duty pants have faded a little, by my pair of lightweights has held the color wonderfully.<br /><br />i have a similar style of pants from another top name manufacturer, and i honestly prefer this cut to theirs. they just feel better for my build. i am an average build and stand 6\\'2\\\\\\\\\" and the 34\\\\\\\\\" inseam still fits me well even though i would prefer just a tad more length that a 36\\\\\\\\\" inseam would offer.<br /><br />overall, i would say that this is the perfect pant for me. i just ordered three more pairs.  thank you tru-spec and amazon. leggings are as nice as expected them to be.  great price. shipping took the full amount of time to ship so make sure you have the month to wait. the material and fit are excellent.  i like the fact that they are a modern style and can be worn every day!  i bought two pairs.  i think you will love them! when i saw my friends elan pants, i quickly ordered them.  they are so comfortable!   never wear them that i do not get compliments on them.  plan to buy more! i order these pants, which my wife likes, as a mother\\'s day gift. the original advertisement came for spiegel. when i ordered them low and behold they were coming from amazon. this issue was i ordered them a week prior to mother\\'s day and they arrived a week after mother\\'s day. so it took two weeks to get an item that was supposedly in stock. i bought these as a 24th birthday present to myself. my bday is not until jul 17th so i got them a little early. i\\'m going to wrap them up and give them to myself lol. a must have for any harry potter fan or hogwarts student in the house of gryfinndor. what can i say i love my ducks and these sweats are so comfortable and made very well! i love them! i\\'m 4&#34;9 and weigh 86 pounds and this pair pinches my hips a little, but they fit my thighs nicely. the material doesn\\'t feel too cheap and gives the pants a good shape and body as i dance around. they look better than a similar pair that had slinky material. i\\'m thinking of ordering another pair because these are priced better and are of  an overall better quality. fit as expected i‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and size 18 in pants they fit perfect i love these pants.  this is the second pair i purchased and i will continue to buy more.  most comfortable pants i\\'ve ever had! i\\'m very satisfied with these pants.  they are as good of a quality you get when you shop in the stores for them.  the length is perfect (most yoga pants are too short for me), but i don\\'t look as good in this color as i thought i would...not your fault.  i would purchase here again when i\\'m in need again.<br /><br />thank you! comfort and style great for working out or as a cover for the bikini you wear to the beach good quality soft material and a sweet pink color that is a must have for your clothing collection love them they fit perfect and the material feels smooth and not uncomfortable at all i liked the pants, they were as described. i found they were a little sheer and hence proper undergarments should be worn. i purchased the medium and it fits perfect. these are stretchy which is good, but a little on the sheer side so wear dark underwear. as they are for a small frame they fit my medium body okay. good material, comfortable feel. bien cute pants to go with variety of onesies 3 years ago i bought 2 pairs as a test & was amazed that the fit is truly perfect--forgiving, understated, easily dressed up or down. now i have about 16 pairs (2 different sizes), more than half in black. be aware the sizing runs just a slight bit large, and after 8-10 washes in cold water they do slightly stretch, making them slightly larger. the latex stretch of them is very invisible but it can also mean the knees bag if you sit a lot. now i have to keep them in two piles in my drawer--one for those that are new enough for work, the other that i\\'ve worn nearly out and have to relegate to the garden.  i need the two piles because even after 3 years it\\'s hard to tell which is which.  the only gripe i have is that there\\'s no pocket though the lack of pocket is part of what makes the look so sleek. can\\'t recommend these enough.  hope eddie bauer keeps making them exactly as now (well, maybe add a pocket option) for many years. i am 5\\'10&#34; with a 32 waist, the pants fit great. i love these yoga pants.  after unsuccessfully trying many in my local stores i was just not happy with the fit.  i went on amazon and searched for the highest ranking pants at a good price and these came up.  i was very nervous at first to make the purchase as i have never purchased clothes online but i was so happy when these came.  they are a little sheer in certain lighting so yes you need to be precautious but the fit compliments my body and they are extremely comfortable.  i am not concerned with the sheer to not wear in public because it\\'s not a super thin sheer in my opinion.  i wear a size 6-7 and i got the medium pair and they fit perfect.  i am 5\\'6&#34; and i didn\\'t feel the length was too long.  i am off to invest in three other pairs because i love them so much!  happy purchasing, you will not be displeased with these pants. i ordered these pants after some trepidation because of the reported issues with sizing; i ordered an xl and they fit pretty much as i expected, maybe a little on the big side. i got them as my everyday summer pants-and they have fulfilled my expectations; i will probably get the brown next time, as i think that it is more of an olive-y green brown. these pants remind me alot of the fatigues that i used to buy from surplus stores when i lived in virginia, and the pants were just piled on tables for you to root through-these are a bit nicer though, b/c they are long enough. i love these leggings!!!<br />the leggings are super comfortable and the print on them is super cute! the only reason i didn\\'t give this all 5 stars is because i\\'m a size 4 and there a little big for me. these are way better than the thin panties you can buy for toddlers. sometimes i put two pair on her at the same time and they pretty much hold all wet accidents. easier to put on and off than disposable training pants. i bought six pairs of these when i started training my son at 18mths. now at 26 months, he wants to still wear these over his character underpants. they are super soft and have no nasty chemicals in the material, just pure 100% egyptian cotton. they are not waterproof  but do hold a fair amount. i thought that was a bonus as my son trained quicker because he knew when he was about to or started to pee. super soft, and does nor shrink up in washer and dryer. great for sensitive skined toddlers. fair trade and made in egypt. love these, socks and booties won\\'t stay on but footed pants are hard to find for some reason.  these are nice quality, soft, not thick but just right.  cute too! great for young and old alike! great fit and comfort and thickness! i live in my yoga pants. i liked them so much that i bought a pair for my mom and grandma and both of them would give them positive reviews as well. the product is everything that i expected, the size, the color and quality.<br />the arrival was before that i expected i would recommend this if you are living or going to visit a really hot place. i love affliction jeans. i have never spent over $100 for a pair of pants in my life. now i\\'ve bought 4 in the last 4 months.<br />love the look, the style and the stares it gets from the women.. love them very much! fit as i expected!  an fyi the waist baby string is just for show perfection!!!!!!!! i am using cloth diapers for my son. i put these over the all-in-ones when i want to be sure he won\\'t leak, like at night, and they are great. i\\'ve never had a leak with these pants, no matter how long it\\'s been since i\\'ve changed him! again fun to wear and different a love them, can\\'t wait for summer.  light weight and comfortable. cute, fun, comfortable, roomy, easy to get in and out of.  a little thin on the fabric but for cooler comfort that works for me!  love them.  good shipping time! i love the color and fabric. runs a bit small. wanted the loose fitting look but barely got it. the pair shoes style jumpsuit is super comfortable and and lightweight for almost any occasion. i love love this jumpsuit good quality pants but should probably not be classified in tall/long because they were way too short. unfortunately, i had to return them. these extra long pants are just that! as a slender 6\\'2&#34; woman, i am always looking for long pants that are actually long enough for my legs. these have a snug sexy fit and they are super long. they are well passed the floor on me, which is exactly what i was looking for. i bought another pair. awesomeness! love these comfy capris. i actually like the way these fit, except they are waaaaaay too long.  i\\'m only 5\\'4&#34; and these pants are just ridiculously long.  like i could have another 6 inches of leg and they\\'d still reach the floor i think.  thought about taking them to get altered, but decided the purchase price plus the alteration expense was just too much for me.  i ended up returning, but didn\\'t want to rate badly as the quality and fit otherwise were great.  tall girls, these will be great for you.  :) i do not see my previous review here so i am going to review them again.<br /><br />i love these pants!<br /><br />i am 5\\'10 and 190 lbs and the large fits great! the pants are perfectly long enough for me, but i need long pants due to my height. i always have a hard time buying pants that are long enough. my inseam is about 35&#34; and these pants just barely touch the floor. i was nervous because i accidentally washed them on &#34;hot&#34; and i thought they would shrink but, much to my surprise and delight, they came out the same length as before the scolding wash cycle :)<br /><br />these pants are super comfortable too! soft, stretchy, and just tight enough to hold in all of the extra bits (love handles, etc). the fold down waist-band really helps smooth lines too. even better yet, they are not see-through!<br /><br />i will definitely be buying more of these pants when i can. they are awesome! great costumer servicd i\\'ve been wearing babysat clothing for over 10yrs now.it\\'s one of my favorite because it complements my body shape . ok fit as expectec like these pants very much. planning to get other colors soon. size fits comfortably and i  it feels very lite when wearing them. i used this all the time, and it picked up sticks and leaves while your proned out and adds to the camo. product was better than expected fits well and is very durable. item made it across the country in 2 days after ordering. superb job. will definately be using again. unbelievably comfortable.  and, come on.  it\\'s rocco!!!! i used these for a christmas gift. i was so happy that i received them very quickly. the person whom got them was very happy with them. love these! for great! tight enough in the thighs but doesn\\'t give a muffin top. also long enough for me! i like them long and i\\'m 5\\' 5&#34;. excellent painter paints at a great price great great and great worked great pants fit well, but i had to get them hemmed at the bottom. (i\\'m 4\\'11, 105 lbs) great workout pants. plenty of room for any exercise. they feel great and fit perfectly. it\\'s been hot here lately and i don\\'t feel overheated in them. good product. high waist slim cut button front stretch casual fitted legging...–ø—Ä–∏–æ–±—Ä–µ—Ç–µ–Ω–∏–µ–º –¥–æ–≤–æ–ª–µ–Ω. –¥–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∞ –±—ã—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—è, —É–ø–∞–∫–æ–≤–∫–∞ –æ—Ç–ª–∏—á–Ω–∞—è. —Å–µ—Ä–≤–∏—Å —Ä–∞–¥—É–µ—Ç. –≤—Å–µ–º —Ä–µ–∫–æ–º–µ–Ω–¥—É—é cool they are excellent these pants are so comfortable.  its like i am wearing pjs to work! the only problem we have with leakage is when my three-year-old holds it and unleashes a ridiculous amount of pee at once.  otherwise no leaks at night.  my daughter also loves the crocodile picture because it\\'s easy for her to tell front from back. these are really comfy yoga pants. i bought them in a size small and they fit great. they were a little longer than i would have liked them to be, but  i am only five feet tall. i love the fabric its soft and cool on your skin and the material isn\\'t heavy which is nice. i can\\'t wait to wear them while working out. nice leggings. soft and comfortable. the color is as shown in the picture. but it\\'s not for people over 5.4 ft tall. planning to order more colors . i normally wear a 3 but i ordered a 5 and the fit is perfect. i love them!! cute super comfy and soft! i\\'m slightly larger in the behind region and thought they might be slightly transparent in the back but they are not. i usually wear a size 7/8 pants size and these fit wonderfully. i have extra room to stretch and there is no camel toe in sight. i highly recommend these! these pants fit well are very comfortable and a great color.  i use them for sleep pants or lounging around the house. i love harry potter and to be able to show off my school pride even if it is fictional is awesome. perfect fit the pants are fitted, so if you have extra junk in the trunk please keep in mind that they well stretch and show all your business.<br />so be sure to get your size and everything will be alright. these were great - nice quality, comfortable, good price.  fit as described - i\\'m happy with them. bought this for my wife,and wow wow wow this outfit looks amazing on her,it is comfortable and crazy sexy.i posted a picture of my wife wearing it. oh and hot flash is a great company,they will bend over backwards to make sure you are happy,i highly recomend them. they are cute, confortable and you can do any execise with them, they don\\'t move or hang arround, but you can do what ever you want, they will stay the same in any position. love the lounge pants!! i got these the other day. love them. so comfortable and soft. i love how baby they are. i have bought a second pair since. love it!! it\\'s really hard to order online for my seven year old, but these pants fit perfectly. i would definitely order again. order a size up and you should be okay. this is my second pair. the medium i ordered previously was way too small. i ordered a large and it fits like a medium would. order a size up. omg, i was a bit skeptical at first because of the other reviews about the sizes and being i\\'m heavy on the top. well i was not disappointed. it wasn\\'t as long as i hoped for but it fit perfectly otherwise and help my twins in tact. possibly the greatest investment in my ems career. i love the pockets on the side which hold all my little tools, and the larger pockets fit my notepad and little guide thing. the smaller pockets fit my cpr mask and its all around amazing. i have gone through dozens of black leggings to try and find the best ones... according to fit and if theyre see-thru. they are the only pair ive found to be not see-thru!! best ever. so comfy! they fit as advertised. i\\'m tall and a size 24 and usually have issues because i don\\'t have an excessively sized booty or hip/thigh area. they fit very well and are long enough as well as comfortable. love these cargos i love this blanket. it\\'s super soft and stretchy! perfect for swaddling and it\\'s my son\\'a favorite.<br /><br />now, it\\'s my go-to baby gift!! fits, as expected.<br /><br />looks good.<br /><br />holds-up well. looks great after almost two years. the workmanship was as advertised but the size was way off.  i saw a review on amazon where a person my size and weight ordered a large and said it was a perfect fit.  that seemed too big for me but i went ahead and ordered a large.  not even close. way to small.  wish i could have kept it. love the look of them!! ‚ô• ‚ô• they did come a little baggier than i was expecting from a size 5, but they fit great hip-wise and the style is awesome. :) great these fit well they do shrink and we bought the long. but love them!<br />the color choices are ok. wish they had orange in long. and regular would be short!<br />they were hand washed and hung to dry but they are so comfy that a little shrinkage is ok!  suggest that material is pure washed in the future. as most things that are india styled seem to share same issues. very comfortable, hearty construction, great for colder weather, and look nice on. can dress down or up. these will become your go-to pants! if you got thick thigh, order xl these yoga pants are great! they are cute, comfy and durable. i love them and have already recommended them to several of my friends. i like these for potty training overnight.  it helps keep the mess to a minimum if there is an overnight accident. i\\'m very satisfied in my purchase of these comfortable baggyz. i wear them for walking,exercise, pj pants and just for relaxing and lounging around in i love these pants, affordable, extremely comfortable and very flattering. i love these pants more than the others i have orderd .... they fit awesome and are to cute... very mc hammer!! very nice pants and is very comfy! i would love it even more if it was a jean kind of type. item was just as described - perfect infact! they are great pants for school. my grandson looks good in them. they wash and dry up  good, too. nice material warm<br />soft<br />good quality<br />confy<br />my kid really enjoy it<br />the freat-super soft-favorite pants that my kid could get<br />thanks i love the fabric.very comfortable. love the color and material!! they fit perfect!  have been looking for a pair of workout pants for a long time and these fit the bill! i\\'m 58 years old and 5\\'3&#34;. length is an issue for me. i saw these on amazon & decided to order them. to say the least i love them. although they were more than i expected to pay i quickly realized that i have paid much more for my favorite jeans throughout my life! i recently read an article that noted that jean sales were on the decline and being replaced by &#34;yoga pants&#34; as the go to outfit. that being said, i will not be giving up my jeans but i will probably be wearing these equally as much! great material & quality. i got this as a gift for my friends two year old, it fits him great and looks comfy on him while still looking like jeans. he moves and plays wonderfully in these stretchy waist pants. my daughter had another pair she loved so bought the same size, xs and it fit as well as the first pair. i\\'m really glad with these pants, they\\'r very comfortable and the stress points like in between the legs (crotch) is reinforced properly. i recommend these pants, if you like what you see in the picture, you\\'ll be proud of what you\\'ll purchase. great fit! look great on my grandma! i bought her two pair. i may buy more colors this is my first review, and with good reason!  the pants are great, especially for the price and compared to other jeggings i have purchased from amazon and elsewhere.<br /><br />i\\'ll start by saying if you are looking for an actual dress pant, then this pant may not be for you.  however, if you are looking for a stretchy jegging that is dressier than the usual cotton blend jegging and yet still comfortable, then this is the pant you want.  i purchased this in the green color, and it is perfect, although the green is slighter brighter than my computer monitor lends.  it is almost like a  st. patrick day green which is really nice.  the fit is low rise, so if you are curvy like me with a little junk in the trunk you will need to wear a belt or risk pulling these up every time you rise from sitting.  the material quality is the best from what i\\'ve found in terms of jeggings and gives a very polished look without all the saggy fabric that i sometimes experience from cotton jeggings. unlike with cotton blend jeggings, the rayon blend has just enough stretch without being too loose or bunching with every turn. the front pocket are faux pockets, but this lends to an overall sleek look.<br /><br />also, it seems from other reviews most people are disappointed because of the sizing.  i would recommend ordering a size up, unless you want these pants to fit extremely tight. for example, i can wear a size small, but they are too tight for comfort or wearing outside of the house. sizing up to a medium still provides a good fit (remember this is a skinny jegging, so unless you are comfortable with showing your curves, avoid these or go two sizes up--at which point they may be too loose) and allows me room to move. for reference, i am 5\\'0, 127-130 pounds, curvy and slightly bottom heavy; size medium fits great.  i will be ordering more soon, because for the price, these are a good quality and a steal.<br /><br />in addition, these are stretchy pants, so to prolong the wear and stretchiness, you will want to hang dry them or else risk them shrinking if placed on a high heat setting in the dryer.<br /><br />finally, i would suggest that you keep in mind that fabric content of jeggings may vary by color and seller.  i contacted alfa global via email after receiving my order to see which other of these pants are also a blend of rayon, nylon, and spandex and was recommended the following colors: light coral, dark coral, light green, dark green, mocha, cobalt blue, light purple.<br /><br />now off i go to purchase more of these in other colors before they are all gone :-)tretchiness, you will want to hang dry them or else risk them shrinking if placed on a high heat setting in the dryer.<br /><br />finally, i would suggest that you keep in mind that fabric content of jeggings may vary by color and seller.  i contacted alfa global via email after receiving my order to see which other of these pants are also a blend of rayon, nylon, and spandex and was recommended the following colors: light coral, dark coral, light green, dark green, mocha, cobalt blue, light purple.<br /><br />now off i go to purchase more of these in other colors before they are all gone :-) love the style and fit of these! they\\'rea lil snug because i was unsure of the m or l. probably shouldve gotten the large but they still fit pretty well, just gotta be sure of which undergarments i choose lol. ps, im 5\\'5 145lbs and it\\'s all in my legs. i also have a short torso w/really long legs so they\\'re a lil short, but most pants for me are i love these lounge wear.  they feel like i;m not wearing anything and i love the pouch.  it is roomy and has enough space for my oversize jewels.  they look hot and sexy at the gym and i get a lot of stares.  love them thanks these were such a nice surprise!  i have been trying to find a pair of pants like this that fit me the way the pictures suggest.  i bought several different types of palazzo pants and was disappointed every time and it was a let down.  i am a massage therapist and was looking for clothing that would look nice but be very easy to move in.  these will be awesome!!!  absolutely going to buy more!!!! these are nice looking pants. they have a higher quality look to them then men\\'s dockers. they fit true to size and the color is vivid. they are comfortable the moment you put them on. <>< i can\\'t wait to wear them! i\\'m so excited! they do have the spandex feeling that sometimes bothers me but it makes the image pop! this is a \\'pre-washing\\' feedback. i\\'ll update it after the pants went through the machine, as things may change...<br />the pants are shiny and soft, a delight to wear, for the girl, and to touch, for the guy.<br />the pants themselves deserve 5 stars, for now. i take 1 star out because, even though i ordered small, the pants are still too large for my 5\\'7\\'\\', 120lb pearl of a wife, and there wasn\\'t an extra-small option. i ordered these in a large for both my husband and son.  they were a little snug so i reordered extra large.  fit was perfect.  very impressed with the quality of the pants.  nice and thick.  will order more when these wear out. very comfortable, great fit.  these pants still look good after being washed. i consider it a very smart purchase. great fit and perfect for running in the winter in minnesota. love them they fit great i am 5\\'7 130 pounds and i ordered a medium. they fit exactly like they should. tight but not too tight. good quality, though the material is a little thin. good for summer. the top part is not too tight, but it\\'s stretchy enough to stay up, which is nice for a strapless! these fit well (i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; and usually wear a size 10), albeit they only just reach my ankles so if you are taller they will be short on you. they are very solid- enough to wear alone. also, they are very durable; they haven\\'t worn out or gotten ripped even when i do circus-arts, which i can\\'t say for other leggings i\\'ve had. they look great too, and the design isn\\'t ruined when they stretch. definitely recommend! these fit my 6 month old daughter perfectly with room to grow.  they pull on easily without being too tight. fit well, lightweight, hope they last. small is too big for me so this extra small really fit well great fit excellent quality have used them for many years,will buy these again. very nice well worth the price they are wondeful bought these for my brother to wear for halloween (he went as rex kwon do) and he got a ton of compliments! he wears them all the time as well, for lounge pants. he can\\'t wait until the 4th of july to wear them in public again! good it doesn\\'t show it in the photo but these are lace, completely see through. they are meant to go over a swimsuit. i wore them with stretch pants underneath. they are really comfortable and the sizing is great. the quality so far is holding up. i have only washed them twice though. have these in 3 colors. love love love them. warm, cuddly, good quality and cute these fit my 5\\'9&#34; daughter just right. love it i will eventually order it!! delivered on time, product as described, i love that design, fits very well, nisce and soft material, still wearing,but always think about missing  poskets on this pants,  thanks i have a 2 year old that fits the size 3-4 garment age. she loves her pants! order arrived promtly and the item is of good quality for its intended use as a halloween costume. i\\'ll have a lot of fun. i wish i could wear these everyday.  so comfy! really a life saver, hold in accidents but don\\'t expect them to work like a pull up because these use natural products for absorbancy they fit nicely. shipping took over a month though, literally slow boat from china. a little tighter fit than i expected, but then again they are jeggings; in any case, i like wearing them with my long t-shirts. i got my order in good time i love my pants there awsome they fit well im a size 14 and i love the way they feel there awsome am so happy i got these thank you so much love them these are very thin, and very soft. exactly what i was looking for. they were a little long (i am 5\\'5) but they cut easily without needing a hem. i now have them in three colors. i bought these and then bought the t shirt to give to my husband as a christmas gift.  both items run a bit small.  they stretch out though. nice arrived as scheduled. son bought these for a costume and we\\'re actually impressed with the quality. would definitely recommend to a friend the actual s/m size did not fit me well. i am a size 7 and they were big! other than that, love \\'em! i bought this as a christmas present for my wife. she loved it and put them on right away. i am happy to say the fit is as expected and they are very soft and warm. approved! i am a plus size girl and have been since i can remember. these days it is getting harder to buy clothes in an actual store considering there are not many retailers that cater to full figured women. i have taken to the internet for most of my clothing needs and i practically live in these type of bottoms when i\\'m not working. they are very comfy soft material and don\\'t have that annoying thin material that you can see through when they are on so that is a bonus.  however they run a tad small so i would suggest a size or 2 larger depending on how you want your pants to fit. kicky pants brand are the greatest especially for warm climates. took a chance and ordered the medium. . . had gained a few lbs. last year and was worried they might be too small.  not so!<br />they fit perfect!!  i\\'m 5 3&#34; and the length is also perfect!  will order another pair soon!  they are a little pricey, but worth every single cent! a little long, but fits great otherwise when the funeral home refused to bury grandma on her harley (it really was messed up in the accident that killed her) we insisted she be buried in her favorite outfit- tube top and zubaz pants. thanks to the wonderful construction of these pants, grandma should be stylish for an eternity while she tools around on her \\\\\\\\\"heavenly harley\\\\\\\\\". it\\'s shinier than i expected, and not form-fitting for me, but overall i like it. wearing them for a leeloo costume, and i think they\\'ll be good to hoopdance in! not too slippery. these pants are so comfortable they feel like pajamas! but so stylish they wear like couture!  well made and fitting. i\\'d recommend them to anyone. seller quick and solid service! super cute but a little big around waist. very comfy and nice print! very comfortable even though they are somewhat small.  cute enough to wear around town. i am 5\\'5 and 145pounds i ordered the large even though i am normally a medium.  so i do recommend ordering a size up. i ordered these for my niece who is a very big bbt  fan and she loves them ! rather thin cloth, not to be worn outside but perfect for the house when sweat pants are too warm very cute and comfortable ... i like the selection of colors and sizes available.  perfect for warmer weather coming up these are the most comfortable pajamas i have ever purchased. they are so soft and easy to slip on. i had purchased these for my sister but when they arrived, i couldn\\'t resist but take them for myself. love the cute print. couldn\\'t be happier! very good nice comfy ! fast shipping! kids love them these pants are very comfy and fit great. i\\'m a size 2-4. i\\'m 5\\'2\\\\\\\\\" and they are perfect length. i would not suggest to a larger person. i would not suggest anyone larger than a size 6 because they could create the \\\\\\\\\"muffin top\\\\\\\\\" look. very nice . bought for my son- he wears them and finds them very comfortable love everything about kickee pants stuff! so crazy soft and cozy. wish we could afford to outfit our children in 100% kickee pants clothing! the pants are really comfortable and smooth. it fits like you would expect from the picture. very nice material and feel to it<br />would recommend! i\\'m usually a hard buyer to please, but these are just awesome! great product. pants are super soft but my girls will have to wait a while until they will fit into them (my babies are 10 weeks old and weigh about 11 lbs.) true to size and so very comfy! love them! they are great for a workout or even wearing out and about. definitely ordering another pair! so comfy microfiber material, washes and holds up nicely, so soft, not the cold nylon or thin cotton of other pants.  i\\'ve had them for years, still hold stretch and bought in total about 6 pairs.  wear them almost everyday! they are very comfortable and perfect for those that do not like the trend of slim fit look in everything even workout clothes. ingenious design.  love it!  people sitting right beside me have assumed they were jeans too. these pants with amazon prime shipping took 2 days to arrive to my house which they would have normally have taken about 2 weeks. quality wise they are very nice and high quality. the texture of the fabric is very soft inside and out. the elastic for the waist is perfect and can stretch out pretty far. the length of these pants are very nice, i wear them on my waist and they go down to my ankle. i\\'m 5\\'4 and my hip size is 36 and my waist is a 26. also these are perfect for hip hop and going out. they are true to size and the material is a little bit thicker, but good for heavy use. very fluid, very comfy, good length - almost like pajamas .. (5\\'6&#34; 190#)  only drawback is they are very, very snug across my rear and you can see pink skin underneath where the fabric is white .. i wouldn\\'t wear them to casual day at work unless i had a tunic to the top of my thighs, but will be cute for a casual dinner, show, etc. the product is nice, but the lenght is super short!! unbelievably high quality fabric for the price.  i\\'m 5\\'9&#34;, 150 athletic lbs and the large fits beautifully.  only drawback for me is the super bright color (which hasn\\'t faded at all with multiple washings) my taste is usually more muted, earth tones, but i wear these as sleep pants, or wear a longer top to cover the eye popping bright waistband.  i machine wash them on delicate, hang dry and the fabric is like new months later. i absolutely adore the kicky pants one-piece. the material is soft and our little one looks adorable! i\\'ve turned into a kicky pants shopaholic. my only wish is for more style/color options. after reading countless bad reviews on lots of other pants like this on amazon, i stumbled upon these yoga pants and the reviews were mostly positive, so i ordered a pair of these pants.<br /><br />let me tell you, i have gone through my fair share of yoga pants and these ones are by far my favorite pair i\\'ve ever had. the fabric is soft and comfortable, all while being durable, lightweight, and not see through. the fold over part at the top is a great addition. even the length is decent, and i ordered a medium. i\\'m 5\\'4&#34; and 140 pounds and they fit nicely.<br /><br />if you\\'re looking for an inexpensive, quality yoga pant, then these are definitely the way to go. i plan to purchase a few more pairs of these soon. just what i expect. very satisfied. i bought these to wear out and about but after an hour or so they stretch so if you are going to buy these one size smaller they are very cute super comfortable fabric i love them very much if only they were a little smaller. good stretch but don\\'t stretch out. seem to come through multiple washings well. the waist folds over, but doesn\\'t get in the way when doing floor positions. the legs are (thankfully) a good length, not too short for my long legs. sort of a light to medium weight. might be slightly see-through in white. the gray and black are fine though. i ordered these for my 10 yr old son.  they fit him perfect!  i am totally happy with the product that i got!  my son has a slender build, so the little adjustable straps on the sides made it fit him great without having to wear a belt. the perfect hat when a winter hat is too much, yet you still want to keep the wind and cold from getting to little ears. stretchy fabric makes for a perfect fit that stays on. my 16 month old loves it. it\\'s one of the only hats he will keep on. they are really cute but too tight on my hips. if they come in a bigger size i\\'ll buy again. high quality, well made.  i would definitely recommend.  very nice pants for the price! omg! this jammy\\'s are so cute on my grand baby and have no regrets in this purchase. she has pretty much grown out of her size 12 months size so i was asked to purchase 18 months and it fits her well. the ease of slipping them on and off is what i like about it especially. i also purchase the pink one just like it with a dog on it. they are so comfortable and stretchy i purchased these on amazon when they were on sale for $75.  for that price i am very happy with these gore tex pants.  my primary use for these pants is while backpacking in fowl weather and snow.  so far they perform well in snow and have full zippers on the outside of the legs so they can be vented easily.  i am trusting the gore tex will perform as well in heavy rain.  they are fairly light and plenty packable for my needs. i was not happy with the leg openings.  there is an elastic strap which creates a pretty  tight cuff that doesn\\'t fit properly over low to mid high boots.  if you have higher boots that come well above your ankle these will fit nicely.  i opted to carefully remove the elastic to open up the leg opening like a normal boot cut pant, much better now.  i am 5\\'11\\\\\\\\\" ,160-165 lbs and wear 31-32 pants.  i purchased these in medium and they fit me well.  i think the waist might be tight for anyone over a 32/33 waist size.  there are no belt loops though so you will want them snug.  there is good room in the seat for movement but not so much to look or fit oddly.  i think these are a good choice.  they are made in usa and seam tough so far.  i have done a little bushwhacking and no rips or tears yet. i\\'ve been rockin\\' my zubaz for months.  seriously, i don\\'t take \\'em off.  they rock at pickin\\' up chix at wal-mart \\'cause they don\\'t notice yer missin\\' teeth.  i ask \\'em back to my house for some tuscan.  they know what i\\'m talkin\\' about.  we slide in my badonkadonk and i flip on the cassette player with the jensens booming and as long as maw\\'s not home it\\'s hot shot city all night, baby.<br /><br />zubaz + wolf shirt (xtra tight) = bitchin\\'<br /><br />it\\'s like yer not a man and not quite an animal either.  just flex and yer kinda like a mananimal.  chix dig that in a husky, musky, hai karate, possible serial killer kind of way.  even my cousins like \\'em. you\\'ll rock the roller rink with yer zubaz \\'cause they scratch real good and when you sweat they put stripes on your testicles.<br /><br />recommended. so sexy!!!! ok this item has a high waste on it, which is great for those with a little extra around the mid section.  only thing is that is has a seam around the mid section area and it takes away from the smooth wet legging look.  i purchase two pairs and after trying them on, i returned them back sure this is one fault.  by the way they are a great price, my girlfriend and i purchased the same pair of pants, she got her from rodeo drive at the cost of $35 and i got mines from amazon for the fraction of the cost.  she was blow away when i told her the amount.  so i rate this product at a 4, if it wasn\\'t for the seam it would get a 5 star. well made and cooler than a bow tie i just received these pants today.  i will write an updated review after wearing the pants for some time, but for now, these are my initial thoughts.<br /><br />i am 6\\'4&#34; 210-220 lbs with an athletic build.  i purcahsed these in a large/long.  the tag states the waist is for 35.5-39.5 inches.  i usually wear a 34 or 36.  these pants are max 36 and with the side tabs pulled tight they would probably fit a 30&#34; waist.  i noticed this as soon as i took it out of the package. i didn\\'t think i would be able to fit in the pants.  however, because of the pull tabs, the pants fit me perfect but if i was a 38 these would probably be too small.  the length was perfect for what i like, i like my pants a little baggy and long.  overall, for me, they are a great fit.  if i was 6\\'6&#34; the length would probably still fit me.  so, with the sizing, buyer beware.<br /><br />the color is spot-on, bright, not faded.  the color and pattern match the rothco\\'s long sleeve t-shirt i got and the boonie perfectly.<br /><br />the material is a little stiff but maybe a wash or two will soften them up, but even if not, they are still comfy and look to be a durable material.  they are not heavy duty but they are not light weight either.  i have another camo pant from proppers that is roughly halft cotton and half nylon.  they seem to be a little softer, but they are also older and washed many times.  not sure if it is the combination of material or age of the other pants.<br /><br />my only complaint, besides the sizing being a little off, is that the front slash pockets are not very deep, or as deep as i would like them.  it seems things could easily fall out when crawling, running, or maybe even sitting.  this my be specific to my pants though.  i would have liked to have deeper front pockets.  the rest of the pockets on the pants are big and deep.<br /><br />i would definitely recommend these and would give them 5 stars if the front pockets were deeper.<br /><br />i will write an update after wearing them for a few months. this is my second purchase of this product, you can\\'t beat it!! the quality ,  the price it\\'s all there. for value this product is a great choice. so comfy. i bought 4 pairs and wear them all the time. they run really big, though. i gave this 5 stars because it was exactly what i wanted. it fits perfectly and i plan to buy more colors. very quick shipping as well. highly recommended. old glory! enough said. oh and the pants are very comfortable. there are what was expected. regular every day tights with the glorious colors, red, white & blue. nice comfortable fit i got these as a cheap alternative to the tripp godfather pants and i\\'m so glad i did.  i think they look better because they\\'re less cluttered and unlike the other ghast pants i have they aren\\'t noisy when moving around.  the material feels nice but it doesn\\'t feel all that durable.  comfy and they look great. great pants keep you warm and dry, i wear them 5 days a week riding my bike to work. my only drawback would be the crotch area.<br />they should make a pair particular to bikers, the crotch should be reinforced as it pills and wears out from wearing and the bike saddle these are so cute!  he looks like he\\'s going to the gym but he\\'s stuck in his bouncer.<br />these little pants are a little something special beyond plain pants.  great quality and he looks so comfortable.<br /> can\\'t go wrong with carters. it was exactly what we ordered, no problems with this order, no need for lengthy comment yadda yadda yadda ok i paid around $20 for these pants. they fit like cushy running tights, but not quite so snug. i also own much more expensive running pants and tights, but these are my favorite. both comfortable and a high quality feel. the stirrups were a new concept to me, but i really like them. on days you don\\'t want to use the stirrups they can easily be tucked up inside the pant leg, but i usually just use the stirrups because they are nice! highly recommended. these are the best pants for the money. they are great.<br /><br />now for sizing. all i know is i am 5\\'8&#34; and 145 pounds, cross country runner, my jean size is a 30-32. the medium size of these pants fit me perfectly. they also are fairly adaptable with an elastic waist plus a drawstring, and flexible construction. 5\\'6 130 ish lbs & medium fits great.  the pants are a little sheer but they are white (why i gave 4 stars) defines my booty well. will buy from seller again. these are great!  wear with heels or boots or even flats, pretty much any cool season.  paired with a batwing shirt talk about a fantastic outfit! the only thing is they do fit a little tight, i\\'m 5\\'3\\\\\\\\\" and weigh about a buck...medium might be to long with my short figure skater legs.  hope this helps! the pearly white color is a great contrast to the black bones. they look even better in person than in the pic. the details on these things are amazing. cool print! soft feel! perfect fit! great purchase! you wont be dissapointed! nice lounge pants, held their shape through washings.  did shrink, but only a little. it is a little tight but that is usually how every pair of pants fit me. i have wide hips and its hard to find a pair that fit right its either tight or to loose and these are just about perfect one of the best i have bought in a while. they run slightly large but are very durable and good quality, so our child will wear these for a long time. good value! i was a bit worried when i saw &#34;xs&#34; because i have a lot of hips but these are so stretchy that it worked out just fine. it hugs your body just right. i am in love true to size and still wearable as baby progresses. (my gal is on the big side and she\\'s still fitting well now at 4mths). i like this material so much, stretches well. cool & comfortable. perfect for hot weather. its different from the other lovable friends stuff i got. strongly recommend these pants feel and look great. very comfortable fabric and i love the embroidered lotus. i only wish they came in petite sizes, as i have to have them hemmed. joyful a bit on the small size the pants fit perfectly and they got here way before the estimated time of arrival. way cheaper than zumba pants! excellent fit man i am so glad i found these. its so rare to find a pair of comfortable pants that are also so dang stylish. normally i have to settle for boring sweats if i want this much room for my package, now i got some slick stylin zubaz pants to strut around in. the ladies will love them, you can wear them to work and then keep them on when you get home for pajamas. best pants ever, its either zubaz or i go naked. i really like these pants. i\\'m 5\\'8&#34; and they are appropriately fitted to my body. the &#34;stretchy part&#34; of these pants is pretty comfortable too, but my only complaint about that is the elastic is underneath the pant leg = a little itchy/uncomfortable. it\\'s pretty bearable though, once you get use to it! overall, i would recommend these pants to anyone who is looking for something comfortable/stylish! : ) i\\'m 6\\'2&#34; with long legs. these yoga pants are perfect! i want to wear them every day. i only wish there were more color options other than black or brown. still, considering ordering another pair in black, so i\\'ll have two exactly the same. so happy with these! yes perfect i loved these pants ..fits exactly how i thought it would and i love the style of it . . i gave it a 4 stars because there is no but lifting to these jeans don\\'t believe the hype but they are extremely comfortable if u are looking for something comfortable to slip in than these are your jeans great these are my second pair of these pajama pants.  great value.  they are extremely soft and comfy.  the colors are vibrant and pretty. it\\'s strange that they only come in one size.  i am 5\\'6&#34; and they are the perfect length.  they are probably best for a slim build. they fit and looked exactly how i expected them to ! wore them to a concert and even my friends that i went with said that they loved them :) this product was a great purchase. it was cheap and i wear it all the time whenever i wear dresses or skirts. highly recommended. the material is a nice stretchy jean. soft. fits really well. came in a super timely manor. first time i have ever ordered jeans online. only thing i don\\'t like is that they are more of a midrise than low rise. great old-fashioned training pants.  these are hard to find. have 5 of them in different colors ! love it! these tac pants exceeded by expectations.  they have a roomy fit without being baggy and a longer waist than most tac pants i have worn.  the best part is the fabric:  it is almost as heavy as a canvas and works great when in the brush to protect the legs and also does not tear.  if there can be one (sarcastic) downside: is there such a thing as too many pockets?  i will definitely be purchasing more of these. the pants quality was great but its a bit big on me i may have to take it in these little britches are just adorable! the fit is great, not binding and the legs are long enough for some growing room, they don\\'t fall off during crawling and they are very soft. lovely trousers; but, on the third order that i made, through amazon, the price was quoted as 47.70/pair, which i thought was a pre-father\\'s day sale price; but jos. a bank added an extra charge for the trousers to reflect the price of 59.90/pair which i had paid previous to what i assumed was a reduction.  that seems a bit misleading to me, either on the part of amazon or jos. a bank.  would be nice if one or the other would be completely accurate in their price quotation.  otherwise, i have no complaint about the products\\' looks or quality. purchased these for my wife for her daily workouts and she really liked them. good fit and very comfy to wear. my daughter wears these pant and loves these fila warm ups.  they are very cute and light weight. she doesn\\'t ever complain about them. love these! at first i was a little bit skeptical about ordering pants online because i have a big ish booty and really short legs, but these fit really, surprisingly well and are a good length. they are comfortable, soft, and just great! these are nice pants. i was worried they\\'d be too tight, but they are not. i ordered a medium (blue) which is my usual size and they are very loose which i like and was hoping for.    the material is good. it\\'s not too thin or see through. in the past i\\'ve purchased pants and they have been thin and see through which is just terrible. they should not make pants like that. this material is also pretty good at not collect pet hair which is also what i was hoping for. some pants collect pet hair it like a lint roller. this doesn\\'t really repel it, but it doesn\\'t collect it like some pants i\\'ve had in the past.    the inside of the pants ... i guess they are a bit like sweatpants. it\\'s not terrible. i prefer smooth pants inside and out, but i do like these and will wear them around when i want to lounge. good product, good price. i work at a gym and do group exercise.  i absolute love the way these pants fit and look.  i bought my sister a pair and she wants more. they r a nice fit i like a lot now don\\'t always believe in one size fits all because i\\'m 5&#34;5 1/2 180 pounds now it would seem like i\\'m a big girl right?? but i\\'m african american so you already know it\\'s more rear end than anything..:-) but i have a small waist so luckily they fit ok..i don\\'t have a stomach pouch so the waist  band fits really good.  however, if you have thick thighs and a huge rear end you may want to reconsider... good value for money pants exactly as described.  extremely comfortable, its like wearing your pj\\'s, but they are very nice to go out in. you can dress them up with a nice blouse (which i have).  they are extremely versatile.  you can wear them at home lounging, with a dressy top to go to dinner in. this is my 8th pair &  hoping they do not go out of style anytime soon!  i love them!!! i purchased these to for some craft work and they worked perfectly, i would highly recommend to anyone searching, great overall. i ordered this for my 3 year olds birthday party. it fits a little snug. thats my new favorite pair of pants. i\\'m in love with it this costume was overoll wery beuttiful im5.5&#34;and way128lb pants was little long but i can fix them.color i love it,shiping and handleing too much money but i love my costumu these were perfect for my halloween costume! i like it. it was good i bought two pair one gray in 3x it was more of a 2x and the second pair a black 3x where a lg size wish they had bigger sizes they are soft just love them and the ones.that didnt fit gave to my daughter and she loves them.. sizeing is way off thought..üòâ these are the best. .when i dance in class, , the tongue moves and the class goes wild. ....they\\'re sift,,, easy wash and hang up to dry...comfortable and crazy trendy....baggie in the seat,,, just a great fun pair of pants.. great fit.  a belt loop was un attached at the base.  no big deal as i just sewed it back on, but a pain to find time to do so.  soft material.  i am interested in getting another pair, perhaps in denim. best jeggings ever!!!  fit great, just way too long.  nothing a tailor can\\'t fix! great for walking your pet in cold and wet weater the description says these are great for daily wear...and i have tested this quite thoroughly the past month or so.  i originally bought one pair of these & at that time there was only 2 colors in my size available.  when they arrived i went to amazon to write a glowing review & i saw they added more colors...so i bought 2 more pairs - because they\\'re just so nice!!! well i probably shouldn\\'t have done that, since i\\'ve worn these pants probably 5 days out of the week now ever since (i work in sports, so i\\'m not required to wear anything too nice - these with an adidas or nike shirt are just fine for my job...but i think even they\\'re wondering if i own anything other than yoga pants anymore).<br /><br />these are *amazing* - they are soooo comfy - when i first saw them i laughed when i read \\\\\\\\\"luxurious\\\\\\\\\" & thought they were just trying to sell their pants.  they aren\\'t - while i think luxurious might be a bit too strong of a word - there\\'s something about these pants that\\'s just really really nice...<br /><br />they do run long - longer than any of the other yoga pants i\\'ve ever tried.  i\\'m 5\\'6-5\\'7 & these flap over my a heels just a bit.  i bought the large (i\\'m just under 150lbs right now) - which fit pretty well.<br /><br />the colored band is surprisingly strong - which i like it helps keep those extra pounds a bit more hidden.  but one thing that made me a bit sad was one pair seems to have stretched out just a bit at the waist - i find myself constantly pulling them up now.  i\\'m super gentle when washing my clothes (like borderline ocd about it) - so i doubt it was anything i did...but i wonder if maybe the coloring process for that pair weakens the fabric a bit?  i don\\'t know - all i know is they seem a bit looser around the waist.  i did lose a few pounds since buying these - but not much - just 4-5lbs so far, & since it\\'s only an issue with one pair, i doubt it\\'s the weight loss that\\'s playing a factor.<br /><br />the pant legs are also a great durable fabric that won\\'t bud from friction.  my thighs still touch right now (just barely...but enough to drive me mad) - and for some of the other pants i bought this was an issue & the fabric beaded up & got all nubby from the friction.  while i can definitely notice a difference in the softness of the fabric in that area, there\\'s nothing visibly different that the friction has caused.<br /><br />like i said - i\\'ve worn all three pairs for weeks now - they\\'ve stood up wonderfully to the wear & the washing with the exception of the one light green pair (which i\\'m still wearing...i\\'ll probably keep wearing them until they literally fall off).<br /><br />i just really hope these are still around in a few months since i might need to buy some more in mediums (if i\\'m able to keep up the weight-loss momentum)...while i\\'ll be thrilled to keep losing the weight - i\\'d be so sad if these didn\\'t fit & i couldn\\'t get replacements!!<br /><br />_____________________________________________<br /><br />update - i finally found another pair of yoga pants i love almost just as much - the [[asin:b00daqmoo6 pattyboutik stretch foldover waistband bootcut lounge sport athletic yoga pant]].  the fit is perfect - and almost identical to these.<br /><br />the differences:<br />1) the material is definitely not as thick as these - but still much thicker than the literally dozens of other yoga pants i have tried at this point (yeah...my yoga pant obsession continues...while i love these - i crave a color other than black!!!)<br />2) the length - the pattyboutik ones aren\\'t as long - they just barely touch the floor on me (5\\'7\\\\\\\\\"; i normally wear a 33\\\\\\\\\" inseam to get that 1/2-1\\\\\\\\\" hangover in jeans) - literally just barely (these - the alki\\'i ones - have about 1/2-1\\\\\\\\\" extra that flaps over my heel - which is just the way i like my yoga pants to be).<br /><br />but the fit on the pattyboutik ones is nice enough for me to put them up there alongside these - mainly because they come in a color other than black (for the legs).<br /><br />also - if your thighs on the thinner side (well - thinner than mine i guess - mine are pretty much still just barely touching...most days at least) you should also check out the t-party yoga pants - the material on those is comparable to these - thick, quality pants.  but my thighs felt like i was wearing compression pants - so unfortunately the fit on those just don\\'t work :( shame since they have a ton more colors.r the legs).<br /><br />also - if your thighs on the thinner side (well - thinner than mine i guess - mine are pretty much still just barely touching...most days at least) you should also check out the t-party yoga pants - the material on those is comparable to these - thick, quality pants.  but my thighs felt like i was wearing compression pants - so unfortunately the fit on those just don\\'t work :( shame since they have a ton more colors. snug and soft. no place to hide anything. great for running. don\\'t be shy if you\\'re buying. your package is up and out there. great! stretchy material and bright colors! very nice but really is more of a womens yoga fit [[asin:b00ehl4cc0 cheetah racing bodies men\\'s cotton elastic draw string pajama pants]]fit as expected. nice feel to the material - very similar to t-shirt material, but a bit heavier. should wear well.[[asin:b00ehl4cc0 cheetah racing bodies men\\'s cotton elastic draw string pajama pants]] my daughter loved the set. very soft and comfy. i love these pants!! they fit me like a beautiful glove. they are great quality and shipped quicker then expected. their pretty shiny but not blinding; great for everyday occasions or for a night on the town. very breathable and comfortable. i\\'m going to order a back up pair. i just love them! this dress fit my newborn girl, and she is still wearing it at nearly 6 months.  it seems to grow with your baby!!  the twilight color is specially nice on a blue-eyed baby.  i dressed it up for fall with baby leg warmers and a sweater. these pants make me feel beautiful and curvy. they definitely turn heads! my hubby loves them on me. they are not thin material but actually a thinker cotton, the placement of the stitching &#34;darts&#34; give your bottom a rounder appearance for sure. if your on the fence order them. i am a size 8-10 with a 30-31 inch waist and the large fit like a glove. üòâ shipped fast love them! small hole in crotch i am very happy with my purchase of two pairs of these cords.  i had been looking in all the local stores & none of them were carrying them.  i had purchased two pairs about five years ago & hadn\\'t been able to find any more since.  they are not too heavy nor too thin; just right for these northern winters.  since i purchased these, i happened to find them at penney\\'s, but they were more expensive! i love these sweatpants. i rated a 4 instead of a 5 for one reason only. these sweatpants do not have pockets. if not for this fact, i would order a few more pairs. other than that, i was satisfied with this purchase. these pants were so soft and lovely but the top seam/elastic and the seam two inches down perfectly accentuated my muffin top. i\\'m 5\\'3.5\\\\\\\\\" and 124lbs. chose a medium in these pants. love em.... good quality set yourself apart from every other hulkamaniac out there with the legging tight pants! favorite pants!! love them! longer than i expected! great as pretend jeans and a down vest! these are the most comfortable pants i\\'ve ever owned. i love them. just bought a pair for my daughter. i could wear these every day! these are great pants.  very comfortable around the waist.  loose without being baggy.  deep, comfortable pockets.  i like how the &#34;hidden cargo&#34; pockets have a small stiched area in the back that is the perfect size for a wallet or cell phone.  you can have your wallet tucked away on the outside of your leg just above your knee.  it stays put and makes carrying things in your pocket much more comfortable and secure. the leggings fit pretty well when i first put them on. i went out with them on and as i was dancing and moving they kept slipping down and giving me saggy crotch! i just wish they had been tighter in the waist and crotch. definitely wearing them again though. i love this product and my son is wearing it for potty training.<br />i can see that he is wearing it happily as the material is soft.<br />my son is 2 years old, 16kgs. this training pant fits him nicely.<br />thumbs up! the bands are soft, and hold pants together securely and come in two sizes, which is great. they worked really well for the first eleven weeks of my pregnancy. the only caution i would share is they only hold your button together, not the zipper. so i did have issues with certain pants, where the zipper would creep down. more a problem with the zipper itself, than these bands. with a knife to have fun pockets but otherwise awesomem. i would have  gave it 5 stars but a size small is a bit too big. it dont hug me as they should. good fabric tho and it feels great tho. i like these pants a lot, the color is very nice, and they\\'re true to size, they do look a little cheap, but it\\'s fair for the price i paid, they\\'re excellent for lounging. just what i wanted/epected love! i love these jeggings. they have a legging feel/comfort, but look like jeans.<br /><br />i trusted the reviews that they fit a little big and to get a size down. for the most part, they were right. by the end of my day they fit perfectly. the only problem, which i\\'m certain is due to them being a size smaller, is that they pull up a little high in the front, creating a bit of a camel toe.<br /><br />otherwise, these jeggings make my butt look great, and fit well. they bunch up a bit at the bottom, (i\\'m 5\\'7, by the way) but for a casual day to day look this is perfect. these were perfect! like above review my son\\'s favorite show is the big bang theory.  the lounge pants arrived nicely and nothing is torn which is a good thing.  son will love it i bought these pants and love the way they fit with the exception of how baggy they fit on my rear. also, they are long: i am 5\\'8 and they looked cropped on me. regardless,they are exceptionally comfortable.  i believe i will get my moneys worth as i will probably wear them throughout the remainder of my five months. i needed a pair of black slacks for a last minute &#34;invite&#34; ... these were perfect!  the relaxed fit and &#34;rich&#34; look were great.  i didn\\'t feel like i had thrown something together at the last minute!  they also washed nice (didn\\'t even have to iron) ... ready to wear again. they were ok slightly larger than expected. quality and look are exactly as what you see in the picture. love columbia.  i wish they would make these pants in more colors-especially the straight leg, but this boot cut also.  very comfortable, wash and air dry overnight.  great pant. i loved these pants, they fit very well, must wear a small to medium size heel, so they dont drag. but i got so many compliments on them, and they are figure flattering, ordered another pair. even though i had to return the trousers because they were too small.  i would definitely purchase a bigger size if it were available.  the quality of the pants, both fabric and stitching, was the best i\\'ve seen in years.  the pants are too heavy for hot places however.  even then, i strongly recommend them.  just remember to order them approx. four sizes larger than what you normally wear. love these it\\'s running little bigger, but better bigger than small. otherwise i love it! they are slightly transparent, but good for the gym really comfy and fit great! they seem a little long, though... they seem more like around the house capris to me. great product ordered a 0-3 for my 1 month old and it fits her great with some room to grow. she has several of these outfits. highly recommended. i purchased these petite yoga pants because all my yoga\\'s are getting shoddy.  these are a little more $ than some but they feel like silk and give you strong, but not uncomfortable support.  i had to have them hemmed anyway because i am barely 5 feet tall.  mind you i am no skinny minny. i am 200 lbs and they still have plenty breathable room at the waist so keep that in mind.  but in these type pants i always get a large or x large.  i am happy.  the hemming cost me $6. i am happy with the sale. first, i\\'d like to point out that the drawstring is fake, as in you can\\'t use it to tighten the waistband... now that that\\'s out of the way, these pants are amazing! i got a size l in the blue with white trim, and i love them!  i\\'m 5\\'6 and 155lbs. they don\\'t sit too low naturally, but you can pull em up or push them down to wherever they\\'re comfortable on you. i love that they are a slim fit but yet baggy, as to not feel like leggings, but still feel like sweatpants. they are long down to my ankles. the waistband is extra stretchy, so they\\'re perfect for lounging. i\\'m about to buy more! highly recommend for the price! even though i ordered my true size it was somewhat too big but i can still wear it. love that i got it super fast. nice fit. fast delivery love these pants, the fabric is soft and thick enough to protect my baby\\'s sensitive skin. love the organic cotton. the feet are smaller than expected, but fortunately my baby can still wear them because i bought a size bigger and the pants are long enough his heel can use some of the leg space. these pants are so comfortable and great quality! i asked them for faster shipping and they responded very courteously and promptly. i got my order in a few days, actually faster than they said it would be! this is a great price too! i had been looking everywhere for something like this! it\\'s a beautiful pattern as well. definitely will order again and i think others will be just as happy if they order from these people. this is one very happy customer! thank you! =) i got a size large i\\'m 135 and they fit great. i love these pants. i don\\'t know if they\\'re supposed to be for yoga but i\\'m wearing them to parties. i like the really high waist, and i like that i can also roll the waistband over shorter, too. the fabric is nice and thick and they seem well constructed. can\\'t complain! comfortable just what i was hoping for. the pants are awesome...great for dressing up...will be ordering more?..good fit...very comfortable...ive loved these kind of pants for a long time as other reviews have mentioned, these pants are quite baggy. i ordered them based on this fact hoping that they would fit my thighs, hips, and rear, which are not tiny. i normally wear a size 14-16 pants and the xl is actually large on me, though i\\'m not sure anything smaller would have fit well. they do not cling on my thighs, though sometimes they are a little restrictive when stretching in a hurdler position. they are also pretty long (i\\'m about 5\\'5&#34;), so they really bunch up at my ankles, but i\\'m okay with that look. the biggest disappointment (and thus why i didn\\'t award 5 stars) is that the bands and clips that cinch the ankles, waist, and side pockets do not hold their position. thankfully the elastic band at the waist isn\\'t too big, so they stay on me anyway. the bands could probably be knotted for style/hold. i wish the material was a little more breathable too, but this is secondary to a good fit for me. definitely worth it for the price, in my opinion. my daughter loved this pants. soft easy to wear. washable all around goodness. exactly as advertised. excellent quality. my wife likes them. fits well. it\\'s a spandex leggings.. for average size women like myself it\\'s a bit too tight but comfortable.. it you like the skinny leg look, this item is it! these leggings kick ass. design is a little fuzzy up close but looks fine if you\\'re face isn\\'t right in front of them... overall, wicked sweet purchase for a reasonable price (: super nice fabric, very soft. strong stitching and the gusseted crotch means that they won\\'t wear out in the washing machine like other low-quality yoga pants do. ok i get compliments every time i wear these..<br />& i\\'m quite sure i\\'ve posted a review already... is amazon becoming a bit of a publicity hound!!! update: after ordering different colors, i discovered the length is not consistent. this isn\\'t a huge deal to me, but it may be to some. my white pair hits right at my ankles, the navy pair goes down to the tops of my feet. also, one of them needs to be mended where there is now a small hole where the waist is attached to the top of the pants. i still love them and wear them all the time, but they are beginning to show signs of wear now after multiple washings.<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />i wanted something flattering with my ample curves, very comfortable and that could be worn with a variety of tops for everyday wear without having to change if i want to go out. these pants fit the bill perfectly.<br /><br />i am 5\\'6\\\\\\\\\" and usually wear 18w, so i ordered a 2x. the fit is great. the pants are on the longish side, but not enough to be a bother. i can adjust the top enough and fold it over to compensate so i\\'m not tripping over them.<br /><br />i have had other pants made with this material, so i knew what to expect. it\\'s lightweight and extremely soft!! it is comfortable enough to sleep in if that\\'s what you want but pretty enough, you can dress them up by choice of shirt and accessories.<br /><br />others complain about it being see-through but unless it\\'s held up directly to light and you\\'re actually looking for it, i don\\'t find that to be a problem. if i were wearing these in very cold weather, i\\'d probably have something underneath for warmth because it\\'s a thin, flowy material. but otherwise, i have no issues wearing these anyplace.<br /><br />they are fun to wear! they make me want to dance around the house and watch the flow about. ha! in fact, i just ordered 5 more pair in different colors because i\\'m that happy with them. comfort-oriented creatures will be pleased. :) was not expecting much bc of the price, but was super surprised and excited when they arrived. fit great so soft perfect for yoga. got lots of compliments! buying a second pair and one for my yoga instructor! nice and comfortable! i &#60;3 these on my wife, she wears them for cosplay and it gets a lot of attention ;-) cute mom pants to run out in and they make my butt look great! these will be awesome to run out with in boots and a sweater this winter, i need to get another pair. fyi the size 14 fit fine, a little long in the leg actually and i am 5\\'7&#34; love them. wear them every night to bed. light weight and cute design, i liked it. delivery took a little longer than i\\'d wanted, but still received it way before the expected delivery date. the pants fit as expected and the material is nice. they are comfy and fit amazing. have not washed them yet, so may update after. but right now quite pleased. i\\'m 6\\' 3/4&#34;. the inseam is plenty long enough. i was just looking for something to wear underneath my skirts and this is just the thing. fits good i have purchased these pants in 3 colors, i love the fit and the comfort of them. i am tall at 5\\'9 and they are long enough. these do a great job of catching pee for the training boy. legs for snug. my boy is lean and the legs are almost too narrow for his thighs to fit through (oddly, this is the case only with the striped ones).  otherwise fantastic. i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; and weigh 135 lb and the mediums fit perfect! that being said they fit like petites, so if you\\'re on the taller side i\\'m not sure if these will work, but i love them! great stretchy no one knows i wear these only in the summer time due to the area in which i live. comfortable and hassle free. great fitting product and i could not find anything better on the market. nice fit and comfortable. fast delivery. nice fit, nice weight, seem solidly constructed.  also comfortable. not much else could be expected from sweat pants. these silk pants are a sheer delight.  extremely comfortable, easy to put on, and gorgeous.  the silk has the perfect weight, drapes nicely, and maintains its beautiful color.  it has the most wonderful feel on my skin.  i get compliments whenever i wear them.  they are great to dress up for a party or evening out.  a fabulous deal, well worth the price. i personally love my shorts and got nothing but compliments when i wore them. however, i am small framed person and always have been. i know many reviewers complained that sizing was inaccurate and i can see why. i did order 2 different sizes just in case. there wasn\\'t much difference but i would reference them this way: i usually need a 00 in any pant. the size small fit perfect. the size medium fit but fit more perfectly my friend who is usually more a size 0-2. i hope that helps! they are super super cute i wasn\\'t sure that these pants would be very good quality, but they are really soft and well-made. my husband practically lives in them! these jeans are a perfect fit. they are comfortable and long enough for me (i\\'m 5\\'9). i was surprised at the perfect fit.  i only wish i would have ordered more since they are now sold out. they are fun and fit well. good! love them, we are not quite ready to start training but it won\\'t be long. every child trains at a different stage. i am borderline plus size and these fit beautifully, although i hang them to dry.  with a tunic and scarf i feel like a retro 70\\'s girl (which i am) -- or i can dress it up for business.  i love that yala is a green company and found this on their website which helps explain why their prices might be higher than some  (btw, prices lower here on amazon).  i think they are about inseam 33&#34; - i am 5\\'8&#34; tall 33 inseam 49-44-48 weight 220.<br /><br />our bamboodreams clothing and bedding is oeko-tex certified. this certification screens for harmful substances present in textiles. it guarantees the safety of our fabric and dyes and is an additional assurance that we are using environmentally friendly production methods.<br /><br />our fabric is dyed using only low impact, azo-free dyes. we have seen how the dyed water is cleaned by micro-organisms and, after testing for purity, it is reused by the factory.<br /><br />we have learned that partnerships grow through honest and open communication, no matter where you live in this world. we are committed to maintaining strong ties to the factories and workers who make our products by visiting the factories, speaking with the workers, and celebrating special occasions. we value our friends and partners around the world. the size that i received was a little bigger than what i was expecting.  i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; and 108lbs and the size small isn\\'t as tight on my legs as i was hoping.  however they\\'re really cute leggings, i wore them a lot around christmastime.  very warm and cozy. they run a little bigger then i thought but not to much. there strong and the army name has been washed three times and is not fading away. arrived on time and they work amazing! i\\'m a dude and had it for the burn and it was perfect. these are exactly as they are advertised and are made well. they\\'re just a little too snug for me so i\\'ll have to lose a few pounds to fit into them but i\\'m inspired by these pants! very comfortable pants for my type of work. especially like the ease of ordering and the fast shipping.will definitely do more shopping to avoid long lines and traffic jams at the malls. just what we needed. they are soft, thick (although don\\'t expect them to contain &#34;big&#34; messes,) and the fit is good. the price beat comparable items.  i actually got a size up to account for shrinking (there was none that i could tell) and to make it easier for the little one to handle herself. i would buy these again! fit is excellent. soft but the material doesn\\'t feel cheap. got them for so as a xmas gift and he loves them as pajama pants. great product! thank awesome!  warm and lined.  love these just wish they could be cuffed even in 35&#34; i bought these for my 10 y.o. he usually wears a 12 slim - regular depending on the cut. i love the velcro bottoms, they will make the hem much easier to change!  these run a little small, so you may want to go up a size when ordering. these pjs are awesome. they are a bit big. i am 5ft 3in and weigh about 135lbs. they are a bit baggy and i need to roll the waisted band over once. that said, i am not returning them. they are super comfy and i love them. they came as expected, look great on and are exactly what she was hoping for.  as a parent, these pants have held up quite well. she still wears them and got them in august 2013.  i would recommend. they are good training pants and work well..just hard to find boys stuff around here and was glad to find them on line. delivered on time and was as described. fit great. nice lining. this far exceeded my expectations and the prices is unbelievable.  excellent buy!!! i bought this as a gift for my roommate for christmas. it came in perfect timing and is very soft, the size also fits perfect! i cannot tell you how many pieces of clothing i have bought online that do not fit right. it had become disheartening. but i just bought these pants hoping as they were billabong brand that they would be a better fit. and they are perfect! the material is great. the fit is perfect and they are so comfy and cute. thanks billabong. u r the bomb! thrilled with purchase good this is my second pair of these.  i have white and black now and both are excellent. they are stretchy but small and perfectly fit my little figure.  i wouldn\\'t reccomend these to someone who wears over size 4 unless you want your butt cheeks showing haha.  overall these are so perfect for anything you could want to do with them.  and the shipping is so fast.  both times they have arrived earlier than expected. great very nice fabric. my grand daughter loves them and more so cause they are red, soft and warm. great quality, very handsome pair of pants. purchased for my husband\\'s birthday, he is most happy with them.they are a perfect fit. my husband loves these for walking the dog on cold mornings. i love this outfit, it came in the mail quickly it did smell a little like gas but after 1 wash it was just fine, the headband looks and fits good too i love these pants however, i have very large calf muscles and they are pretty tight in the lower leg area. other than that these pants are very cute and flattering. the material is colorfast and soft too :) does exactly what it should - smuggle things where they are nestled securely.  hahahahaha.  always works past security. i bought these pajama bottoms for christmas.  it was the only thing she wanted.  the little bugger opened the gift before christmas because she wanted to wear them.  she loves them. love it and it\\'s so sexy...... the picture doesn\\'t do it justice. such a beautiful jumper. i recommend it highly. i normally wear a size 5 jean and i ordered a size 3, since the other reviews said to order one size smaller... and they fit great! they are a bit long but i still abolutely love them!! great fit and great material. they are very comfortable. i can\\'t believe how well these fit. i was nervous when i made the purchase and relied on other reviews. these are high enough that you don\\'t expose anything when bending over. the material is so breathable and snug yet not constricting or revealing. they\\'re long enough for heals and skinny enough for boots. they\\'re professional enough to wear in the office and comfortable enough to wear on the weekend. i\\'m 5\\'6&#34;, 120 lbs and small fit like it was tailor-made. this was a beautifully made product. my only suggestion to the seller is to make it available in tall as they do with other similar items they sell. that way i can actually wear it as a jumper too. i am 5\\'10 and i can in all honestly say these leggings are long enough with length to spare. not too much so they are dragging on the ground but being a tall woman and always struggling to find leggings long enough has been so problematic in the past so i did have some fear maybe someone measured wrong on the inseam. not so. i find the sizing true to size, a teeny bit larger than what i usually wear but i don\\'t like skin tight clothing in general. i wore these leggings casually 1 day, as in with my sneakers running errands, the next night i dressed them up with heels. casual or a more polished event and these leggings will fit the bill. i found them extremely comfortable and they had a nice breathability factor so even in the desert, at night, i wasn\\'t sweating while running errands or in a more high brow restaurant at night. being tall i am loving the fact that they are long enough for me! yay! i did receive these at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review and i am so glad i was offered that opportunity! fit as expected they fit wonderfully... my daughter wears them... bought them specifically for days she has gym class and also when we go to zumba or running.. so first off i am a married straight man and i bought these for me. it was a few years ago when it was laundry day or something and had to wear a pair of my wifes boy shorts and have not looked back! i love everything about them, the fit, the feel, the comfort. so over the years i have tried to find the perfect affordable  pair and i think i found them. for whatever reason trying to find mens spandex type underwear is either way over priced for the quality you receive or they are just way over priced. these seem very very well made and the fabric is fantastic but only time will tell. i dont understand why men have to wear uncomfortable underwear...mens boxer briefs are not at all made with a nice fabric and baxers bunch and your junk flops around...these are perfect!!! favorite pair size small is my usual size and fit is a little roomy as expected and desired for pajama bottoms. the material is a little stiff on arrival.  i have not worn or washed the pj bottoms to see if material will soften after washing, drying, and some fabric softener! got it because i\\'m in the first trimester of a pregnancy and somehow, anything with an elastic or zippered waist really really really bothered me!!! i was leary because of some of the reviews but i am very very happy i got them anyways!! i know the waist will become too small as my belly expend (they are not for maternity wear) but for now, they are super comfy, don\\'t dig into my belly at all, and i am considering getting two more small size, as i will wear these a lot after baby comes! i would even get the large now so i can still be comfy at home as baby grows, but i don\\'t want to pay what the company is asking for shipping ($8, sheesh!) once you select medium or large for size... fit perfectly.  i\\'m 5\\'7&#34; and the length was perfect.<br />they stretch slightly and are very soft.<br />washed up great. no shrinkage. washed in warm water.<br /><br />came back to purchase more and in more colors but they are out of my size!<br /><br />so sad! i like these and i wear them, the leg part is  a bit small  but they stretch well, so they\\'re good. they help.me think.about what i eat. i need that. i work at a zoo in chicago and often work outdoors. these leggings are perfect for layering under slacks for long, cold nights. they are incredibly comfortable and well made. i wear this garmet over my clothing to keep my lower body warm ridding my motorcycle in cold weather. it works great and for the price you can\\'t beat it great i\\'m 6\\'1&#34; and 190# and the x-large is good for the inseam. little baggy but a few washes will take care of that... i bought a pair of these pants from a local second hand story, size 34 waist, 30 length. they had me looking like a grape smuggler who was walking into an impending flash flood (i am 34x34 size). so i made some friggin lemonade. i cut the bottom half off of the pants and now these pups are rugged high golf fashion. i play a fair share of golf each summer and with these customized shorts on, i always raise eyebrows.<br /><br />i exclaim \\\\\\\\\"yeah there sansabelt custom golf shorts\\\\\\\\\" its all the fun of shorts without the annoying seams at the base of the short leg. and did i mention the pattern? must be something rare because i can\\'t see any proof on google. they are solid navy blue with crossing red and white pin stripes.<br /><br />one drawback, the front pockets are small and snug. if you are ordering as a legit 34, i\\'d suggest going up to either 35 or 36 for the waist. regarding the length, i\\'m not sure it matters because you\\'ll be cutting most of that fabric off. nice product and came as desribed in ad - would buy again. we purchased these fleece pants as a gift for my husband\\'s grandmother because she wanted them.  they fit great and are the color she was looking for.  we looked for these in the stores, but were unsuccessful.  great and unexpected to find them on amazon! i love the bamboo fabric for babies.  it is super soft and breathes really well.  it\\'s a tad expensive, but worth the cost. these sat a bit farther down from my navel than i would have liked; had to return them.  otherwise they seemed well-constructed, just not the right fit for my body. used as gift very soft and good quality i guess i wasnt sure what to expect. but i love them! i put them on to try them when they arrived, and didnt take them off! so comfortable. and colors exactly as pictured. i bought these pants for yoga class, but i paired them with a short denim vest, white tank top, strappy high heel sandals and some gypsy earrings for a trendy looking outfit. they were just what i expected and fit well. my daughter wore this outfit at holloween. she is a size 4 juniors and this fits her like a glove. excellant quality! so comfortable an sweet. happy with my purchase. its a beautiul pants and fit as expected. really love it. i recomend great product, received quickly... very happy. excellent fit. really comfortable.  love them. love it! great fit. very nice and confortable i think they are great! as advertised, they are thick cotton. i was really tired of thin yoga pants. this is the second pair i have purchased. i am a petite small. i purchased the small size first and the medium second. after washing in cold water, i let them line dry. the medium is not that much different maybe a tad more room in the legs. i did have to hem them, but no big deal.  i like the privacy the thick cotton offers and they look good on. i would purchase them again and certainly recommend them. i love these pants they are comfortable and so far have held up well.  the length is great.  they are actually a little long which is the way i like to wear my pants. i have a little a 35\\\\\\\\\" inseam which is between the normal 34\\\\\\\\\" and the long which usually runs 36\\\\\\\\\". made well i don\\'t think there was any butt lifting action going on with these pants, they are nice quality however. true to size, but not as flattering as they were made out to be. i wouldn\\'t pay close to $50 again for another pair... they were a gift and she loved them! good quality i ordered the wrong size and you traded with no problems. my husband likes the style, fit and wear. since he is 6\\'5&#34; it is rare to find all three i love these! and let me tell ya, i have ordered a ton of yoga pants! i am about 101lbs and i am about 5\\'7, they are long but i wear them with running shoes and they fit perfectly! and i have no butt! but these pants really help to show off the little butt i do have! they are super nice and i get lots of compliments! plus they are not see-thru which helps a lot for the active person but yet they are super comfortable! i give an a+!! these pants are comfortable, i would definitely buy another one! they are a bit overpriced, but i guess it\\'s worth it lol i like them.  they are so comfortable.  just a little too long. this shorts rocks,,, could be cheaper tho :) i am a size us6. these fit perfectly. have some room but just sinch the waist. they are very comfortable and very cute. i was asked where i got them. :) they are mostly opaque. with really bright light behind me, you were able to see a bit through them.<br />great buy! i bought 4 of these pants before my baby was born. she ended up being smaller than what i expected, but the 0-3 fit just great at the waist just had to roll the length up. i absolutely love them. i use them a lot, because they are soft (no waistband) and not too warm for the hot days. to me they have been pretty practical and easy to combine. love all the colors, even though i just got purple, yellow, gray and white. i want to get all of them! high quality. i would buy from this seller again. they resolve concerns promptly and to great satisfaction. they are somewhat smaller than expected. be sure to order one or two sizes larger than usual. as expected great pants. love the flared bottom of the legs. they are so comfortable and really stretchy. it comes really long for my 5\\'4&#34; so i had them shortened. the stone wash look is nice. i can wear them for sport or just around town or? i am a size 12 and the large was fine. my daughter got them too. she is a size 4-6 and the small fit her too. nice price here on amazon. absolutely love theses pants! they are the most comfortable. and look great on! i love these pants. they are really soft inside and are perfect for lounging around. after i wore them for awhile i decided to buy a second pair so that i would never have to be without them. they are just perfect. i live in texas where it can get pretty hot in the summer, but i still wear them year-round. super cute and not pricey! i love them. they are thick sweats so not summer wear but i would recommend them for fall/winter! pocket zipper is weird so i wouldn\\'t put anything in the pockets but overall love them. these work well, but not very thick. these are a great price and extremely comfortable. i don\\'t think they are the best quality but i love the fit and feel of these pants. i would recommend these for people looking for lounging pant and inexpensive yoga pants. as a mom who is not a fan of onsies, i am always very happy to find pants for my 4 month old! these are really cute and have held up after several washings - they run a little bit big, which is a good thing for sure. he appears to be very comfortable in them and he looks adorable. i love these pants.  i have already worn them several times and the variations in the purple aqua make them easy to co-ordinate with different tops.  i always get compliments when i wear them and people ask where i got them.  they dry quickly so they are perfect for the beach.  all-around great pants. these pants were a great color and fit comfortably.  i can wear jeans to work and the color and fit allow for more outfit varieties and comfort.  was happy with shipping and price. i bought these as an alternative to tripp pants since they were cheaper. the fit is not what i expected it to be, but i can still wear them, despite the pants being a little tight in the rear. i\\'m not too much of a fan of the material though. i expected the material to be closer to the style of tripp, but it\\'s all polyester and no cotton. i do love the mesh pocket\\'s at the side and of course i love the wide-legs.<br /><br />thanks everyone and have a blessed day great pants, super cute! the only downside is they don\\'t hold their color very well. i bought it for my christmas travel, it was pretty and comfortable. lightweight and perfect for hot summers in tucson. and it has pockets! was surprised that it did not have an actual hem, simply cut material, but it has held up through repeated machine washings, so that has not become an issue. comfortable. excellent item i was worried about de size, but it was just like i expected. i loved the fabric. it is very comfortable the shorts provide some hold, but i bought them mainly as precautionary cover for dresses that fly up on windy days.  comfortable and nonbonding/pinching. beautifully made. the colors were vibrant!  unlike the bonzaai patchwork harem pants which i ordered and received radically different product from the display image,this product/vendor and the image was spot on! of course, there is variation of the patterns- but, bright and colorful! i am 5\\'5&#34; with &#34;boy&#34; hips and very fit. the legs were too short- mid calf! sadly, i returned them. i was surprised by the comfort of these scrubs. they fit really well and let you be flexible. i now have two pairs of these.  i wear them under my jeans in the cold winter months.  they are not too think or thin and the lining is oh so soft! these pants are amazing. the are really comfortable for work and i love how fast shipping is. never have to worry about getting more fast if i need them in a hurry these are great! comfy and very pretty very comfortable for everyday living un buen producto, el cual recomendaria, prenda en buen estado, y colores segun la solicitud emitida, gracias por el excelente servicio. cute color, very soft like a t-shirt and very comfortable. they are too cute. they\\'re pretty warm and much like any legging, you have to wear the right underwear. i\\'m 5\\'7&#34; and 180lbs, size 14 and they are not see through on me. they fit great! i can\\'t wait for it to get a little colder so i can wear them. my husband loves these pj pants. he is 6\\'4&#34; with a medium build, so i bought him the xl size. they are a bit drapey around his feet like in the photo.  maybe not quite as much as the photo.  he likes that they are long like that. he says that they are super comfortable. these are super cute bloomers.  they are perfect for under dresses and such.  they are well made and fit my 9 1/2 month well still after a few months. over here in kentucky we dont see things like this often so, when i ordered them i anticipated the delivery, as it would take longer than 3 -5 days i was used to, but i received faster than the shipping time said which is good and they are not only comfortable but very stylish and sexy. thanks for my black lace-up pants. very pretty. very nice colors are bright as expected perfect fit too excited to wear them this coming weekend. super comfy and well made. love it and got the blue pair as well. these are the best for the time between diapers and fully trusting your little one to make it to the potty. these helped my daughter feel the sensation of getting wet but held enough liquid that the mess was minimized. they are by no means leak proof but they are quite helpful. pants runs true to their size and has a little stretch. they look just like the online photo and they\\'re not bad for the price. i needed new scrubs because i had recent weight loss and my old ones looked baggy on me.  my mom got me 1 set of these from  my wishlist.  i do agree with a previous person that they are a little stiff (but i\\'ve had worse!) but that\\'s because they\\'re thicker than normal cheap scrubs, which means they\\'ll last longer!  i love the look of them, and they fit well!  i need more scrubs and i have plans to purchase 4 more different color sets of them! these are very nice sweat pants, soft stretchy and a nice feminine fit.  i would have liked them to be thicker and warmer, like a pair of zella sweats that i love (which they don\\'t make anymore).  these are fairly thin light fabric pants fairly form fitting.  nice long length as well. love them, i want to buy more! to sexy for  my  wife  but  i  love it on  her shes  the best  looking thing  in my  life  will buy  again  sexy  as hell came quick and fitted as expected these pants will keep you warm; i\\'ve used them outside at night for hours under ontario\\'s december moons.  never had to add long underwear, but you could if you wanted to go truly arctic.  minor quibble, pants ride a little high.  otherwise, perfecto, and come out of the wash looking dry-cleaned. the image on the pants is a lil distorted but they are fun. they arrived way before time and they look extremely nice, anyone who wants to buy needs to check the sizes always. all in all, they\\'re great. i love these pants so much!!!!!!! they are comfortable and cute and make my butt look great! lol definitely recommend them! i wasn\\'t sure about the fit, as i am very tall with a long torso, but these are the best maternity pants ever! slimming in the leg and very very comfortable fit. i wear them both professionally and casually. a great buy! nice shorts fits perfectly when i ordered it, i was very skeptical about how it will fit me and materials good or bad how they are made. but i\\'m so glad i have ordered it and it fits perfectly and so far so good for using it for my exercise. i\\'ll recomend this product and will buy it again in the future if i need another one. hopefully will be a smaller size. ;-) these pants are awesome. they are nice and snug in all of the places you want them to be. i feel svelte when i wear them, and considering how cheap they are, i am seriously impressed. i typically get my clothes at torrid, where you can spend up to $80 on a pair of pants, that are decent at best. these pants are awesome, and a total steal. i\\'m going to buy a couple more pairs.... in my opinion, otomix workout pants are perhaps the best i\\'ve used, being thin and high quality. unfortunately, i\\'m not sure i want to have too many pants with all of those funky designs. i think that they should also make more simple solid-color ones. i had been looking around at all the more expensive brands hoping to get a good quality training pant that would be comfortable, not leak, and hold up in the wash.  thank you to the reviewer who said these are a superior product to another brand that was more expensive!  i can\\'t believe how soft they are.  my son is starting potty training, so he doesn\\'t have very much control yet and they hold a heck of a lot of pee and haven\\'t leaked yet.  i\\'m sure if a kid emptied his entire bladder they would go through, but if they get the idea that they\\'re not supposed to \\\\\\\\\"go\\\\\\\\\" in them and they have accidents still, these are perfect.    my son is 22 months, in the 99% percentile on height & weight and wears 2t pants (most brands are too tight but the length is right) and 3t shirts.  so he is a kid of substance.  i decided to get the 3t training pants since everyone said they run small, but i wish i would have gone smaller because they kind of sag after he\\'s ran around in them for awhile.  i guess it makes them easier to pull off and on.  they are a really cute cut, more of a boxer brief than a brief.    finally, a gerber product i like!  i\\'m a picky mom and these are great. these are perfect!! u can wear these to bed, gym, lounge in or to the store!! betcha i\\'ll do all, they are comfy & they fit as i wished!! the color is perfect & i will enjoy them til they fall off or fall apart & buy new ones!! i also want many other colors too!! i had to return it because the size was too fit it was really great quality. ok here\\'s the low down: i\\'m 5\\'8&#34;, very slim, 120lbs with no curves whatsoever. they are thin, but soft. they are long enough, coming down to my socks and the one size fits all probably does. if they fit me and i\\'m tiny, i\\'m sure someone bigger than me will be able to fit them. good purchase for the price and they arrived in 2 days! i purchased these as a gift and glad i did. he loves these pants because they are a great fit and very comfortable. this is the second pair of clothing i own by this manufacturer.  the pants are comfortable to wear and roomy.  not really cool to wear on a hot day.  there seems to be a double layer of nylon that traps your body heat in the air pockets, but hey who wants to wear pants on a hot day, right? i am 5\\'6, 130lbs. suit is nice, well made,looks mature and very business like.  however size 4 is big and size 2 too small to accommodate my butt comfortably. so,  suit looks good but not totally great fit on me. great fit i love the top.  the pants fit somewhat weird but they are cute.  the handkerchief was useless for my child.  she doesn\\'t like anything on her head. these were awesome... i was a bit envious when i saw these compared to the pricer ones i purchased for myself. my husband has been snowmobiling and skiing in these and said they were really comfortable - warm and dry. these are nicely lined and constructed well. he was able to move around in them quite well - they weren\\'t stiff or binding at all. the quality on these was much better than we expected for the price. the fit was true to size and the length great (xl fit my 260 lb 6\\'2\\\\\\\\\" hubby). they also washed quite well. my gf loves it. perfect match with the avengers bra. geekly recommended! wow arrived early, what a big surprise, we are going out saturday night so she can wear it afterward, so excited to see her in it all very well although it is a bit small, as my daughter is thin and wears size 4, she loves it, the fabric is soft and the colors remain after washing i purchased these pants a size down form my usual as suggested for more &#34;control&#34;.  they are slimming and smoothing.  and the waistband does not roll!  however, i would have like a few more inches on the waist height.  i found myself tugging on the back side all day fearing an exposure.  if you are short-waisted girls (as i am), beware of the coverage.  overall i like them enough to order another color. great pants, delivery time ok but nothing to rave about. they fit my elderly mom fine, but for petites, they are too long.  my mom has lots of other pants by national, and all the petites are fine in length.  not these.  otherwise, very soft, nice fabric and they fit everywhere else. these come longer and baggier than you might think.  order one size smaller than you usually might. these shorts are more for wearing as an under garment. my daughter plays volleyball and wears these under her shorts. the pants fit well and i like that they are long enough for me. love these pant! i like my clothes big for my baby to grown so they fit just how i would of liked them too. she is one month old and she definitely has room for growth but they fit cute! makes your bum... amazing. the only problem is witch i didn\\'t know was lace all the way up the front so you would need to wear a long chiffon blouse. arrived faster than expected, 3 days to ohio. i wear a size 12 in women\\'s, these pants were perfect. i am 5\\' x 5&#34; tall. they hang just below my ankles. they are lovely, comfortable, and seem to be very well made. perfect for a summer day, and comfortable enough to sleep in. if you are like me and love nydj,  you will love their velvet trouser jeans/pants.  they are made of the same 4% spandex 96% cotton but have a soft butter wash and feel wonderful.  two coin pockets in the front and two back faux welt pockets.  front zip fly with tab button close. bootcut / slight flare, classic rise - perfect for special occassions .... no one but you will know they are actually comfortable tummy tuck not your daughter\\'s jeans as they look like expensive dress velvet pants but still have all the classic elements of nydj we all love! my daughter bought these for my for christmas and i love them.  super soft, fuzzy and comfy!! beautiful material and did not have any spots, or bad fabric. i am pleased with the product. only down side is it fit way too small. i am a short, thin-curvy person, but it definitely isn\\'t made for curvy girls. the back does not cover the complete area at all. i am using this product for a festival and although i want to look sexy, i do not want to pass as vulgar. i am going to have to buy shorts to wear under to cover the area completely. the front did fit perfect, though. the waistline looks good, and as i said, the design and color of this product is beautiful. so i will wear it anyway. (get a bigger size than you are) this was a gift for my son who wanted them for skiing. he used them the day after christmas & was very pleased with both the fit & the light weight. i like these pajamas very much! great fit. not too baggy, yet comfortable. fleece is soft and the print is fun. the un9 cotton long john fits great.  the only issue i have is that the material is extremely thin and the seat split the first time that i wore them.  i\\'m sure they can be sewn up and be fine.  despite this little issue, i still like them.  these long johns are extremely comfortable under my jeans and would recommend them to anyone. great fit! although these pants are pretty awesome there were two little things off, but one easy to fix and the other a happy surprise. these are not brown, they are more of a deep olive green, which made me very happy. the other issue is that it states the waist stretches up to 51 inches. i don\\'t know if anyone else had a problem with this, but the waist definitely did not stretch past 30 inches. instead of getting peeved or complaining, i examined the pants a little and with a few snips and resews i took out the elastic band and replaced it with a long string to tie. this way i can adjust the waist as needed. the waist without the elastic is huge, way past 51 inches, so it is possible to easily alter these to fit you. you can also just get a longer piece of elastic if you prefer, i just used the string because i already had it. other than that i love the color they feel really nice on the skin and are totally comfy. they look nice enough to dress up or just throw a t-shirt on and you\\'re ready to go. we\\'ll see how they hold up in the wash! its fit well .nice color and fit as they way i wanted it to be.dont worry about buying this pant , its really nice i really like the fabric. washes and drys nicely. stays wrinkle free while wearing. nice color selection. lots of fun! i bought these and wore them to an \\'80s event one night with a short halter top and some ankle biker boots. i got a lot of compliments. i also wear them around the house as weekend pants or to yoga class sometimes. they\\'re pretty amazing. strechy and comfortable. color is good love this look and i\\'d get more colors. also, the company gave me a 10% off coupon. how great is that?! these pants are lovely and fall wonderfully in the draped fashion of harem pants. i\\'m only returning them because they fit too tightly in the derri&egrave;re. i\\'m 5\\'7 and currently weigh 143lbs. i ordered a size large. my only other criticism is the material is a little thin. beautiful silky feel. love the cuffs love it, looks great on. nice pants. love the sweatpants.  they\\'re very comfy, but the men\\'s small is still a bit too large for me.  otherwise, very nice. comfortable. great fit. good for the gym or house. this=are=the=best-pants36x32 great received at a timely matter. fast delivery. pants fit good just a little small, my advice is order another size up what you always wear. it\\'s a little tight. i work outside in what\\'s getting to be 30 degree weather, and these pants have kept me comfortable. i don\\'t ski or do any other rigorous activity in them, so i can\\'t vouch for there durability. like others have said, the draw string doesn\\'t hold its tension, unless you\\'re willing to tie a potentially difficult to undo knot. otherwise, i\\'m happy over all. nice as described fit really good good fit, good material, good buy. autobots...roll out!! i of course had no idea how they would fit or how the material would feel. but these are perfect hang around home / pajama pants.  nothing fancy. i\\'m a big fan of merino wool, so i got these for my kid when we go skiing. i love thin layers that can keep you warm! ordered 1 size bigger than usual as per another review i read and they fit great. a little thin material. great pants for the bargain. quilty product, very comfortable, i feel like they will last forever. i would order from this seller again,thank you! i purchased this for my two year old granddaughter and she loved it. i have a close friend that likes yoga and one day she was wearing a pait of cotton harem pants. i loved how they fit her and she said that she got them from amazon. now i have my own. bought these for my wife to get her away from el cheapo yoga pants. they fit nice and look great on her. hard to find size my son and i thank you for having small and long sizes cause wish came in more variety of colors, more style choices, cheaper, and came with more in a pack and looked nicer. the quality of these pants is better than i had expected.  i\\'m surprised that the decepticon logo has held up through all the washings.  very recommended. very nice product.  you can wear them, wash them and then dry, and no wrinkles.  i\\'m pleased. i really love the design but it is very tight around the legs. much tighter than your average soccer pants. great quality. gold puma is awesome. its just great and comfortable thank you fits well. very comfortsble. i love these pants because they are flattering on a women\\'s body. the only complaint is they are really big. i am usually a size 10 and ordered the medium. they are so big i don\\'t even have to unbutton them to take them off. i have to keep retying the drawstring to keep them tight. i am going to order another pair in size small. i can\\'t imagine the small fitting my big behind, but we will see!  these pants are very comfortable! way better than the men\\'s camo pants i usually wear. we wear camo to paint in. got these on an impulse buy. they look cool and fit well. the only minor complaint i have is that the fabric is fairly thin so not very warm on winter nights. other than that i have no issues and i\\'m glad i bought them. my husband liked the fit and material of these pants for his costume. this is my first order of yoga pants on amazon, i usually buy them elsewhere so that i can try them on. these fit great on me, i\\'m 5\\'10&#34;, 140 lb. the fabric is of decent quality, i don\\'t feel like i\\'m wearing pj\\'s out in public. if you\\'re tall ( 5\\' 8&#34; +) they will fit you great, for shorter women not so much. i purchased a large and am glad i did, i don\\'t like my pants to be too tight for exercise, walking, etc. get a larger size to prevent pilling if you\\'re concerned about this - caused by thighs rubbing together. it also depends upon what type of shoes you want to wear with them as in heel height. consider this before ordering & you\\'ll be more likely to get the right size for your height/weight.<br /><br /> note: the cuffs on the legs are finished so they would be a pain to alter unless done professionally or if you have great sewing skills. these pants are sleek looking (slimming), with a more &#34;matte&#34; than shiny finish (my preference!) and can be dressed up or down depending upon the occasion. they do not attract as much pet hair as others i own....i\\'ve never found any black yoga pants that didn\\'t attract hair except spandex which is not a fabric i care for. i think these pants are a great deal for the money, and are comparable in quality with those i\\'ve purchased from sporting goods stores or places like rei for much more money. i only wish this company offered more colors! looks like genuine usgi to me. good enough for government work. i bought these tights to wear under short dresses. they aren\\'t see through and they are comfy. i wore them while i was doing a lot of walking back and forth and they were ok, just a little hot. i am 5\\'10\\\\\\\\\" 175lbs and i bought a large. they fit well and were long enough. awesome material and very comfy these were exactly what she was looking for.  the print is exactly as pictured.  the fabric is very soft and of course will not wrinkle so very good for packing.  it runs a bit smaller than anticipated but stretches.  if you want a looser look get a size up. love this! was everything i expected. i cannot stop wearing them lol. i need more of these. man, these would be so awesome in warm weather so light and cool. i wear em casually with jandals or out to dinner with the girls just throw a blazer over em and cute pumps and bob\\'s your uncle lol! i\\'m going to order more as summer over here in australia is fast approaching=) order actual size. fits as expected it is a gift for christmas, so i dont know if it fits her yet. however, i was pleased with the quick shipment and the pjs were cute.<br />crossing my fingers they fit her and suit her. i love these pants. i\\'m an avid workout fiend, about 2-3 hours a day.  they hold up so well i bought 3. fit me very well with a medium size and i\\'m 6\\' 155lbs. !:) good love my new yoga pants.  fit great and i didn\\'t have to hem them! very comfy! gortex. inexpensive.  good delivery.  thanks. it is excellent yes a bit large but hey nothing wrong with it. arrived before estimated date i love these pants.  just know that the material is heavy.  probably not something you will wear in the summer.  works well with a darker sport coat or a sweater. these are the best pants i\\'ve ever owned. so comfy....perfect for a die-hard soa fan. love love love them if you want to wear in a skirt and like sittingor to lie on the ground,this is the best choice. good price, perfect fit. excellent product. very soft! solid quality. kind of baggy. nice looking and comfortable pants. cute just did not fit absolutely love these fit great i bought two more!! comfy jammies. nice and thick. the stitching on the bottom of the feet isn\\'t grippy at all, and the jammies are so slippery to wear that we usually put grippy slippers or socks with grippers on top of the pajamas except while sleeping. putting on these pants is like putting on a party.<br />they make you want to dance and laugh.<br />very well made, though too high waisted for short people, and too short for tall people.<br />still, great for leisure, exercise, sleep, and parties. worth the price! i want more! perfect jazz pants for my daughter, they are shiney which she didn\\'t care for but thats just personal preference. amazon sadly has a very poor customer service practices. i ordered something for someone and then months later amazon charged something to their credit card without any authorization using my name and billing information, when i called to have the charge credited, they did credit it but cancelled my prime membership telling me that they have no way of reinstating the month that was left on it, plain out ignorant and unacceptable especially with good customers who spend a lot of money on a daily basis nice fabric, but on the small side lovely trousers and definitely softer in the waist band than others i\\'ve tried. i had bought them for work thinking the were wide leg black pants which they are... however they are 2layered, the top being chiffon. i must have missed it in the details but for me they are lovely but not an everyday pair of pants. super comfortable,  but a little thin. i am glad i ordered a longer top to go with them. but, they are really colorful and vibrant! super comfy and very versatile. normally i wear a large and this fit well with tons of space. cant wait to get more colors. cute but snug. order up. they are very for fitting. not loose at butt, hips these pants fit awesome on my 10 week old daughter , she wear them everyday.  i will buy another set. i\\'m 5 foot, 4.5 inches tall.  i normally wear a size 6 in bottoms.  i ordered the the bottoms of these leggings come 3 or 4 inches above the ankle.  now, this is exactly how they are shown on the model, but i thought they would be longer on me since i\\'m not very tall.  so, i would recommend these, but caution you to be aware of the length.  they might be more like capris if you\\'re tall. love, love, love!!! if i could afford to buy a pair in every color i would!!! the only criticism i have is that i may have to secure the buttons with a little bit additional thread, but love how they fit and feel-fun pants and simply beautiful! feels comfy works great and love the fit will probably order more, as i gave it to my sister and she loved it. didn\\'t read the information well enough so i didn\\'t realize these were spandex pants. when they came in the mail i was having a really bad day and had a really good laugh. shrink in dryer most comfortable pants ever these are really nice, fit me perfectly; fabric is good.  i went back and ordered another pair.  lots of color choices...very satisfied with this purchase. i love this. it does wrinkle however extremely versatile and well made. not only are they great and stand up to the rough conditions i put the pants through.  the pants don\\'t stain as easily and i was very pleasantly surprised to find my pants were already pre-ironed with the mid-line seam down the pants when i got them.  it\\'s not that often you find pants like that. wanted a velour track suit for around the house and/or gym.  dept store prices were astronomical with jacket and pants priced separately.  cordiu very inexpensive, very comfortaable, as good looking at $200 models. these pants are amazing, i have like 10 pairs and cant/wont stop buying them, also this is a good price for this brand, normally theyre more expensive than they are on here. fits like a glove going by the online size chart, we measured my wife and bam!  she\\'s thrilled with them and so am i. that\\'s right, pockets! these are wonderfully comfy lounge pants. thin, but nice enough to be warm on a night with a slight chill. soft and my new favorite to wear! very comfortable to wear and like the style. he loves them!! better than expected fits as promised well constructed,very comfortable material, plenty of room for doing squats, have and will purchase more from crazee wear in future. was delivered as promised good fit, made by hanes, no draw string elastic band, made by hanes the actual  bacon thing is just an iron on super cute but were a bit too small on me.  i gave them to my niece.  if i order any in the future, i will be ordering up a size or two. my toddler loves these coveralls so much that they\\'re practically her weekend uniform.  (i bought them in the yellow dots design, which is no longer available).  the bamboo viscose material is super-soft and very stretchy, so it moves easily with her when she\\'s active (which is pretty much all the time when she\\'s awake!).  these coveralls are very versatile because the bamboo viscose material is great for temperature regulation.  it keeps my little-one from getting too hot when she\\'s running around & playing, and prevents her from getting too cold when temperatures cool off.  these playsuits are plenty warm enough for us during winters in southern california, but i probably wouldn\\'t recommend them for very cold winter weather.  although they do have long sleeves, the pant-legs don\\'t extend all the way to the ankles (they\\'re capri-length), so your child\\'s legs will probably get cold unless they\\'re wearing very tall socks, leg-warmers or tights.  plus, the material is pretty thin and lightweight, so it probably won\\'t protect your little-one from bitter-cold temperatures unless other clothing is layered over it.<br /><br />for our purposes, however, these coveralls are perfect!<br /><br />grade: a i can\\'t say enough about this! soooo cute!! it looks like its made for a adult but shrunk. i love the soft material! i can\\'t wait to see the baby in it. bought these for my adult son. well fitting, very soft lounge pants. happy with product. my daughter is 110# and 5\\'4&#34;.  we tried a 3 and 5 and sent them back.  the 7 fits.  they are better pants in my opinion than dickies.  the waistband is slightly low rise and has a nice, thick band.  soft fabric and the color is typical khaki. great seller,fast shipping.only thing to mention would be i am 5\\'4&#34; and although i expected the large to be a little long they are very long and i should have went with a medium.but that is my fault not the sellers.just thought i should mention is so others have a way to gage what the length would be for them. great fit, but see through! the best pants i ever had! they are soft and easy to wash and fit very well. it\\'s hard to find anything bad about these pants for the price - i didn\\'t like how there wasn\\'t much of a pant leg draw string and the large fit big on my. i\\'m 6, 2&#34;, and 190 lbs. nice very nice leggins i am 6 ft, 160 lbs and bought a medium. looking back, i should have bought a large. they are very comfortable and warm. more functional than the n2n classic long john. warmer too. keep in mind they are low-rise. the legs like to creep up, i tuck them into socks to stop this. the classic are more comfortable and sexier. but the rr1 are definitely warmer. i have both and am very happy with the n2n products. comfortable material not quite a jeggin material so im happy with the jean feel i would have ordered a medium next time, but that was my own mistake! i think they are highly fashionable and i cannot wait until i strut these out! as expected wife says it fits perfectly, she enjoys the sweat when she works out my wife said they were to small by tried them on fit just right awesome fit i wore this to a spongebob themed party and it was a big hit. the quality of the shirt is outstanding and didn\\'t shrink when it washed. too short. otherwise fits perfectly. my one and only real gripe is that the coloring did not match what was seen on my browser. the pants that arrived were more of a dark forest tricolor. i was looking for some nice white/grey/black tricolor, but i got evergreen/brown/black.<br /><br />with that out of the way, they\\'re very nice. they don\\'t bag out as badly as a lot of other fatigue pants tend to. they\\'re warm, durable, and comfortable. they\\'re great for working on the car, chopping wood, and even hunting (since they are, in fact, woods colored).<br /><br />the digital pattern looks pretty sharp as well. the button fly i could do without. i wore these for a weekend of camping with buddies where a couple beers were had. by the end of the night, the exercise of a button fly made me wonder why people hadn\\'t thought to make zippers sooner. love it!! i will be getting more in different colors!  very long so i dont have to worry about it shrinking in the wash/dryer. super happy super soft. great for yoga!! perfect sweatpant, lots of room great for doing quick stuff outside with the cuffed bottom. love them. i absolutely adore this pants. they are so comfortable and can be worn either as a dressy look or casually. i am about 5\\'6&#34; and 140-145 lbs. they fit well, and look exactly like the product image suggests. i am happy with this product. i ordered a few items from this seller at one time, and they arrived together in less than two days, faster than i expected. my future son-in-law loves these! everybody asked me about my new grey jeans... but it\\'s all just a photo of jeans on very comfortable opaque leggings. they have stretched out a bit so they feel a little more loose than leggings usually do. but they work with so many different colors. i get a lot of compliments on them. i love these. i\\'ve worn them a few times out to bars and get compliments on them. they make my legs look amazing.  some leggings cut into you but the high waist makes these so comfy.  it\\'s a little hot for them now but will definitely use again in winter. product was exactly as described and at a great price and very fast delivery !!! will be back to this sellers page !!! these seem to be great for the low, low price of $12.97.  i took a chance and ordered two pairs and am glad i did.  for a 32\\\\\\\\\" waist, the medium fits fine (on the loose side).  the inseam is a little longer than 32\\\\\\\\\" so they hang a bit long on me, but will be great for when wearing hiking boots.  the fit is baggy and comfortable.    as the other review notes, the belt is barely functional and should not be counted upon.  that was fine with me, i was buying pants, not a belt.      one nice feature that wasn\\'t mentioned in the description is that they have 10\\\\\\\\\" boot zips up the side so that you can easily remove them over boots.    the quality seems to be comparable to other pants of this ilk that i\\'ve seen.  i see no loose stitching or other issues.  zippers are ykk and are well-sewn.  i\\'m not the biggest fan of the snap waist closure, but for the price, i can live with it!  even if they wear our twice as fast (and i\\'m not convinced that\\'ll be the case), these pants are a great deal. i like these pants but the waist is really high and the sizing is hard to figure out. but they are perfect for atving! fits very nice. i really like it.would love to have different colors. it\\'s perfect for me. it is good that feel soft. spongebob print is cuuuute.  i can put enough pen. amazing fit, wonderful quality. first thing i did when opening package i put these beauties on! super comfortable. you can dress item up or down. wear to work; in any field, and go out for drinks or out to enjoy the night life. also a wonderful lounge pant. flattering on any figure. wear as high waisted or fold down for \\'normal\\' wear. note that fabric is spandex and ryon, any clothing made with these materials with the incorrect fit can be opaque, however i do not have this problem. having a smidge extra to love on my beautiful body this pant does not grib your extra to love, but flaunts it wonderfully! so in love with this item. now to try out other thanth products. as well as hunt down this style in cotton or linen!!!! cute little pants in vibrant colors and nice material- loved it these are awesome! i got the small size and they are so comfortable, so soft, and my boyfriend said i need to get more lol. i\\'d say these are a wonderful choice! good fit. nice buy comfortable to wear, it is worth buying. color was almost the same as picture. very nice piece.definitely would recommend. i mean can\\'t really complain or be excited about the pants since they are just yoga pants. i was happy with the quality and how comfortable they are because they fit really well and were perfect for cosplaying, walking around, and doing yoga. they\\'re pretty nice quality, held together well, and were relatively inexpensive. super comfy, ordered one size bigger and fits perfectly. softest, most wonderful jammies around! i always have issues finding yoga pants that are long enough for me, and these are perfect! not long enough to trip on, but touches the floor in back, and covered half of my foot in front. the description says the model was in medium, and that\\'s about right. i\\'m 5\\'7, 130lb, and they are appropriately tight on my thighs. material feels great, the build seems sturdy, but i just got them. i wear yoga pants at work, so i will update once these have been put through the paces. the coral color is nice, the mint is a little darker than expected, but no complaints here. will almost definitely order more colors. the color os brighter in person than in the official picture which is great! beautiful color! lace is strong and good quality so no worries about ot breaking or anything. the strings make this very customizable as far as sizing. i am 5\\'3&#34; and it fit perfectly height wise too. lace was not too long for my torso. butt coverage was perfect, altho the middle is ruched so it gives a wrinkled crack look...i dont know how to describe it better... still super cute and got a lot of compliments! the top is a little close together though and i had to spend a bit of time adjusting it. i love the way these feel...i dont wear panties with them and they feel amazing on my shaft.....instant erection....very sexy great buy--i used these during a hot summer while pregnant. very thin cotton, lots of bands of elastic, so i felt a little supported at my low belly. they stay up by my knees or low on my calf, since there is elastic at the bottom of the legs too. i still slip them on in spring/simmer weather or just around the house. i always get compliments when i wear these. the pockets are useful, though i don\\'t rely on them since i feel whatever is in them on my legs. the color does fade on these, so maybe i\\'ll do a rit dye treatment. my daughter absolutely loved these!!!  her friends gave her lots of compliments and her &#34;swag was on 10&#34;.  love them super soft and comfy! these are so comfortable!! usually yoga pants are too long on me, but these weren\\'t bad at all.  they fit perfectly at the waist and are very flattering, too.  too bad they are out of stock in my size or i would order more. nice pants southpole pants are always so cheap and so comfortable! they fit me great, and i have very wide hips. they stretch comfortably and still sit snugly at my waist despite having 12&#34; difference between my waist and hips. have yet to try on it. but i buy big room to grow rather to little. ;) so comfortable ... fit was as i expected.  these are my favorite pants to relax in. this is the first time my daughter said she liked anything i picked out for her. she was expecting something &#34;dorky&#34;. i received the alfred dunner plus size pull-on pants today and they fit perfectly.  i love the gray color i picked, it was perfect for what i needed.  thank you. i bought this as a gift for someone and he absolutely loved it.  only con was that the chains did not unhook from both ends.  he ended up cutting some of the chains off.  not sure how they expect you to wash the pants with those big chains on them. unlike some of the other reviews here stating that they are too tight and too skinny. it was the complete opposite for me they are a bit baggy and not tight enough around the calves, and legs. maybe it was the possibility of ordering a size too big since even though i\\'m certain of my pants size. overall great pants for what i\\'m using them for. my only recommendation is perhaps getting them a size or two smaller than your usual. these were gift from my daughter. she guessed correctly at the xxl. i am a shortwaisted 18 womens with a tummy and no butt. they come all the way up to my waist with no sagging. i like how the knees snap back even after sitting and typing all day. i am ordering more. i was surprised that the pants fit rather snug.  all of my pants are 36 waist and do not fit so snug.  i am not going to return the pants and the quality of the material and workmanship is excellent.  i am please overall with my purchase. true to size and deep, practical pockets. i like the khaki especially (got black too).. because the look isn\\'t too \\'military\\' for civilian work. they are low-rise, which is not very comfortable for a lounge pant. but i kept them anyway because it\\'s so hard to find leopard print anything. they are very soft and cozy and seem to be very well made. i like these pajamas.  they are very comfortable and wash and dry well.  the price was excellent.  just wish they wouldn\\'t get little fuzz balls on them that i have to whisk off with my sweater de-fuzzer. this is a great product, but is way too large. returning and ordered smaller size. they fit like a glove....just love them.  i am thinking about buying another pair. tnis is hard to find in stores with tjis blend of fabric and these are what i ha e worn for 15 years as work pants. no fading love tnese these are perfect to wear as an extra protection under my gym shorts that tend to ride a little too high during certain exercises. i know being one size fits most that it is concerning to some, hopefully this gives you a better idea of fit: i am 5\\'8\\\\\\\\\" and wear a size 4/6 and they are not too tight, could easily be warn by the next size larger but have enough elasticity that a smaller size wouldn\\'t have an issue either. they pull down at the legs to fit upper to mid thigh and i am able to wear them at my waist. the material is not see through and is comfortable, even when sweaty. i highly recommend these, especially at this price. love it very nice pants. i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; and 135 lbs, with average proportions and these were too tight on my thighs. no one likes the pinch & bulge look. not worth mailing them back. maybe my 100 lb daughter can wear them. the product itself was fine. purchased for my daughter, she loves these pants!  very comfortable and soft. the product is fine. the only negative thing to say about it is that the part of the buckle that gets fished through belt loops is larger than the belt loops making it a chore to angle it through each belt loop. i love this brand. they fit well around legs and are somewhat stretchy around the waist and that it what i love. they don\\'t cut into you and move with you. honestly, they are not flattering or stylish but they are affordable and the quality is good. the fabric is soft and not too thin. the cut was roomy so my infants were able to wear them for several months. i feel very pretty in these and they don\\'t cling to my skirts.  the picture  shows them a bit longer than they turned out to be so my thighs still touch a bit more than i wanted.  but all in all, i like them. these little pants are perfect for our little crawler.  the bottom cuffs keep them pulled down and there is plenty of room in the seat for the diaper.  very nice for the price.  i would buy more. the material of these pants are  really great! the size is great. they fit great. the material is nice and soft.<br /><br />written by the mrs.~ product arrived very quickly and was packaged very well. the pants were just what i\\'ve come to expect from docker\\'s. well made and a great fit. tight but very stretchy and dark i bought these for a change of clothes for my bob based on the reviews here. i wasn\\'t let down, they are well made and very comfortable. lots of pockets. i am going to buy some for work as well. as some reviews mention i bought my jean size but will get one size down next time. i also bought the black bdu ss shirt from propper to go with these and those ran a little large too but the tailor will fix that. my kid loved these.  just enough out of style to suit his perverse sense of what is proper to wear.  he was very happy when his school told him he couldn\\'t wear them. lol üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº very flattering and made of a good material. does fit long but is what i prefer, and i have short legs. definitely buying more! i have only worn these about 3 times, and they are super comfy and also warm. they had a little pilling, but i just snipped it off. i was so impressed when i finely got these that i called my sister right a way (she owns one too now).comfortable, they breathe actually.also stretchy a lot.i am 5 11 and the fit is perfect. these are a smaller version of the bdu\\'s i wore in the military, you can\\'t go wrong with the rothco brand as it pertains to bdu\\'s...of course now made in china....exactly what i was hoping to find for my 6 year old son. i ordered a size 10 and a size 14 from this seller and this brand. he normally wears a size 7 in old navy jeans, so of course after reading the other reviews i went with a size 10 and 14 just to be on the safe side. both of these sizes will fit him perfectly with a little room to grow as he gets taller...waist is adjustable so issues there and the length is a tad longer than he would normally wear, he\\'s still a growing boy so as he gets older he can move up to the size 14 which is about 3 inches longer than the size 10. material is a little rough to the touch as they are new, but from experience i know they\\'ll soften up once they\\'ve been washed a few times.<br /><br />size 10 tag reads:<br />waist 23 inches to  27 inches<br />inseam up to 23 inches<br /><br />size 14 tag reads:<br />waist 25 inches to 29 inches<br />inseam up to 26 inches<br /><br />hope this helps with finding the right size. well made - wore them through the winter at work - cleaning parking lot and emptying trash - they are very warm yet not bulky - easy for me to quickly slip over my work pants .. run outside to do my work -- and quickly slip back off...would buy again. i give this item five stars because it is exactly what i ordered. i like these harem pants from ellazhu because they are unique and i do not like to look like everyone else and these pants give a different look, so i have bought several pairs, styles, and like them all. i bought the uk flag pants this time since i am not from the united kingdom but the pants are pretty to look at.  i have not seen anyone else wearing this style of pants but saw them advertised in a high end store magazine ad on a model, so they do make a glamour statement. ja-leeagnes s. awesome way to use bodysuits and other less appropo top pieces.  absolutely works as a pant or jumpsuit and will hardly be my last purchase of these tailored, perfect basics.  they make everything else pop! found my favorite pair of jeans! perfect if i\\'m about to wear boots and able to pull off converse likd nobody\\'s business. love them fit great the elastic waist band was really hugging hips tightly, but once i removed the elastic band it was an epic sexy fit! great for yoga! would be rad if they two toned colored the skirt part or tie dyed! got this for my boyfriend for his birthday üéÇ. he loves anything spurs related. these were really soft and i\\'m thinking about getting myself a pair. very tight around the knees but comfortable over all and pretty cute!! i\\'m 5\\'4, 115lbs and it fits perfect, if you don\\'t have thick legs. they are just what my daughter wanted. came on time.  was exactly what i wanted.  the price id complain about but that\\'s the standard price for all the belts they come in a little large but shrink perfect first wash. these are perfect for the type of workout that i do including zumba and kickboxing. i love the fabric and weight. fits great! nice and long for long legs. i\\'m gonna order more. speedy delivery, nice material, and a good fit for my body! i\\'ve seen some other people say that these leggings are closer to a medium, but that\\'s not true. they\\'re a little on the small side, which is a good thing for me at least, and i imagine they have a little give for someone who might be closer to a medium than a small.<br /><br />i love these leggings, however you need to keep in mind that since these are relatively cheap, the material is as well. yes, while the material is soft and lovely feeling, it is also a bit shiny and scuffs easily. be gentle with these or they won\\'t last you a long time! these are so cute! i love them, i should have ordered every color. for those of us who have to abide by some measure of formality in the workplace, these pants are a godsend.  the dockers go khaki is durable, dependable, and if you\\'re a knobhead like myself, you end up spilling coffee and such upon yourself more often than you would like.  enter the go khaki and its measures to save you from yourself.  if there was a standard issue of pants in the next world, these would be it.<br />do not be fooled by similar brands purporting to be &quot;performance&quot;: i made the mistake of trying out the haggar equivalent (as the result of a rather favorable pricing scheme) and all four pair died within three months.  these tend to last me upwards of a year, which is a miracle considering how bloody cheap i am and i tend to have very little rotation.  to try them is to love them. these are so comfortable!  i bought them in xl but could have gone in large so i put them in a dryer to help shrink them but they didn\\'t shrink very much at all.  still super comfy for sleep pants! i am completely satisfied with quality and workmanship of pants, but they do run a little large.  i would recommend this brand. gorgeous i do yoga 4-5 times a week in various places ..i  read everyones complaints but these pants are $3.99  even with $15 postage i ordered 6 more because really i doubt i will see these again and reallove love them ..they are obviously a close out..have flaws‚Ä¶what pants are $3.99? and yes only one color and size left because i probably bought the rest and am wearing them so often i am not telling anyone i just bought six more!  they vary in size shape and color and now that there is only one size and color it does not matter becasue i am glad it is my size and do not care about the color ..these are really nice wash well you can toss them right in the dryer and they do not sag? not sure what the problem is when lower reviews but i am looking for another source now because i can not imagine a world iwth out them ..i even layered them this winter and was so snug on my walks ..they are great fit well and when they do wear out you can cut head bands from the legs! lol!  hope to see more of these but pretty sure i will be glad i bought six more fit great, very light pant.  let my daughter borrow a pair and i never got them back.  she loves them also.  so i will be ordering more. perfect transition underwear for potty training- much better than pull ups ordered this pants for my 2mth old baby boy who is more on the chubby side. it did fit as expected, the material is soft and comfy. will definitely buy other sizes and colours as needed. i love these pants.  1. great material, stretchy, not thin and not shiny.  can be used for dress pants or just regular pants.  2. smooth transaction and they got here on time (needed them for a wedding).  would definitely recommend these to anyone. i love these! super soft and the logo looks amazing! i wish they were a little longer. if they were i would totally give 5 stars! the fabric is not as soft as i expected but it fits and works perfectly these are my favorite pants, i need them in every color, looks great with a camisole and flats, nice little denim jacket and its a go!! wash carefully but otherwise great outfit my daughter is joining the navy to be shipped in march and she loved this shirt! makes a mom proud! great item! we ordered for a family wedding. pants were a little loose at the ankles, but that\\'s not a bad thing. screen print was clear and easily recognizable. everyone thought he was super cute in his baby tux. took pictures later for baby book, since it was so cute. thank you! these were exactly what i was looking for! they fit very well and go perfectly under the short skirt that i am wearing for halloween! great purchase! i was skeptical about buying them since i am 5\\'6\\\\\\\\\" and have to buy size long pants, but they are the perfect length. i also wear size 5 pants and the leggings fit perfectly! i really like these pants i am a full time babysitter for small children and im constantly moving and running and getting messy these pants are great and really comfortable for my constant moving day. these are great leggings for the fall/winter. they are lined with fleece and are nice and warm. they also have a slight sheen to them which i really like. this is a one size fits all product -- i am a size 2, and these fit perfectly. they do have some stretch to them, so i\\'m sure they would work for someone a bit larger than me, but i don\\'t think they would work for \\'big\\' girls. they\\'re super soft but do run large. cute pants but too large. will use them later when baby is bigger. she is 8 weeks and 10 lbs. it\\'s as described,  fits around the body perfectly.  it looks too cute on him.  glad i chose this pajamas for him. i like the high waist on these, and i like that the length is good -i\\'m 5 foot 9, and i got a large, and they\\'re not too short. these are great little cotton pants that stay on well. my little guy is thin and these fit well, i love the cuffed ankle so he\\'s not tripping over them like other pants.these are great for playing around the house and really good price for 3 pairs. there are the perfect fleece pj pant for winter.  the fleece is soft, the design is cute and vibrant, and the fit is excellent.  i\\'m about 5\\'8 and wear a 10 or 12 pant usually.  i ordered large and they fit in the waist but are roomy in the seat and thighs so they are comfy to wear without worrying the will fall off unless i tie them.  so far they seem to be holding up great in the wash, the fleece is still soft and vibrant after multiple trips through the washer and dryer.  awesome pants, i quickly ordered a second pair in another pattern once i saw how awesome these were. these yoga pants are almost perfect. they are light in material which is great for the summer. the only downfall is their isn\\'t enough &#34;acid wash&#34; it looks mostly black, but they are super comfy! so pretty/ arrived on time. not exactly as in picture but close enough. daughter liked it for the baby.. i needed a pair of pants that still look great, but that i can where while pregnant. i am 8 months, and these fit great. i love that they are long enough for my 6ft frame, which i was unsure of. i go the large to ensure length and was surprised at the overall great fit. these track pants were a perfect fit. they are so  comfy and i even wear them when i go shopping which i don\\'t usually do. my son is 5, still has problems with wetting the bed.  i tried to just let him sleep with just underwear to see if that would help or inspire him...nope.  he would soak himself and the bed and not wake up, so in the morning when i woke him up he was completely soaked in pee head to toe and would need a bath. so, since pull ups are soooo expensive i bought one pair of these to try. they work really well. he doesn\\'t pee through them, they are much bulkier than i thought they would be.  they do take very long to dry and since i only have one i have to wash and dry every day. i will be purchasing another so my light bill doesn\\'t sky rocket with drying multiple times! i\\'m 22 yrs old, 5ft 5in tall on my best day and i\\'ve recently lost weight from 135lbs or so down to 106lbs due to being ill. nothing in my closet fits me anymore including my tank tops,shirts and jeans, even with belts and i\\'ve started physical therapy 3 times a week (for who knows how long) for my hips so i have to wear sweatpants to be able to do all of the bending/stretching/peddling/squatting and i prefer not to have to worry about my current sweatpants falling off of me while i\\'m there but i also didn\\'t want to spend a ridiculous amount on new clothes since i probably will be gaining some weight back. i read the reviews and opted for the small (but it was the only size available anyway).<br /><br />the small fits exactly how i expected it to (thanks to everyone\\'s reviews!). they washed very well, didn\\'t shrink, they fit my waist (okay,more like hips right now) very well, i don\\'t have to worry about them falling down during therapy (already tested!) but i still have some extra space for when i gain more weight. the legs are a longer length but i prefer all my jeans/long pants/sweatpants longer so when i sit/lay down my ankles don\\'t show (always been a peeve of mine). i plan to order at least 1 more pair before they\\'re sold out because i can\\'t beat the price in store or online and i\\'ve checked! they aren\\'t so thin that they\\'re see through and i don\\'t follow laundry directions (although i should) but they washed well both times and handled being in the dryer set on high without any shrinking or fading (same with all my other jeans and sweatpants!). i added that just in case the washing instructions state differently. very good product. definitely assists in getting the pressure off my lower back. they fit how i expected they would and were much warmer than i expected. i haven\\'t taken them out on a run yet, but i did wear them as a base layer when i was out shoveling snow in -20f weather and i kept pretty warm. it takes a little bit to get used to how snug they fit on the undercarriage but that\\'s to be expected. i love these yoga pants.  they feel like a &#34;second skin&#34; and are so flattering.  after christmas, i am ordering another pair. i received this from our baby registry.  the quality was wonderful.  i had to exchange the jacket.  the company responded to me immediately and sent out the replacement jacket before they even received the one i had.  you rarely see this type of service.  great product! received the item fast and was just as expected, great price too! wish it washed better, the elastic at the smocking is getting a little pilly from washing, but it\\'s really cute and comfortable very well made and comfortable material. these pants feel amazing. and they make me feel amazing because they show my allegiance to the autobots. join me, and wear these pants. just for these pants (very quickly) and love them!!!!!!! fit perfectly and make my somewhat flat bottom look much more perky!! and they are actually comfortable!! i will be buying more! these were a gift i bought for someone else and they fit perfect and are super funny.  i guess i didnt pay attention to the fact that all the cats have upside down crosses on their friggin heads but it doesnt matter since the cat photos are ridiculous anyways. these pants are so freaking comfortable, feel like pajamas, but look dressy. only slight issue is i have chunky thighs and when i sit down, it stretches the fabric a bit, making it look not as nice. but that\\'s just a minor thing, still love the pants. oh ya, they are a little long for my 5\\'5&#34; body. kickee clothing seem to run large but that\\'s fine because i just fold up the sleeves and ankles and my child eventually grows into it.  the fabric is thin and silky smooth.  i almost wish these came in adult sizes because it feels so nice against the skin.  they hold up well in the wash and don\\'t pill.  they also don\\'t shrink in the dryer.  they are particularly good for spring when it\\'s not too cold but not warm enough for shorts.  my son wore these to bed as pajamas. love these onesies.  they have a lot of stretch in them and very comfortable and soft for baby.  favorite onesie for baby! good fitting pants not a bad deal for baby clothes, considering they will wear them a few times. a little on the thin side, but all in all a pretty good purchase. the comfort of these pants are the key to their greatness. they adjust on the sides. speaking of the sides the cargo pockets hold the things i need from any store run. i\\'ve already washed this pair a few times and the color is still holding strong. amazing. i was a little nervous about getting these pants. so glad i did. they are perfect for the summer and vacation. they fit right on, i am 5\\'5 and 140. they are very long which i like so i can make them the length i like. they also don\\'t have a hem at all. that is fine. i would recommend these to friends and would (will) buy again. very comfortable fit and a really nice color.  i can even wear them to walk the dog.  recommend them to anyone who wants to just relax or run out to the store.  decent quality as well. nice fr pants great service and would buy again note the strap that goes underneath your foot. managed to miss that when i bought these, but found them to be an advantage. i have a heavier duty pant that i\\'d prefer to wear anytime it\\'s snowing or at a windchill under say 20 fahrenheit, but this is a solid pair of lightweight pants to run in for anything above that temperature. i love these pants so much, that they get washed twice a week.  i literally walk in the house, take off work clothes, and immediately put on these pants.  i\\'m ordering 2 or 3 more pairs, because they are just so comfortable!<br /><br />the only problem is the elastic at the waist.  its not sewed in quite right, so if you flip the top over (as is the common style), the elastic inside will roll and twist.  my husband was able to fix it and get it &#34;de-rolled&#34; (it took him about 20 minutes), and then i just ran the sides through the sewing machine quickly to better tack down the elastic, so that now, i can fold them over at the top, with no rolling. great quality, they hold up well, super comfy, i am going to get some more.  good for wearing not just to yoga class. my kid loved it, she feels like a dancing woman in it, fits perfect and makes her look feminine sizing off... i ordered a size smaller - too small i went up 1 size and fits better but still doesn\\'t fit right... soft material, easy to pull on and great for wiggling. my baby is 4 months, in the 50 percentile for height and weight and it fits perfectly. not for winter temps, but nice fit, color and comfortability. the pants are tight looking ,but they are very comfortable it\\'s like they adjust to your legs .. i definitely will be buying more probably the best pair of buffalo/antelope wrangling pants i have ever owned. as i ride through the prairie with the great american eagle on my shoulder, i know that i am free. god does bless america. after reading variety of reviews was nervous to order; however, i did and i love them! i am usually between small and medium, i chose small so they would fit a little snug and they are perfect! great fit just a bit thin but i like that fortunately, i read previous posts regarding the sizing of these pants and ordered a large vs. a medium. i have a size 32&#34; waist and 28&#34; inseam and the size large fit perfectly after being washed. of note, not only do the listed sizes run small, but these pants will still shrink after a wash, even in cold water and a low temp dryer setting. however, because i knew that ahead of time, i managed to get a pair that fits perfectly. i bought these pants for airsoft and learned the material is thicker than anticipated which is good because they won\\'t wear out as quickly, but may be hot in the summer months. additionally, the belt loops will not accommodate a thick belt, about 3/4&#34; is the best they\\'ll fit. however, at $29, it\\'s hard to beat the price; these are a great alternative to pricier lbx ranger green or 5.11 pants especially if you\\'re simply going for a look. i like the details. cool looking pants love em!!!  colors not exact, but the quality is great!!! my levi\\'s are 34 waist x 32 length. i\\'m 6 foot tall and weigh 210 lbs. regardless these pants are sized small, so i ordered a large which is a 36/38  waist. they fit perfectly, well almost. they are tight in the crotch. if you are going for the, \\\\\\\\\"behold my buried treasure, matey!\\\\\\\\\" look you are good to go. they are 100% rayon. i don\\'t know what kind of self respecting pirate would have been caught dead on the high seas wearing rayon pants. a natural fabric like cotton would have been much more authentic. they don\\'t have any pockets. other than that these are better than average ren/pirate pants. love everything about this line but unfortunately i end up giving most if the pants away because the sizing is not for the american womens body. i keep ordering hoping they will scale their sizing to usa sizing ! in the meantime tops fit and continue to give great ellazhu gifts!!!! am going with 5 stars because of style, fashion , value and service! stay hope everyone i am confident they will come through with the sizing issues !!!! great fit & smooth material***** these pants are awesome saved meoney and they feel great on pants fit great.  they are very comfortable.  i use them dressed down and also for casual occasions. great buy for the buck it looks just like the picture, and i it is comfortable and the perfect size. the colors are also vibrant these tights are awesome. they\\'re a bit more high waisted than i thought they\\'d be, but otherwise they are perfect. the material is really soft and silky. the fit is perfect (5\\'8 135lbs) and the pattern is really pretty. nice bright colors. shipping took a while, but that was expected. would definitely recommend these if you\\'re looking for something different! awesome product. we\\'ll made. very sexy. item excellent in every way and arrived on time. just the wrong size. we got these to use overnight for potty training..they wash and dry nice too..also they are comfy and absorbent--unlike just wearing regular boys briefs to bed....we used them for a few months and now dont need them i love these pants. i can use them as pajama pants, or work out in them. i can bend and stretch and really move in them with no restrictions. they are very light, soft and comfortable. i have bought multiple pairs and plan to buy more. rothco comes through great with authentic rvn tiger stripe. well made. ilove them they r great the cut to fit is genius these crop pants are just great i have to pair in yellow one in coral and white now order one in navy and aura  love them have enjoyed wearing them. love them so comfy and soft. lady who gave bad review does like nice or good or soft, or comfy crop pants  i love these. awesome. good quality. no lint balls appearing. i love these so much, i don\\'t want to take them off (and don\\'t have to since i work from home). and i bought the red pair a few days ago. excellent product!!!!  will buy from again love the pants. wish the material was not quite so heavy but will probably appreciate it when winter gets here.  will likely order more in different colors.  i wish they had amazon prime and did not take 2 weeks to arrive. excellent very cute outfit.  i ordered it a size larger because you don\\'t know how clothing will fit ordering from amazon.  i received it and it was beautiful just as it is in the picture.  it\\'s a little big, but once i wash and hang dry it, it should fit perfectly (i\\'m hoping).  even if it doesn\\'t, i\\'ll still wear it with no problems.  i just like my stuff a &#34;little&#34; fitted. my daughter loves peppa.  in general terms, clothing has great quality and the art is really nice and well done.  the problem is with the sizes.  i bought everything when my dauther was 3 and a half; and, reading the comments and talking a look at the size table i order everything for 6y, and i wasn\\'t wrong.  t-shirts, jackets and dressess fits perfect and she will keep using them all this year.  but, pants are really for a 6y kid, so she will need to wait at least half a year to wear them (she is a tall kid). received my pants already! so love them!! sizing a bit bigger than i had expected but will enjoy them :) its awesome!!! if you are a dead pool fan, like myself, you will not be disappointed  its awesome, all i have to say in the unlikely event that you don\\'t already own these pants, you should probably one click order them right at this second (unless your not american, in which case you should probably follow the proper channels and become one, also right at this second).  i know the economy is failing under the current president, and we probably won\\'t be able to undo the mess we are in, but i mean what other country has pants like this?  where else can you get your patriotism on to the tune of hammertime by mc hammer?  where else would people even buy pants that look like this? answer? no where! really comfortable and don\\'t ride up. i love the feel of this footie.  the fabric is amazing.  the sizing seems a little off.  my guy is 3 months old and fairly average-sized.  the outfit is pretty tight.  but it\\'s so yummy when he wears it! i had a pair just like this when i was 17 perfect i love them they fit well they stretch without looking like your bulky perfect the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because u have to order 2 sizes bigger they fit perfectly!  i wish i bought more in different colors.  i will follow-up on this.  also, i received the pants in 2 days.  i was amazed.  thank you - pepe\\' exactly what i ordered and i get many compliments my teenage daughter loves to wear these under her skirts.  nice and short so they don\\'t show.  perfect to wear under shorter skirts. my adult son is a huge metallica fan and i purchased these lounge pants as a christmas gift, big hit.  he said they are really comfortable.  nice \\\\\\\\\"surprise\\\\\\\\\" gift, made well. i have many different brands of yoga pants, and the two pair i just received are the best. love the fit, they do not get baggy in the knees, and the length in a large ( i am 5\\'8) is perfect. i will be ordering more. i wish that i had found these sooner instead of blowing my $$$ on crappy light weight, baggy, short in length yoga pants. very nice. i did manage to lose one of the leg chains but i\\'m not upset about it. they still look great and hold up well. they do fit a tad small in the waist though so buy bigger and wear a belt. really well made and fits perfectly.  not too tight, not loose, fit as snugly as i had hoped for.  fits perfect, no problems at all. really cute cut, funky and fun. i love them. the tiny skull snaps are a very nice touch. lots of compliments. i love the way they feel and how warm they are. i will be ordering more. per the sizing chart i should have bought a m but wasn\\'t convinced so i got a l and i\\'m glad i did.  i\\'m 5\\'7 and weigh about 145 to give some perspective.  they are great pants very comfortable and have washed & dried twice using cold water with no issues.<br /><br />update: i love these pants so much that i got a second pair and they stretch nicely and was able to continue to wear them through my pregnancy and still do afterwards just got my pants today the amount of joy i feel in not only the quality of the pants and promptness of delivery cannot be expressed in enough words i ordered these for my son and i somehow had it in my mind that these were sweats. then they came in and i realized they were sleep pants. oh well, he still likes them lol. they fit about as expected but they\\'re slightly long on him, they drag the ground. he\\'s 5\\'7&#34;. hopefully that gives you an idea of the length. overall they were a great purchase. but i do wish i had read the description correctly. i purchased the black nylon tights and they fit perfect. i am 5\\'6, 120. the color really pops and although i am not the biggest fan of nylon, the material looks quite expressive with leather flats or riding boots. i recommend. pants fit fine top small these are forgiving leggings and fit well and are made well i am a female , 5\\'7 height, 125 lbs, approx measures are - waist 26, hips 36, chest 34-35.<br />i picked small size and it fits absolutely perfect. doesn\\'t fall off or not too tight.<br />i run every day for over 3 miles and sometimes it gets hot...lol, but never in my pants :)<br />to be serious, this is amazing, and i will order more 500%. i bought these for my daughter who loves them!  i would give them 5 stars, but the workmanship is not quite 5 star material.  however, they are original and fun and i feel that i got what i paid for.  i expect one season from them but if they last longer, my daughter will be very happy. these are very comfortable, haven\\'t picked up any of my dog\\'s long hair but are fairly long. i am5\\'6&#34; and i have them rolled up twice so they don\\'t drag on the ground. i bought these to carry in my motorcycle bag. i have had to break them out twice so far and i stayed completely dry. these pants are breathable and very light weight. i imagine if i had to put these on this summer i wouldn\\'t be too concerned with them creating a heat trap that would cause me to sweat to the point of being soaked anyways. looks great, good quality, glad its alittle big, she can wear it longer before growing out of it love these! i love these pants. i\\'m 5\\'9 and weigh 130 and ordered a medium and it fits great! definitely gonna be ordering more of these pants! i\\'m from england (good evening) and i have chubby knee syndrome, for those of you that are unaware of this illness it leaves the sufferer with the constant sensation that he/she has fatty deposits surrounding the knee caps.  although my knees are fairly \\'fat free\\' i believe once my pants arrive i can live a normal life again.      thanks zubaz.    pros great for chubby knee syndrome sufferers  cons no wolf/moon print available...yet beautiful adjustable fit with lots of extra ties and pockets, and the material is so soft it feels like something scrumptious under the fingertips. love! wonderful product!!! im going to have one very happy boy. not just another thrown together seatbelt buckle, i have ordered others in the past that wernt made so well, but looked nice in the picture. this one is as pictured, the colors are brighter in my opinion, durable and with  marvel tag of authenticity haha.love love love this!maybe will order the hulk for myself.thanks to the seller and amazon also for speedy delivery:) just like the pictures! loved it love these pants.strong durable material yet so comfy. i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; i got the medium and the length is absolutely perfect, no dragging like other pants i\\'ve tried. thank you,  will be buying again. was pleased. fit as expected. comfy. i\\'m extremely satisfied with this purchase; the product is great, the fabric is high quality and very comfortable. i opted to order a size up since the other reviews noted that it ran small. normally i wear a size small but chose to order a medium and they fit perfectly! (i\\'m 5\\'5 and 115 lbs) the shipping was also very quick, i got it around 4-5 days before it was expected, which was a nice surprise!<br />overall i\\'m extremely content, i would totally order again from this seller and probably buy more of these shorts! lots of compliments but it is drop waisted and hard to see that from description. came with black ribbon sash that\\'s cheap so i bought a better belt these pants fit like a glove and have great stretch. i am on the &#34;hippy&#34; side and they fit comfortably.  i ordered a size 9 and i usually take a size 6-8.  i would highly recommend them. got them they fit love it, comfy and lenght is great for a tall person like me. will buy all the colors of this collection. awesome pants. has enought pocket to store all my paint ball gear.  breaths well and the ties at the end of the pants are nice too the pants are exactly how they\\'re described and i love them!! they\\'re my best comfy pants so i had to get another pair. i made a mistake when ordering and their customer service was totally accommodating. i love these pants !! i bought these for halloween - i was peg bundy. they were perfect! the fit was right, as was the price. i love it my daughter loves it despite that elsa & anna don\\'t really look like in frozen, the movie. after purchasing another pants stretcher which was very hard to use, i bought this one.  this stretcher works much better because it has a vise-like clamp on one side which will lock in place.  you then twist the ratchet-like bar to expand the unit to the desired amount of stretch.  it has a hanger you can use to hang the stretcher up while the pants dry. okay i am a size 6-8 jeans and i ordered a size small due to the reviews.  the pants fit perfect, which means they do run a bit big, but not by much. i would have been fine with a medium as well.  in terms of whether or not they work, they do! i wore these pants on saturday to go on a hike and by the end i was able to squeeze sweat out of the pants. love love love. and will probably be ordering more.<br /><br />1 thing...they require hand washing everything came very well and satisfied with products its a perfect airy summer pants.  easy set up, fits perfectly, color is nice as well.  i wish they would offer more color, i would buy more.  i really love it and happy with it. grandson loved it, it fit well, was made well and combined with the whole outfit , he couldnt wait to show off to his friends. jeans fit good was what i expected. shipment did\\'nt take long and my daughter loved it. this cute outfit is such a great price, i had to get it. it is also very cute in person. it just looks a little bit like pajamas, due to the loose shirt. a onesie shirt would be cuter, but i still love the picture on the shirt and matching striped pants. they are very comfortable!!! i\\'m rather short - under 5ft - so these are a little long.  nothing a needle and thread can\\'t handle.  other than that, they look really nice.  give you a nice body line.  very comfortable too. bought these to use as maternity pants to lounge around in and was very pleased with them. they run a little big, but they are super soft and comfortable. multi-camo better then digital, it just blends better and the pants fit great better than military issue purchased these as a gift for my husband.  he loves them.  he uses them when he has to go out and clear snow.  they keep him warm and dry - perfect for new england winters! quick delivery.<br />the leggings fit perfect &amp; i love the color.<br />also they are a usa brand!! the young man i bought this for was very happy with it and it using it i wear these just about everyday.  they are made and fit well and very comfortable. very good so i bought these and i have to say they are a great fit, enough room for my expanding belly and they fit very well everywhere else no sagginess or really tight thank goodness. they are very comfortable and lightweight. i am 3.5 months pregers and i already don\\'t fit in my regular clothes so these are a lifesaver. i love these, definitely would recommend these. at rex kwan do, we use the buddy system. no more flying solo. you need somebody watching your back at all times. second off, you\\'re gonna learn to discipline your image. you think i got where i am today because i dressed like peter pan over here?    take a look at what i\\'m wearing, people. you think anybody wants a roundhouse kick to the face while i\\'m wearing these bad boys? forget about it. last off, my students will learn about self respect. you think anybody thinks i\\'m a failure because i go home to starla at night? forget about it! great omg, i am so in love with these pants!!!  i\\'m a short woman, 5\\' and am a 3x.  i wasn\\'t sure how they were going to look on me, but i absolutely love them!! they are so comfortable you can dress them up or down.  they stretch in all the right spots and make my butt looking amazing!!!  i\\'m going to order the other color i saw available!!! these are so cute! i bought these because the winter was getting &#34;cold&#34; here in la, and i needed something a little more cozy than my yoga pants. these definitely do the trick, and i enjoy the print! when i washed them, i loved that they didn\\'t shrink. i was skeptical that they would fit on me, but since i am losing weight i figured even if they shrunk or were too small, they would eventually fit. thankfully that wasn\\'t the case. i know, you only want uk &#62; us size guidelines. after reading lots of reviews, i ordered large, i\\'m 6 ft, 160 lbs, and they fit perfect!  i hope this helps someone. otherwise, the quality seems quite good, and those weird stirrup thingys seem to work as intended. good work wear super comfortable, thicker than expected fabric, fun galaxy space cosmic pattern, wear it all the time -- i\\'m a size 6 in pants and 5\\'4&#34; height, and these fit great. these are high-waisted, so keep that in mind when purchasing. very satisfied five stars i was about to buy this and i found a review on target\\'s website for the item and discovered that the sizes of training pants given are medium and large.  it is a great deal if these will fit your child.  i\\'ve pasted the review below.  thank you stacie r of athens, ga.  you\\'ve saved me $30!    \\\\\\\\\"not all information given\\\\\\\\\" august 10, 2009 reviewer:  mom in training \\\\\\\\\"stacie r\\\\\\\\\" (athens, ga)        \\\\\\\\\"i thought this was a really good deal for training pants and a potty, but i was wrong. if you have a more normal sized child it might work for you. basically what the information in the product description doesn\\'t tell you is that they send you the potty plus 6 pairs of size medium trainers and 6 pairs of size large trainers. the medium weight range begins at 28lbs. my daughter barely weighs 24lbs so these would swallow her. i would also think that many children who are actively potty training wouldn\\'t go through 2 sizes of training pants. if your child is in this weight range then this product is probably a good deal.\\\\\\\\\" a gift for my wife. she is 5\\'10&#34; 135lbs. large in the bottom. got a medium. when we opened the package, i thought it was for a child! no fear, these pants fit her perfectly! she is new to yoga pants, but within 5 minutes adored them. i bought another brand, but she liked these more. she said they are incredibly comfortable and soft. i will definitely be buying other colors.<br />guys, let me tell you... get these for your wife and your getting yourself a gift too. i liked the product. this is my first time buying these pants. they are very soft, and they were the exact color shown on amazon. i liked the feel but they seemed long. nice pants.  material does not hold moisture. great practice pants i got these beautyful seamless hot shorts in white for my wife and with a seamless tube top white and wow !!!!! ordering more !!!!! :>) great product, thank you! it\\'s a belt.  it holds your pants up.  it\\'s got adventure time.  people like it.  i get compliments on it whenever i wear it from young and not-so-young alike.  the piece that adjusts the size is so wide that it\\'s a pain to put on with some of my pants though, i have some jeans that i actually had to like roll the belt at an angle to work it through. but it worked great for my halloween costume go back to the 80s with these countdown pants. very thin, but we\\'ll constructed pants. no loose threads, stitching is right on. only rub, was the wrong color. but that is okay. i wanted silver gray too, so i am fine with that. comfortable to wear, but if you do not want 80s tught, go a size or 2 bigger in the waist. zippered legs make instead fit easy. overall was fun to go back to the 80s with these pants. you might like them too. break dancing optional. super fast shipping. great quality. they\\'re very flattering and stretchy! i\\'m 160 5\\'7 and a size large fit me. these are very comfortable and can be worn to lounge around or dressed up a little for a casual gathering.  quality not great but ...... these pants looked so cute in the picture that i had to get them, although ordinarily i refrain from purchasing clothing online because i can never know how they will fit.  these pants fit true to size (i am a 5\\'6\\\\\\\\\", 125lb. medium size).  the pant legs run just perfect to the ground (from the picture i thought they might be short, like capris, but they\\'re not) and the style is flattering.  the fabric was a little thinner than i had imagined; again, i couldn\\'t tell from the photo whether they were flannel or what not.  you can tell when the package comes - the pants fold very flat, but even though they are lightweight, they are still warm.  pair these pants with a cookie monster tee and some fluffy socks and you\\'ll be both cute and cozy! omgosh i freaking love this so much !!! received the pants when you said.  they fit.  i am pleased with the purchase and the delivery for my 29\\\\\\\\\" inseam, i probably should have gotten large. with the xl there is ample room in the waist just a tad too long in the legs. other than that the cargo pants are very comfortable and stylish. i like them better than jeans. as we grow out we don\\'t seem to grow up! i love this brand\\'s palazzo pants. excellent material, they fit well and are very comfortable. leggings that look like jeans and they snug your curves just right. i am 34 - 36 depending on how the company decides to size things.<br />to be safe i went with l/xl (36-42)<br /><br />it is a little on big side but thats ok. better to be alittle big than too small and no time to get replacement before kids party.<br />in hind sight i would have gotten s/m so comfy for winter! a must have! school, with a dress, etc. sooo cute! üòç these pants fit great! loved them. only thing is that the bottom is way too long. other than that, a great pear of pajamas :d love my harem yoga pants, they are so comfortable! i\\'ll probably be getting another pair! love love love! fit perfectly! super soft pants that are comfy on my chubby baby. my son needed a pair of pants for practice and these are working great.  internal pads stay put as expected. my son is 5\\'8&#34; and they are long enough as well. good quality. would purchase again i am a grandmother that babysits for 3 grand kids.  these are sure coming in handy.  they do absorb more than underwear. and they don\\'t like when it run down there leg.  they sure help me out a lot. less pants to change.   great quality of material in underwear. they do fit a little big but that is good for the little ones to be able to pull up and down there own pants. very comfortable, good quality, good price!!! my son loves this blanket. its great for summer because its not very thick and it\\'s a breathable material. it\\'s super soft and well worth the money. would recommend to anyone with a small child! i purchased these in my eighth month of pregnancy. i\\'m a 14 to 16 and these fit great. they are very comfy and are nice to wear around the house. this is a high quality product and it wears well the baby is very comfortable and light weight perfect for summer outfits.  my grandchildren love them.  i will buy another 3 sets due to the quality of the product.  it is a must buy and very lost cost compared to other stores and online shopping.  perfect!! i searched a few stores for these pants and none fit like these do for my 6 yr old son. they are the correct length and waist size. i bought these sweat pants for my son in the af. they are well made and true to size. i would recommend these. i love these pants! the fit is perfect, the material is comfortable. i wish the pockets were a little deeper. great summer capris. it fit perfectly and my man is so happy with them awesome! awesome material, wonderfully cut and in a lovely vivid color. the first piece of baby clothing i want to buy for all of my friends having their first babies. it\\'s not restrictive at all and is so soft. very easy to manage diaper changes as the material is easily stretchable but doesn\\'t stay stretched out love them they are comfy but they do ride up the thigh when sitting down i love them the are perfect. very comfy! the material is soft and not too thin and the fit is nice and loose throughout the leg. i like the thick, stretchy band at the waist. nice potty scottys are awesome!  they absorb the same amount as pull-ups.  they do run a little on the big side though, so be very careful as to which size you order.  they are easy enough to pull up and down that my son can do it without my help. love ordering from amazon and this is my second year ordering from this vendor.  i have no issues with either organization.  the pants seem a bit stiff, but i think that is the norm.  once they have been washed i am sure they will soften up and fit more comfortably. lifts the butt, but the material is heavier than i expected which is not great for miami weather.  not sure when i will wear them - so soft and comfortable, and the elastic at the ankles allowed our son to wear these even when other 18 mos. pants were still a little too long. these pants are exactly what i was looking for and fit very well.  they are a light material which is nice for the summer/spring.  i would order shorts or a skirt if they were offered!  thank you for the great capri! out of everything i\\'ve ordered it was the appropriate size and good material. got the cute extra hair tie , nice add. will buy again. ive read previous reviews this was a perfect fit for me though, i am 5\\'4 and 120lb fit. and it\\'s hard to find lose but fitting clothes. this was excellent! great price i am surprised i am the only one at work sporting these great capris.  they have an elastic waist with adjustable waist tie.  nice split leg that is roomy and comfortable. these are the exact same as they were 20 years ago. awesome gift for any nostalgic coach potato. great fit and colors are very close to picture. i love these pants. best kind of joggers i\\'ve owned. i bought a pair from charlotte russe & these are way better than those even. as everyone else said, order a size larger. i wear a medium in these sort of pants but the large fits best. i love them. they are also a thicker material so they keep me fairly warm. they are so cute with my leopard print sneakers. if anyone is questioning on buying these, do it. you will love them. i purchased the light gray color. i love the pockets. they look like joggers should. i want to live in these pants! -the girlfriend of this amazon user. i bought the 9-12 months luvable friends 3-pack. they are incredibly soft and the colors are really cute. however, the pants are long for a 9-12 month old. live it, always get compliments with this pans these training pants are wonderfully simple. they are absorbent, my little guy can pee in them once without it getting all over the place, but they still feel wet to the touch. pull ups just feel like a diaper so what is the point? how can your child learn if they don\\'t feel wet? these keep the mess in for the most part, but make it uncomfortable enough that my little one wants to use the potty. i have potty trained several children while working as a nanny and would always recommend these over pull ups. love these - they are soooooo soft the fit is great and just the right weight for outdoor activities, i do not run in just these but for the price , perfect for a base layer i love love these pants smooth fit i was a little nervous when i first put these on because the material felt heavy but as i was working out the material was great and very quick drying! the size was a little bigger than expected (i got a xs instead of my normal s and they fit perfectly) but i love that the band can be worn either rolled down or up to support my growing belly. all in all these are perfect for my strength training and yoga/pilates routines.<br /><br />i received a free workout capri from for two fitness in exchange for providing an honest review of this product. all opinions stated are my own. these fit well on a size 6 person. we only purchased them for that size person and she is pleased. perfect fit fabric feels great and falls just right fits well , light weight fits great, no issues. went skiing in them and they fit over my ski boots fine and kept me very warm. perfect all-around khaki chinos! i like the little bit of \\'stretch\\' they have to them. i weigh about 135lbs and am 5\\'5&#34; ~ they fit perfect in length and everywhere else. i guess mobile i can\\'t ask a question. my question is, i\\'m looking for definitely floor length palazzos. i\\'m 5\\'7 &125lbs. will a small be too short? in my job i have to look profeessional. as my pregnancy progress i just bought a bigger size, same pants. these pants made my pregnancy very comfortable. the life of an 80\\'s skateboard legend.. fame ,money, crashing and burning, then coming back out of the woodwork. this movie has it all.jason is one of the gnarliest skaters ever. buy this movie! ordered large and it was very long.  then i ordered a<br />second pair in medium and they were just as long but<br />can wear both.  better a bit long than too short!  i\\'m<br />5\\'5&#34;.  very nice material, well made.<br /><br />5\\' fit as expected. was a gift and they loved it. they sent me a picture of the baby wearing it and he looked so cute most comfy pajamas i own and they\\'re adorable. what more could you want? these pants are long (i am 5\\'9\\\\\\\\\") and they are perfect, albeit a bit snug.  not a fan of working out at the gym with tight pants, nothing a long t-shirt cannot fix though!! very comfortable. i love this jumpsuit, its comfy and o so cute on. you are getting exactly what you see when you order this. the are some warm pants. they are true to fit. came in the aloted time. they are long so order your normal size that you would wear. good fit. comfortable and cute!  they fit pretty good - a little tight but what do you expect with yoga pants.  not too tight though. these feel good and are thick. my child does like to wear them and mess in them. they clean up very well in the wash. good quality. he is actually like 50lbs and tall/thin and still fits in them. great for my nephew! looks like it fits like as a normal size. soft fabric. good deal! definately heat up my workout!! i am 5\\'6\\' and weight around 145 and these pants fit perfectly ! they are a little stretchy which is nice and are very thin and soft. great i really love these leggings. they fit really nicely. what else can i say. now i feel just like a real 80\\'s bodybuilder. these things are a steal for only 36 dollars!  pick up 5 or 6 pair. great when working in the garden or picking up prostitutes. they make you crave steroids. how could you not want these pants. bought these for our annual 4th of july parade. they help in the &#34;most outrageous costume&#34; category. even though it is usually about 100 degrees and 99% humidity on july 4th here in central florida these are light and loose enough to be fairly comfortable. they seem like they are nicely made and haven\\'t faded after washing. great work uniform pants. i had these pants before and needed a different color now. they are perfect, they are an entirely different and new idea. i don\\'t feel like putting them off again. and i feel good in organic cotton anyway. very recommendable. makes my butt  look good, and feels like leggings daughter loves her nirvana lounge pants! i\\'m very pleased with these pants. the materiel is thick and the pants well constructed. they fit perfectly (34w 34i), out of the box, and have not shrunk in the wash (warm wash, low heat dry). so far, they\\'ve maintained their crease well. the cargo pockets are unobtrusive yet quite roomy. these are the coolest bdu\\'s i own, most of which are digital camo patterns.<br /><br />and not only that, they have a zipper fly, which is a far cry from the sometimes annoying button fly (which is imho too easy to forget to check sometimes lol...the only digital pattern which offers a zipper is cadpat, the canadian army pattern, which has only two rear pockets.)<br /><br />if you can envision yourself with these pants and all else is black except perhaps the white shoes, buy them. these yoga pants are very comfy, and i wear them all the time. they fit well and keep their shape even after heavy usage (i\\'ve washed mine 20+ times and they still fit really good). the colors are very cute and, of course, work well for my yoga class. i even wear them to the store sometimes. i definitely recommend these! also, i am 5\\'5&#34;, about 130, and i ordered a medium. i ordered these tribal pants in red and a size small. i am 5\\'1\\\\\\\\\" and thin but with a round booty. after reading the reviews saying that they were \\\\\\\\\"too tight\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\"too short\\\\\\\\\" i began to have hope these would actually fit me! like someone else said, i hate gambling ordering clothes online because being so petite it\\'s a challenge to find things that fit and aren\\'t a half foot too long. these exceeded my expectations! &lt;3 they fit great, are the perfect length and i love them in the fun red color. however, another girl in my belly dance class said she has the same pants in black, i couldn\\'t believe it, she\\'s much taller than me! but she says she washed them and then hung them to dry wet and they stretched longer. (she is also very thin though) but if you\\'re average tall and skinny for 9.99 maybe it\\'s worth it to buy them and try that! they are wonderful and comfortable to dance in. my baby love this footed pants. it\\'s his pajama every night and he sleeps soundly! i purchased the waistband stretcher and it really works. the parts are all plastic, but i have had no problem with them. attach to waistband (i secure the front first) and turn the inner knob to stretch pants as far as you need. it has saved me from buying new jeans, which i am having difficulty finding anyway. i highly recommend this product! super cute and cozy! please bring them back - these pants are the best fit levi\\'s i have every had the pleasure to wear. i can wear them all year around and they are very comfortable. love them, they are a little too long for a petite woman, i wish they were shorter , but still love them the pants fit ok. they are very comfortable. they are a style i have never worn. the only issue i have is the stripped pants leg. it\\'s tighter than the black leg because the material is different. i can\\'t wait to wear them out though! i first bought a pair of these pants at macy\\'s.  they turned out to be the best pants i have ever bought!  i am difficult to fit, with a large waist in comparison to slender legs.  these pants fit perfectly and provide a slenderizing fit.    they don\\'t wrinkle and wash beautifully.    i now have a pair in as many colors as i can find. i wear yoga pants on a regular basis because i work in a warehouse & go to the gym immediately after work. i\\'ve ordered 7 of these. i love the variety of color & being 5\\'10&#34;, the length is great but they\\'re not worth the price b/c by the 3rd or 4th wash (cold/perm press) holes have already occurred. i\\'m very disappointed! yes these are pretty & cheaper than other extended length yoga pants, but honestly, the pairs i\\'ve had for years from alloy.com & longelegantlegs have stood the test of time with no holes thus far so i guess u get what u pay for! just returned from 18 day trip to europe including a med cruise and wore these daily.  they\\'re terrific!  tons of pockets with secure closures--enabling peace of mind for their contents.  one day it poured and we all got drenched despite rain gear and umbrellas--but these pants dried very quickly.  i only did carry-on and didn\\'t have a lot of clothes with me.  these fold up very small, weigh very little, and provide convertibility (to shorts) as well as a non-metallic belt.  i wish i could find similar ones without the convertibility though.  unsure if the zippers would work well in airport security.  overall: love these and glad i bought 2 of them. great pants. perfect fit! just what i wanted. but these last week and try them on. love them!! very comfortable and true to size. i definitely plan on buying more. love them! a tad long because i am a short girl but totally worth the price!! more so teal vs green in person which is totally fine with me! fits great;) i really love these pants! only problem i\\'m having is they are made for someone who is 6\\'4 no lie they are super long im 5\\'7! other than that comfy and soft! i have never had such a fun pair of pants.  the only negative is that when i wear them, everyone asks me where i got them. they are so comfy and cute as it gets! she loves it and she looks pretty in it. i bought her several of them and she is always comfy and cozy. i had to dress up as one of an elf for a holiday christmas party...this outfit looked good on me. being a muscular and fit...this outfit made me look as a buffed out grand master elf not a whimpy elf. overall, the outfit is nice....but i think the price could have been at least 15 dollars cheaper. i ordered a small but they are still a bit long for my son who stands about 5\\'5&#34;. i will hem them and they will be fine. i am 5&#34;2 and a size 7 in pants so the medium fit perfectly! i ordered them for a hip-hop dance performance i was doing and they were really comfortable. i had to roll them down instead of having them high waisted like the picture because the waist was a little tight and i wanted to show a little more stomach. they will be great to lounge around in now that my performance is over. these pants are stylish, versatile and they just look so good on me. excellent quality fabric. i\\'m 5\\' 8&#34; and i have to wear them low in the hips to get the right length so my only complaint is that i wish they were an inch or 2 longer. i bought two colours and i am tempted to get more. i wish i bought the 2t, 3t is a bit loose. so unlike reviewers who say it runs small, for me it probably runs true to size. asides that, works well. these pants are exactly what i was looking for to wear with tunics and sweaters. they fit as i expected. i\\'m 5\\'4&#34; and 102lbs. i\\'m typically an xs or 00 so they\\'re a tad roomy in the waist but not by much. they\\'ll certainly work with long shirts. the material is great and can be dressed up or down:) love them! they fit true to size. i wear a uniform and hate khakis but i would buy these again if they were available. first of all, these pants came out of the washer and dryer without a single wrinkle.  they fit well and are not to long to wear with a low heel.  they are great for a casual party and will go with a lot of different colors.  very inexpensive. excellent pants however to small for the person, great quality clothes for the price. if snow pants are what you are seeking these are really good deal and great item. the material is on the thin side so not good for winter, but they are a great play pant for around the house. great yoga pants that move well & keep you looking good even when you\\'re not in a yoga class. added plus is they stretch if you gain 10 pounds you can still have a great fit! these pants fit better then i expected - the length is just about right, and fit well.  even though i am done having kids i think that these would also work well for someone who is looking for a pair of pants that would fit through most of their pregnancy and then after with a bit of streach.  they feel like they are good quality materials and have washed well without shrinking.  i would definitally recommend these pants and will be buying more soon.  the shipping was pretty quick too. great for lounging or for being outside in cool weather. these pants are great for working out. i also love them for just everyday wear, these are even good for base under your jeans! really like these workout tights, thick enough for outside but not too hot for indoor workouts, just feel like a second skin but enough coverage to not feel naked, so comfortable.<br /><br />i dont have a perfect body, i have a little more in the tummy than id like but these dont roll down or make you sweat. its one of the best options out there for gym n running tights. amazing pant, great quality these yoga pants are very nice quality and very comfortable.  they don\\'t get baggy at the knees like ones made from cotton-stretch.  the short length was perfect (i am 5\\'0).  i highly recommend these yoga pants. love these leggings. qood quality, nice, comfy material and the mineral wash looks cute not tacky like mineral wash sometimes looks. i had ordered same brand mineral wash pants but in the yoga pants style in medium (my usual size)  before i ordered these. im 5\\'9 130 lbs and the yoga pants fit but were definitely snug but looked good on. so when i ordered these i ordered a large because i was getting them for work and everyday wear not just working out so i didnt want a superrr tight fit legging. the large was perfect for what i wanted them for, they were defenitely a bit loose for leggings but thats what i wanted. they are definitely long leggings like they are described. im 5\\'9 and they are plentyy long for me. not sure how a 5 foot girl would do in them but i saw ones from other seller that didnt say long. i think t.party might offer different lengths bcuz the yoga pants i ordered came in 2 different lengths. purple were really long (which i liked cuz im taller) and olive were standard. so i would def check on lengths b4 ordering if ur worried. definitely ordering 2 more pairs (im kind of obsessed, i love good leggings and they are extremely rare to find without paying an arm and a leg). i think im gonna get one pair in med and one in large because i want the mediums for working out or for when i want a more snug fit. oh yeah the colors. i ordered these leggings in black and the t party mineral wash yoga pants in purple and olive. all the colors are really nice but i especially like the olive and black (olives really nice if u like earthy tones, black is not a really dark black, more like a grey black, which is to be expected with mineral wash and purple is a deeep purple, i was worried about purple being too bright but its not, its dark. i like it the only reason i regret getting purple is bcuz i love them so much and want to be able to wear them on everyday basis and feel like i dont wear as much bcuz they are purple). btw they\\'re yoga pants are also by far thebest fitting yoga pants i\\'ve ever had, they dont flare out til way below the knee and are veryyy flattering. now with all that said, i was surprised that they dont offer an xl size because i know im on the slim side and if im between a medium and a large that doesnt leave to much room for bigger girls but it loks like they might be newer cuz not alot of reviews so maybe they will in the future. sorry that was kind of 2 reviews in one and really long just didnt want to leave anything out. hope it helps! these pants are the most universal pants i\\'ve ever owned. need some longer pants to sleep in? boom. need to get a good pump in at the gym and want to hide your legs when it\\'s chest day while getting a good leg sweat? boom. wanna go around town and be &#34;that guy?&#34; boom. the material is also super soft and breathable, i wear these pants all the time. i need to get more! finding long pants is already an issue with being 6\\' and a 36\\' inseam. i was skeptical about them being \\'long\\' but they are just that! and really comfortable, even morw so than my yoga pants. wish the bottom was a little wider, but overall exceeded my expectaion! im very happy with my pants, pretty color,made good..they were shipped and arrived as said they would ,promptly. they fit so good and they are so comfortable.i am glad i purchase this  product.and they came before they said they were  in the mail. it was a great a buy!! was so cute and fast service love the quality i am a big minion fan and i love these.  they are true to size and they are comfortable.  love them. i bought 2 pair and like them. i love these sweatpants my mother calls them mommy sweatpants, but i love them.  yes they are huge and really baggy, but i love them.  i ordered a medium and they are huge (i wanted them that way).  so a small could have fit me, but i wanted them big for when i run in the really cold weather this winter.  bottom line is they are really nice and true to size. my husband loved his new pajamas.  they\\'re true to size and very comfortable. comfy awesome pants.  i\\'m a 36w and 32 length so i orders the large/short pants. fit perfect.  i previously ordered the large/regular and they were way to long had to send them back to exchange. these pants fit just as i expected. i plan to purchase a few more colors. i would reccomend them to my friends also. these pants are great!! i\\'m 6\\' tall and wear a 16/18. these were long enough and very comfortable around the waist. i wore them to yoga this week and they were perfect! i will be ordering more colors soon! really lovely fabric!  press easily and beautifully--grey shade is lovely!<br />good length pants that can be used--day and night!<br />nice. great pjs for the price! these does run big. i wear size 4-6 pants and my legs and hips are bigger than most people my size, but the small fits me perfectly. i don\\'t exercise in these. i just use it in conjunction with my anti-cellulite essential oils. these pants helps me sweat even when i am just lying down on my bed reading. definitely work well. i only wish they made an ankle-length version. washed well, nice and soft, no peeling so far my husband loves them perfect besides the bottom of them lose fit comfortable and very well made these are a very good pair of shorts, they are also very comfortable. these are my favorite leggings! they are so soft and so comfortable and stretchy! perfect fit! in love with them! i love these pants!!! i\\'m a 6ft thin built female. i normally get larges in jogging/pj pants due to length being an issue. omg!! length is noooo issue here lol. these are hella long. i hope they shrink some actually when i wash them. mind you, i wear a 37 1/2 inseam in jeans. lol these are my new favorite sweats! love the fit and color. will shop again these are.extremely comfortable loved them so much i bought another pair lol... great buy thanks :) my fold over cotton spandex lounge aka yoga pants fit perfectly and just as expected.  i\\'m only 5\\' tall so i knew i\\'d have to shorten them, which is worth it, as they\\'re so comfortable to wear and teach yoga in. it\\'s difficult to tell which will be too small or too big.i usually go with the larger size. i chose a medium. that might have been a mistake. love it perfect for hiphop for my daughter. much too small.  i had to return item.  pj\\'s were cute and appeared well made i love them, really comfortable, appealing, was as i expected but the seam started to come undone. this to me is not that big of a problem, i can sew it back up like its supposed to be but it was where and when. the seam had come undone in the crotch area. which again in this time young women feel comfortable with wearing leggings as pants. i get it that i don\\'t sit like the average female but sitting in &#34;crisscross&#34; fashion should not cause the seam to become undone. when this occurred i was in public. if my friend had not said anything to me about that, i would have created a very  embarrassing scene indirectly. there was no sign that it was going to happen it just did. i do adore them and have the ability to fix them but, i\\'m in a way disappointed. this shouldn\\'t have happened.. these stretch rather well for having a cotton inline.. great for a cooler day, but wont make you sweat if the weather gets warmer. fits right. they\\'re like nylons. theyre short and roll up, thighs rub together i\\'m a pretty petite woman so even the small is far too large for me, but i love these anyways. i\\'ve had them about 4 years now, they aren\\'t soft anymore, and have a few small paint stains but i still wear the hell out of them and probably will until they fall apart. they\\'re the perfect lounge around pants. i loved them. the fit me perfectly well and the colors are nice too. i bought this item in burgundy and i haven\\'t worn it yet but i love the fit the style and the look, the color and style is a perfect versatility for summer business attire with a blazer or cardigan of course then after business drop the blazer/cardigan and relax, i would go for a ballerina slipper if certain businesses don\\'t go for open toe sandals or shoes i have ordered several pairs of these bdu.  pants . they are the most comfortable & convienient pants i\\'ve ever purchased !i will recommend these to anyone male or female for work play or just being comfy !!!!!!!!!! plenty of pockets great colors ,they dont shrink & are size you order,lengh is great to.i have gotten lots of great comments on them !i work outside all the time at my job & love to hunt & fish so i truly reccommend them !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! for every day wear for work these pants are, durable, light and very comfy for men to wear my hubby tells me. they fit. la talla es perfecta, el detalle en las rodillas lo hace muy original, la entrega fue rapida, el pantalon sin ningun tipo de detalles y el precio muy bueno these pants are adorable and durable.  the fabric is soft and they look good with everything! these are great pants! so soft, and nice quality! also, the color is &#34;thunder&#34;, so in a way, my kiddo\\'s wearing thunderpants! am enjoying my jerzees 9 oz sweatpants.  they\\'re comfortable, warm & fit close to size.  i pay a little more for them than other sweats because they have pockets and i\\'m lost without pockets to keep my junk in. i was looking for something like this to wear under a short dress and it fits me perfectly. i don\\'t recommend it to wear it alone as a short though... these pants fit me very well around the waist and legs, but were several inches too long. they work well when i wear them with trainers. they are extremely comfortable and i would buy another pair. perfect very nice set it fit perfect and it washed very well. of course he grew out of it before it wore out and that would be carter\\'s. they fit well and are comfortable. the material still looks good after being washed several times. they are also the perfect length. they are really comfortable and fit me which is rare since i am only about 5\\'10&#34; and ....middle-aged belly-ish. as some have mentioned they are a bit &#34;see-through&#34; when backlit but i don\\'t care about that. haven\\'t washed them yet so can\\'t say how they will fit afterwards. being cotton i am assuming shrinkage, but they could stand to be a bit shorter. they bag out quickly after wearing, but i think a washing will take care of that. i bought these with another pair in a different pattern and noticed a slight difference in length but i am used to that with inexpensive clothes from asian countries. i chose this rating because i do like it but the material is just a bit too thin but still using it i\\'m 6\\'2\\\\\\\\\" at 186 lbs. with a 35\\\\\\\\\" waist. i was unsure which size to order based on size chart and reviews. i went with the xl. the waist and length was a perfect fit! they are made to fit a little snug but they are not \\\\\\\\\"skin tights\\\\\\\\\". the pants arrived in only 13 days from the uk. they seem like a quality product. i\\'ll have to see how they hold up after some usage. i don\\'t think you\\'ll find a better pair of pants for this price. i would not pass these up for other \\\\\\\\\"name brand\\\\\\\\\" pants. i was unable to track the shipment but that wasn\\'t an issue for me. thank you the only pants i can wear with my three wolf moon shirt - all other pants catch flames from too many ladies rubbing against.[[asin:b000nzw3iy three wolf moon t-shirt, available in various sizes]] my 4 year old daughter uses these at night instead of a pull-up (expensive) and they take up to 500 years to decompose in a landfill.  anyway, she is a stout 40 lb girl and it was hard to find something that would work for her, other cloth diapers don\\'t fit her shape, this is great!  i just add in a cloth insert and it keeps the bed dry all night long.  she is a sound sleeper & a moderate to heavy wetter. wonderful fast delivery. they go perfectly with jordans and they fit you as they should. not too baggy but just enough to give you that perfect jogger look finally, there are yoga pants for men! as everyone knows, it is practically impossible to find yoga clothing for men in such a sexist industry. fortunately, however, american jock has produced comfortable, well-made, attractive, and affordable yogi pants. i hope that these are only the first of many to appear! i strongly recommend these for any serious practitioner who feels out of place in baggy basketball shorts. these pants are decent. i am 5\\'7 and weigh 120 and i got a small. they are shorter than i was hoping. i could never wear wedges or platform sandals though, only flats bc they go just above my ankle. i bought these for back to school.  they are very comfortable and easy to maneuver around while being in the classroom.  i would definitely purchase more! my son wore these pants everyday for 4 months and they held up very well.  i washed them almost daily with a little bleach and they looked new.  the padding and adjustable waist were great.  i recommend them. these pants arrived looking like they have been used.  they are supposed to be a gift, but they arrived in just a poly-mailing-envelope.  there was no inner packaging.  there are no labels on the pants.  and the white band looks pretty grungy.  it\\'s just weird.  i\\'m not sure if i want to return these or not.  otherwise they look nice, but don\\'t want to give a gift that looks like i picked it up at a yard sale.    update:  coridu contacted me right away about my seller-feedback, and said that they would fix the issue.  it was very polite, personalized correspondence.  they sent a return label to me, and were supposedly sending replacement pants.  i\\'m still waiting on the new pants, before mailing these ones back.    final update:  i did receive the replacement pants, but get this: they came in exactly the same packaging (or rather total lack of packaging that the first ones came in ... er ... not in).  so without tags or packaging they still look like they were bought at goodwill or something.  not appropriate for a gift.  they do fit well, and look nice.  but as noted, they are super long (even on a 5\\'8\\\\\\\\\" medium-build woman).    so i\\'m giving them 4-stars based on their customer service and a decent product. they look really warm and well made. i didn\\'t order the right size for my self. love them i love them!! it fits me because it is made from a stretchy material, but for a large person the plus size is better. i am 5\\'3\\' (size 6) and the length is right. i first got the standard size color red, and then just ordered a pink. truthfully, i do not mind ordering one of each color. they are beautiful, sexy, and very feminine. they feel like a long skirt with two elephant trumps and hanging tails at the bottom. i tied up the tails to make them shorter when i wear flat shoes; otherwise, they will drag on the street. they are cute but the material is a polyester (medium thick, not shear like some other belly dancing pants that i bought), not cotton. however, for the price, you cannot expect much. overall, they are good multi-purpose pants for groceries shopping, yoga, beach walk, dancing, or around the house. they are very comfortable. i just wish they would make them in cotton because it is better for the skin. only hat i would put on my newborn. love the softness and quality of kickee pants. love the print but smaller all around than previous releases. size up! color is excellent, but too tight and too short. perfect yoga pant bought these for my wife.  she loves them.  they are a comfortable and have a nice waist band to hold them up, and a very loose fit across the legs.  not heavy or overly warm.  they are thin and in direct light, somewhat see through. item was a bit large but to me its allright received quickly and was exactly as stated in description. love these pants. they are so comfortable my fianc√© loves them! great pants and i love the pattern. always get compliments. great fit fits well, like the slim legs. the fabric could be softer, it\\'s a bit stiff/scratchy, but i have somewhat sensitive skin. good long length. great buy! they look great and are comfortable and easy to use. these are very soft and good quality for thin,flat fleece. i was looking for plush, or fluffy fleece and these are not at all. these are thin like jersey cotton, only made of fleece.  they are soft and airy, not like the &#34;cheap&#34; chinese fleece that allows no air and are a bit rough on the inside.<br /><br />so if comparing to other thin flat fleece, they are really good. but by the description, i thought they were fluffy or plush and they are like tshirt-thin.<br /><br />as for size, they are pretty good for online. i am an 8/10, 8 looks good,10 is more comfortable and i bought the xl and it is perfect for pajamas. i could have fit in the large for sure but the xl was a little baggy and just what i wanted.<br /><br />i am 5\\'4 and they are perfect, a little long but not too long. i saw a question about the waist, they are absolutely normal waisted pants for anyone over 30....they are not &#34;low-rise&#34; in any way, whatsoever. under 30 yrs old might think &#34;normal&#34; means low rise but over 30 usually think low rise is &#34;low&#34;! these are not low rise. amazing pant! great for work! plenty of pockets and have held up great so far. a must have for anyone using them for tactical purposes. cute! the product fit a tad bit large in me. i\\'m 4\\'11&#34; and 100 lbs and ordered the xs. however, i anticipate some shrinkage in the dryer. i will update this review upon washing them. the reason why i gave the review 4/5 stars is because they fit a little big.<br /><br />this look is definitely not for the faint of heart. you really have to want these because they really have a funky-posh-hipster vibe to it. the draping at the hips are not subtle--but that\\'s the beauty of this product! the pants are well-made, too.<br /><br />love this purchase! beautiful fit = long enough.  extremely comfortable.  go to pants.  fit just as expected. these were cute but on the small side. i used to love vsx sport, but they seem to have been discontinued. now i am happy! i was forced to look  elsewhere and i found these!!  you know what\\'s one thing i love about these?  they actually fit women who have a booty!!! thank you thank you thank you!!! plus of course, great length and perfect fabric! please dont change these! the most comfortable thing what i ever came across, i\\'d recommend it to everyone! it\\'s a true pleasure wearing it. match the oneies i purchased. loved these pants but i ordered an orange color.and got red. they fit as expected ! want to order a second pair eventually i like my jeans to be fitted. i usually wear a size 7 but i got a 9 to be safe and their kind of snug but no to the point of not breathing. i think they fit alright. they look great too! love these! came on time and fit and look exactly as pictured/described. these pants are very tough and are able to withstand my 9 year old! he can tear up a pair of china-mart pants in one day. one thing is that they ride a bit high on the waist so if your kid prefers low rider pants, these are not it. also, make sure you order 2 sizes bigger than what your kid wears - these run small these slacks are excellent for the office. they are very comfortable and very dressy. with the permanent crease, all you have to do is hang them up as soon as they\\'re dry, and no ironing is needed. i will definitely be ordering more colors! these are the best belts they last a very long time.i was always buying belts for all three of my boys i couldn\\'t find hulk in stores so i checked amazon they had it i love this app love them and sleep in them too. i like it and good for the travel use it and more like real life something and fit long leg cover made good sleeping i put save in the lauagge it these training pants are perfect for boys or girls. they have the little front pocket for boys and still fit snug for a girl. they are made of thick layers of cotton so if an accident occurs it is soaked up well, but they still do leak because they are made of cotton. however, if they do leak, they feel it quicker rather than they would in a diaper, so in addition to everything else, that makes them great potty training pants. i bought these in all sizes and colors for my grandson. they are the softest most comfortable pajamas you can imagine. i wish they made them in adult sizes and i would be a matching pair for my son. love them! i love these yoga pants! they fit perfect, with the right amount of stretch! i live in these! they don\\'t lose shape after 20 minutes like most do. i will be ordering more since we decided to potty train our daughter on the fast track (the potty boot camp), i knew pull-ups were not the way to go.  we tried them for awhile, but they are pretty much like diapers, and it was too easy to forget about potty training.  we bought these training pants in size 2t and also a pack of the small potty patty training pants.  she is about 27 lbs and will be 3 yrs. old in less than a month.  they both fit her well, but i think the legs are a bit tighter on the pattys(which might be a problem if your son/daughter has chunky legs), and they seem to be slightly more absorbent than the gerbers.  the gerbers seem to be more comfortable for her, though.  we used the pattys more the first day or two when she had accidents, and now we\\'ve moved onto the gerbers for everyday.  make sure you wash these before wearing, or it will not soak up anything!<br /><br />update 7/30/2013:  my daughter is 5 yrs old now, and somehow she is still wearing these underwear!  i don\\'t know if they stretch out really well or if her little butt hasn\\'t gotten any bigger, but the underwear have held up very well over the years.  is it weird if i pass them on to my next daughter?  i kind of feel like every child should get their own underwear.... great lightweight cargo fatigues, very similar to my original nam fatigues. only problem is the zipper. low quality or just not done right. teeth do not mesh well. so i am stuck with the zipper at half way down. so lightweight you feel as if you are wearing shorts. originally bought for paint balling, but since i have used them for camping, hiking and bowling! you can\\'t get lost.  they are comfortable and fabulous! i used it for zipline and a woman said in my back &#34;the best thing is that you have to wear these pants&#34;. obviously she did not know it was my pant-skirt. i take that as a compliment! they are sooooo comfortable! i want more of these! the lace-up pants are made nice, look great, and are comfortable. a good value for the money. i recomend these pants. these pants fit alright, but they were way too long.i had to hem them up because i assumed that if i bought them in a smaller size, they fit tighter, but still be too long. the pants are fabulous and wish they came in more colors there is a good amount of info. there r enough pictures of the product. wonderful gift idea for males of all ages. have not gotten product yet. comfy and geeky! does it get any better? it looked great on our niece.  i bought a bigger size, thinking she might need to grow into it, but it seems it runs smaller in sizes. so make sure you buy a size up from your child\\'s original size. i liked them, good material good look.<br />oh and extremely comfortable.<br />i thinking of buying another pair.<br />get one for yourself i bought these for my grand daughter and she loved them !!!!! these are rothco pants, as expected. unlike some rothco gear, these pants are perfect. they fit amazingly (i bought large and i\\'m a size 36 waist), bdu pants are cheap, strong, and long lasting. i just received these, so i can\\'t tell how the colors will hold up over time yet, but i suspect they will retain it nicely because of the poly. the pattern is exactly as it should be, no random groups of one color, and their is an equal amount of each. i suggest you pick up a pair and try them for yourself. you really can\\'t find a pair of pants that are more comfortable.<br />i will try to update this review after about 10-15 washes to let you(s) know how the color holds up. sister in law loves it!!!! i\\'d buy it for any baby in my life over and over and over again. fits well my daughter loves them so nice i like it small price but very wearable and comfy. i ordered two more. i am 5\\'8&#34;, 160 lbs. normally wear pants that are 34-35&#34; inseam (very long legs) so  i ordered a 13. they were too short! they are very cute and would\\'ve worked great, just too short for me. after i got the first pair i immediately ordered pair #2. these are great! excellent , i really look forward to meet the year of the horse (2014) wearing these on me, wish me luck! you would not believe how many compliments i get on these. they are soooo cute i absolutely love them. they are true to size and look just like the pic. it is nice and smooth like i expected. because i am a very petite i need to have it shortened which costs me 18.00 $ more than the price of the gaucho. do you think in the near future you can cater to petite like me? given as a gift.  recipient greatly appreciated. i love these scrub pants! durable and stretchy with loads of pockets! i\\'m so glad i purchased this.  used it on 2 pairs of my jeans and it worked perfectly.  i probably added about 1\\\\\\\\\"-2\\\\\\\\\".  it comes with an attachment so you can hang dry it.  i attach the smaller opening to the device and then hang on my shower rod.  definitely worth it.  way better than using those button extenders. great great price for fr pants. they run a little small in the waist  i wish i would have ordered a bigger size. maybe i just need to lose weight i bought these for my husband a month or so ago. since he put these pajama pants on, he hasn\\'t wanted to wear any of his other comfy pants. he seems very happy with them, even though they are very long. one of the best products i have ever purchased online. great pants and extremely durable. the 8 pockets make the pants stand out and are also very useful. the ties at the bottom of the leg let you tighten the ankles and keep them from dragging. the pants won\\'t discolor or rip at all and are sure to last a really long time. perfect fit didn\\'t ride down not tight but fitted cool sassy i love them so much want to buy more i love the great, smooth feeling and design, got many compliments. the only thing that happened to it was a little hole that was made by my kitten crawling on me but i still wear and love them. :) i tried these looking for something for my son to wear to bed.  he is almost 100% day-trained now, but at 3 1/2 he still wets enough at night to soak through pull-ups, and getting his bed wet upsets him.  these work well for containing overnight leaks and i would buy them again.  the one frustration i had was that one pair did melt in the dryer as other reviewers mentioned.  i only bought a 2-pack the first time around so this was aggravating to have happen the first time i washed them.  i was able to save the other pair by drying them inside-out/ inside a lingerie bag, or allowing them to air-dry.  overall i prefer spending the money on these than disposable bed pads, not to mention all the extra laundry i was doing (pajamas, sheets on a near-daily basis).  plus they seem to be helping my son with his confidence about potty training, and that\\'s the most important thing to me. thank you so much for sending the pants along.  my son is nuts for these.  he is a size 7/8 and slim so the small worked out well.  i was a bit nervous at first because they looked like they were going to be too big.  nothing a belt can\\'t solve.  he is in about the 50th percentile for weight but 85th for height so we have pant fitting problems.  if your child is 50/50 these pants will fit just fine.  if your child is 85/50 then you should go the next size up and hem or roll up the pants. i think these are awesome. my little girls is 2 1/2 years old and i was having trouble getting her to go potty and now she wears these she goes to the potty on her own now. it took a couple of weeks but everytime she would pee in them she didn\\'t like to have them on. so after a couple of weeks she started going on her own. i would highly recommand this product. waist is ok, legs are really long, had to use alteration service.  i am 5.6. medium normally fits me ok. these are really soft! see-through so once you put them on they look more cream colored due to the thin material. they are really long too! i\\'m about 5\\'8 and there\\'s still a little extra length/material around my ankles. i really like them though! they\\'re comfortable. i put them on just to try them out and kept them on all day!! go grab u a pair!!! i absolutely love these pants!!!!!! i ordered them in 3 different colors, and every pair fits perfectly! the legs were a little long, but that was expected as i have read in previous reviews. i wish they had more colors available! i would absolutely recommend these pants! i got a large, i\\'m a 32\\' inseam with a 35 waist, the expando waist is great will fit anyone, they are also extra long, probably a 36 inseam so it will fit a bunch of sizes. i got them too big so i\\'m returning  them best sportswear product out there hands down. these are just a tad long on my tall kiddo who is normal weight, so if shorter and normal to thin i would order the size down. perfect fit. especially the length. i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; and they fit perfectly. actually bought another pair .great quality, comfortable and airy. i\\'m in love with them i was looking for an inexpensive, basic yoga pant. the fit and length is good; the pants were a little more flared than i expected but overall what i wanted. just bought my first pair and i have to say wow! material is great quality and very comfortable. i owe other compression pants where they tend to slide down a little.  these pants are very low rise and stay in place. wish i could wear these everywhere if it was more acceptable. i wear a thong just to be sure the package doesn\\'t show.  just ordered  a couple more pairs. please n2n, don\\'t stop making this product! adorable! washes well, very comfortable. love my sweatpants i wear this everyday i workout with my red marines logo shirt! when i wash it it stays the same as i bought it nice feel too..lol! excelente!!!! the party starts when i walk in with these on. the pants were better than expected.  the quality was ok.  i liked the fit and length. there light weight but nice perfect! love everything about them. couldn\\'t ask for any better shorts. especially the price. will order these again! a must buy!!!! very thin material. gets small holes easily. extremely comfortable though love these pants. confortable i love it, is a bit too long, but i\\'m short so it shouldn\\'t matter, the fabric is fantastic and overall, adorable looking!! it fits just perfect!! this outfit is just fabulous, i am five feet one 120 pounds and the fit was just what i wanted. for the money these pants are great. i ordered the taupe and the color was just beautiful, the material has a sheen to it, i will wear five inch platform heels with mine it makes you look so sleek, no flip flops for me, getting ready to order another color. i was worried because  my order was not here as promised, but it did come that monday, and amazon did talk to me after contact through ups tracking great short set i forgot how polyester in pants will cling to your body and pick up every possible piece of lint or cat hair in the house.  otherwise, comfortable. how could you not buy them? they feel like a baby receiving blanket. very comfortable pants that look good. great find! very stylish! good awesome. :) i love these shorts under mini dresses and skirts for extra support. i would not where them alone, unless you want to show all your business. but you can not beat the price. i have washed them and they are still in great condition. i am a full figured woman. i where a 12/14 in womens and they fit me great. don\\'t hesitate to buy. it\\'s very cute i like it i ordered three pairs a couple days ago and to my surprise i received them today. easy transaction, speedy delivery and product as described what else can you ask for? thank you! great somewhat big but super cute and she can always grow lol üòä i like the fabric and printing but the size is not for s to m these are really great pants! i ordered the short length, which was perfect for my 5\\'4\\\\\\\\\" height. i normally buy this line of active wear at target, but decided to try an online order as my local store did not have my size in stock. i am soooo happy that i tried it! the material of these pants is a little thicker than any that i found at target, which is especially nice in the colder winter months! additionally, this brand\\'s sizing can be a little off at times, but i found this product to be accurate. merchandise is very durable. seller was very prompt with delivery. very comfortable. according to my teenager &#34;spandex&#34; are required for most sports. i got tired of paying $30 for name brands so i ordered a couple of these. though not as shiny or as fancy as namebrands she is ok with these. these pants fit my 2 and 1/2 month old perfect. i especially like that the bottom of the pant legs can either be rolled up or down making it so that they don\\'t rid up the babies legs like many other baby pants do. i love these. i wear them like every week. i wish they had more colors. exactly what i expected durable and will last a very long time. quite baggy around my waist if not worn with belt. has extra material in the knee area which was unexpected. they have laces at the anckle so you can tighten. great pants. i use for paintball couldn\\'t live without these petti pants. great in the summer under dresses. better than a slip. i purchased these after reading a bunch of reviews. i am 5\\'4&#34; and i currently wear a size 14 in most things. these fit well. however, i have to agree about the elastic in the waist being a bit snug. i have a small waist and bigger butt so once i got passes the butt it was fine. super comfy and looks cute even with my curves. i was worried the fabric would make me bottom heavy but it certainly doesn\\'t. if you are expecting a high quality garment do not purchase this. i would say you get what you pay for, a unique item of mediocre at best quality. but great for the price. so soft! does not attract dog or cat hair&#60;3 love it! very comfy. i bought for my use ar my zumba class now i bought 3 more for the girl because they love it thanks these jeans are a very nice change from yoga pants when you want to wear something comfy but presentable.  i plan to wear them the next time we fly because they are that comfortable and decent looking.  if you have white or light furniture you will need to wash them 2 or 3 times right away or the dye will transfer to your furniture.  they run slightly long. great material. got a size 5 yr for my daughter who wears a 4 because they run small. the size comes as a 4-5yr on the tag. the recipient of these pajama pants loved them and remarked how soft they were.  always nice to hear when you are buying a gift for someone you don\\'t really well. these pants fit like perfection. they give you a bit of a classy look depending on what top you put with them. they seem extremely slimming as well they\\'re awesome & made out of quality material. the color was on point. i think i will be ordering at least two more pairs these are my favorite new leggings! they are fun and easy to wear. i did detect a oder like plastic when i opened the package but after a quick wash (gentil cycle) and air dry they smell fine. they fit magically and very comfortable (i am 5\\'2 125) i don\\'t think they are too thin, because buying them i expected them not to be thick like winter wear. (it is winter in maine here) worth the money, i would recommend and would buy again! i ordered fhese in \\\\\\\\\"little cat\\\\\\\\\" and they are honestly adorable. the only thing i dont like about these is that the cats have little upside down black crosses on their foreheads - but that is entirely in my own fault, as i did not check for close detail in the design. still, they\\'re leggings with cats all over them. mother****in\\' cats - how could anyone not love them? other than that they\\'re cute. the material is a bit itchy for me compared to some other leggings i own, but they might be better after a wash or so. i have a big butt so they\\'re pretty thin for me - i might have to wear cute shorts over them since when i tried them on my underwear was visible. but no biggie for me, for some people it might though.<br /><br />other than that they\\'re very cute :) my only issue is that they\\'re itchy but ill wash them and see what happens. got here pretty quickly! i ordered them on christmas and got them today~ like them i got these based on the positive reviews here, and everything people have been saying is true. furthermore, when i was walking down the street, a guy in a lab coat stopped me, saying he needed my help because he had a time machine set for 1984, but needed someone who would blend in after traveling back. needless to say, i accepted. i will see everyone in -25 years! these are my absolute favorite leggings. amour has many great items to choose from.<br /><br />these leggings are stylish and a great fit. i get alot of compliments. and they fit just right. i\\'m 5\\'4&#34;, 115lbs, 36-28-36. they make my ass look awesome!<br /><br />i got tired of the boring plain typical leggings sold here in the us. (boring!) and the ones here sold in the us fit the typical average woman\\'s body. i have the atypical body, small waist, big butt. so it\\'s hard to find pants or jeans to fit me right.<br /><br />i bought every design by amour.<br />thx!!! awesome!! these were very cute and fit excellent but the fact that the crotch and waistband were flat made it look odd when i wore them with anything besides a super long shirt. all together it was a cute pice of clothing and very versitaile, if it just had some sort of zipper or anything on the front it would have been a 5 got these as a christmas present for my artsy teen.  nice quality of fabric - not see-thru.  and boy do they make a statement.  i\\'ve not seen any like this in the chain stores, and people routinely stop her to ask where she found them. these leggings are gorgeous!! i got them for a mermaid costume and they work great, however they say they fit between a small and large. not so i wear medium size leggings, and have a 27.5 inch waist (on most days) and 38 inch hips and these barely fit. the elastic barely makes it over my underwear line with pulling them on as far as they can go. they are skin tight which doesn\\'t bother me but for some that may be a turn off. so keep in mind the &#34;small to large&#34; is in asian sizing, so beware. love the fit very comfortable comfy, thin material, good for summer. shorter than i would like, but i\\'m 5\\'8&#34;. i wear size 32 30 jeans so i ordered the medium regular and the pockets for the knee pads are way to low. i will try medium short and see if the knees line-up better. they are a still great pants. l o v e  nothing more to say :-d nice addition to costume collection.  comfortable.  :) got these for my best friend who loves working out! she is going to be thrilled to have them! thank you! i love the brand. i love the fabric. i love the quality. love to put my son in these when we travel so light weight and breathable they are perfect! i bought these when my daughter was about 4 months old and they were ridiculously big on her.  she is in the 90th percentile for height and they went up to about armpit level on her.  now that she\\'s almost 9 months they fit great. they are very soft and  comfortable for her.  just order down a size if you want your baby to wear them now. fit as expected. i recommend i got these slacks in record time...good value for $$ they wash well and no wrinkles if hung up from dryer right away. love these pants! üòä i just wish they had better color options! love the flow! fit perfectly. button up fly so no zipper danger my brother love sponge bob and they are so hard to find. so i bought these for his birthday. he loves them and they fit as expected these are great, versatile pants.  i was impressed with the softness of the fabric.  they fit as expected an actually look very good on my son. i particularly like the color options as they match many other clothes we have so closely that you would think they were purchased together.  excellent buy! so happy with these! was pleasantly surprised by cottony soft feel and stretchy comfy quality! the colors are awesome! very good value. bien these pants are so comfortable that i have to make myself not wear them everyday. i get lots of compliments also. very nice fabric. love the two full pockets in the back. a little long but not a big deal for me. i really like these pants. i am 5\\'5&#34;, size 8-10 and the medium fit well. i especially like that they have 13% lycra. they keep their shape well. i hate when they get baggy after a few hours or a workout. highly recommend. these are obviously comfortable. they\\'re yoga pants. and everyone\\'s butt looks fantastic in yoga pants (even loose yoga pants!) didn\\'t need any other reason than that to order these but the price didn\\'t hurt. i really like how these fit.  they hug your body like a second skin and the pouch is relaxed yet supportive.  the pouch supports your genitals from behind, cradling them out and away from the body, very satisfying.  the fabric is very soft and warm.  they fit comfortably under any pants, dress or casual.  personally, i wish the waste was a bit higher; they ride a little low for me. i had a pair of skeleton tights that broke the first day i got them. i was so heartbroken that i decided to never trust another company and spend my days crying. until i found these of course :d! i was a little nervous about the fit since i have really long and thick legs because of a brazilian background, but i found that these fit perfectly! it is true that they are a little bit see through, but personally, i wear these under shorts and with skirts, so that won\\'t be a problem. the bones are the only see through part though, but since the pelvic girdle is... ya know.... where your panties go, i would make sure to wear some white tights under them if you enjoy wearing leggings as pants. they stretch well and fit comfortably, and are indeed worth the money. the quality seems nice, and if you have long legs, go for it because they stretch to conform really well.<br /><br />oh, and they arrived four days early! i bought this for my 2.5 mo. baby. it fits, but it fits big, with room to grow. the material is very stretchy and soft, it will work for many more months. its really cute. the only thing i might say is that the color is a little different than the picture. its not that pale of a pink. great pants got a pair of southpole as a prank and liked them but wanted some without dumb stones on it, got these to lounge in. fit good. the material can be a little see through if stretched but should be ok if just for fashion. cute.  fit.  shipped quickly. they fit they are just little short i love the fit, style, color, versatility and i bought all the colors! i am well satisfied with the way they wash and retain their shape. color does not fade. cozy for home but i look like a nerd if i tried wearing it out.. great deal for the price. so soft & breathable -- great for florida babies! these leggings are nice, i am 5\\'1 so they are a little long which causes the pants to not be so tight on the legs which looks a little strange. these will be cute for going out- love them besides they are too long. i love these pants and love them so much i went back and bought 3 or 4 and different styles and black tops to go with all of them. absolutely love all of these and the fit around my waist and legs and thighs are great. they are quite long and so i have to wear 3 inch heels for them not to drag on the ground which is kind of a bummer sometimes. but it doesn\\'t stop me from loving them or wearing them! bought these for a special occasion, however, the pants are super comfy, wear them anywhere and everywhere. get lots of stares, but i think that a good thing. the sizes are a bit large and a lightly tight fitting, overall great product, little pricey tho. these rain pants are very versatile, we just love them! they are very durable against rain and even snow. my 3 year old wore them on a snowy day and slided with no problems, they kept her warm too ; thanks to fleeceline!<br />adjustable straps on shoulders and bottoms are very useful too. highly recommend them!<br /><br />west new york, nj great pants, comfortable and soft! fit as expected and super cute on! would purchase again, as the price was excellent! i love the material. looks exactly as on the model. color is great. it does seem to run a bit more snug than i expected. and i actually have other clothing from this shop (i have their long leggings in the same size i ordered these in, and they fit perfect), so i ordered the same pant size i ordered last time, but you could probably easily order a size-up in these. they were really tight. i\\'m going to try exchanging for a size up. fits well. pants were for my grandson who loves them. they are well constructed and a great looking pair of pants, awesome i love my shirt could not be happier ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è best training pants i have ever seen.  very thick to help contain accidents during those first few months of training.  i love that they went as low as 19 lbs.  my daughter is very small, just 18mths old, so we needed something that would fit a little one.  most training pants are for 3 year olds.  i love the choice of sizes and the ability to feel confident that even if an accident happens that we won\\'t be ruining any carpet! great lounge pants, nice soft material, great screen printing, washable, non wrinkling, love these pants!!! i like it. the idea of this purchase was to put together a costume & i think it\\'s perfect for it, n not even that... now that i have it in hand, i think it\\'s great to wear on a daily basis. i\\'m obviously not sure how long it\\'d last before it gets messed up, or how it\\'d look once it\\'s a bit worn out. but it looks good as of now, n seems to be able to handle use for 6 months or more if you\\'d wear it often.. also depending on how you\\'d take care of it.<br />but for now the one i purchased is going to be used for the costume i have in mind n it absolutely looks prefect for that matter, n i\\'m sure it\\'ll last a couple of years, since i\\'d be wearing it once, maybe twice a year.<br />the fit is great. i\\'m between size 32 to 34 [mostly 32]. in this case i got a 32 n was wishing for it not to be too tight but to be fit. it\\'s more of a regular/slim fit, like it\\'s in between the 2, so it\\'s exactly the fit i was looking for.<br />the price is decent for what you get n i do recommend it if this is something you\\'re looking for ; ] i love this jumper! its very comfortable and cool. its a little long for me but the fit is perfect. i am addicted to these wonderful things. everytime i wear them i get compliments. :) i had a pair of yoga pants that i loved for about 5 years, and they finally got too worn down to wear anymore about a year ago. i have been looking for a new pair ever since, but nothing in the stores was ever what i wanted - just a simple, good quality, affordable pair of yoga pants. i finally gave up trying to find any in stores and searched on here. the price wasn\\'t too bad, so i gave it a shot. these are seriously perfect! exactly what i was hoping for! i\\'m 5\\'4, so they\\'re a little long, but most pants, especially yogas or sweatpants are like that for me, so it\\'s nothing out of the ordinary. great great great pair of comfy pants! (: these are great.  very comfortable.  had them for over a year.  don\\'t shrink like all others. i am ordering again. i love these cute palazzo pants.  they are comfortable and perfect for my upcoming maui trip to cover up after swimming.  i would have given them five stars, however they are super shear.  beware!  if you intend to use them as cover up pants over swim wear, they are great.  the thick waste band almost covers the vital parts, but not enough.  also, they were a bit long on me (i am 5\\'3\\\\\\\\\" and 110lbs, ordered a size small)  so i was about to cut the bottoms then i had the bright idea to wash them first.  i am very glad i waited because they shrunk up in the dryer to the perfect length. love these. satisfied i\\'ve been wearing these for a few months now and there\\'s no noticeable wear and tear yet. i wear them to the gym or to lounge around the house. they fit perfectly, i love the fold-over waistband, and they are super-duper comfortable. def plan to purchase more in the future! these are by far the most comfortable pair of maternity pants that i own.  i should have bought them one size smaller though, because they are really big...but i figure they will fit throughout my whole pregnancy. perfect!!! love these pj pants. this one is actually for a gift, so i hope they fit. i have two of my own a hufflepuff and gryffindor and they are the most comfy pants i\\'ve ever worn. item just as described. i love these pants. i\\'m 6\\'4\\\\\\\\\", and male and tend to carry quite a bit of stuff. (wallet, keys, phone, sometimes eyeglasses, notebook/pen, calculator around the house, secureid for logging into a data service etc ... you get the idea). jeans are out, too constrictive. pants with large front pockets are out... 6\\'4\\\\\\\\\"... so when i sit on most chairs, my knees are higher than my hips causing everything in my front pockets to spill out ... solution: cargo pants (it also allows me to put stuff in different pockets so i am not rummaging through 1-2 big pockets looking for stuff - i\\'m a nerd). most popular retail brands make cargo pants that fade or fall apart or feel flimsy after 2-3 washes. i have 2 pairs of camo propper pants that after washing 2-3 times to soften them up straight after purchase look the same 1 year in as they did after those 2-3 washes, are sturdy yet comfortable... and the only reason i am buying more is people make (incorrect) judgments about me due to them being camo, and i love them so much i wanted some neutral colours (hmmm, what shirt should i wear to dinner at \\\\\\\\\"bob\\'s\\\\\\\\\" place that goes with camo? :) ). it\\'s certainly not that the other pairs have worn out... not at all!    i would add though that choose your vendor carefully. amazon has a table that shows that most vendors ship rather promptly but one vendor takes days to process your order (guess which vendor my order went through?). i submitted my order 3 days ago and still do not have a tracking number, and when i contacted customer support for an update, the response was terse at best.    in short, great pants, and remember you have a choice of vendors through amazon, so choose wisely if you expect these in a timely \\\\\\\\\"fashion\\\\\\\\\" (pun intended). arrived ahead of schedule which i loved.  good pants for office setting and they have pockets (very hard to find).  also, i\\'m 5\\'2\\\\\\\\\" so these where just the right length. i love these! i will say that they are a little bit see through, as the material is very thin.  i actually wear them as pajama pants and they are awesome. well, the wife loves it.  bought it for her.  she says it\\'s extremely comfortable. a+ fit great as a plus size pregnant mama and three prior pregnancies, it was time to treat myself to a new pair of maternity pants. it is also very frustrating being plus size and pregnant trying to find something that is fitting and comfortable.  next to sweatpants, these are the next most comfortable maternity pants ever.  i would highly recommend these to any expecting mom. got these for work..comfortable..legs are not straight which i prefer..more of a boot cut i am going to order a couple more pairs for sure! the fit was great, just a little tighter around the waist than expected. however, it wasn\\'t unmanageable. loved them. i like the material, style and color.. i wear a size 6 in most everything,,,but this fit more like  a size 4. i\\'m a size small, usually a size 1 in pants and they were a smidge loose in the thigh area but other then that they were pretty good well made. holds its shape well, stretchy yet firm hold. teal is a beautiful color. wish the fabric was a little thicker though. these are great for yoga i\\'m sure but i used them for maternity pants as they are way more comfortable these pants do work up a sweat when working out..even just wearing then around the house doing house work...the only thing i don\\'t like is that they smell rubbery but i\\'m sure it will come out after i wash them..they fit as expected and seem to be good quality material ..good construction on the pants too...they are lime green on the inside of the pants which i was not expecting but is nice so you never put them on backwards! super slimming... my daughter stole mine! need to buy another pair, the black pants are a great quality. looking to get some more colors... thought my brother-in-law would love these. i was right! he is a fan of &#34;the big bang theory&#34; and was delighted to receive them. ...now if only my baby weren\\'t on a long potty pause! seriously though, i love these.  they\\'re clearly made for ec (which is why some parents looking for trainers aren\\'t liking them...though i feel like toddlers could learn to use them, but it would be different than learning how to push down underwear...on second thought, it might be easier for a toddler to un-velcro these and flip them back for a potty!) they make holding baby up for a potty-tunity so much easier and putting the diaper on super easy.<br />anyway, my only complaint is that the waterproof ones, which are the ones i grab for most often, don\\'t come in fun designs, too, or in more colors, but i know it\\'s because it is a sahm and not some big factory.  also the reason they are (unfortunately) a little pricey, but so worth it in my opinion. these are fun lounge pants.  like the message on the top!  nicely made and very comfortable! there a little tight, but i like them, and where them all the time. i ordered these to wear under my costume on halloween since my dress was a bit short. i got a bit nervous when the holiday came and they\\'d yet to arrive, but then the package appeared on my front porch just hours before i was set to go out. as others have said, the shorts do run a bit small, but i\\'m 5\\'9 and 120lbs, so small is a good thing for me. i believe mine are a medium, and they fit perfectly, though i probably wouldn\\'t wear them just by themselves. very slim and not bulky, so they\\'re perfect to wear under dresses and shorts, or maybe over tights for dance. i\\'ve also been wearing mine with a t-shirt to sleep in. all around great purchase, especially for the price. great sevrice just cute and  adorable fit for a young girl these pants work well especially if you don\\'t like pants that are low cut. the  legs are straight and the material is easy to take care of. wash in cold and hang dry. keeps shape and doesn\\'t fade. i will re-order -this time in long vs. x-long- my inseam is 34&#34; but i needed to hem these 2 inches in. i could live in these!! sooo comfy and cute!!! great!!! the material is a bit think, but they are so comfortable and fit amazingly. cute casual beach wear. love them!!!! when i first saw them i didn\\'t think that they would fit. being 5\\'1 with larger legs from lifting weights, i was convinced that they wouldn\\'t make it past my thunder thighs, but they did!!! they are also not as shiny as they look in the picture, which to me is a good thing. i am going as sandy from grease to my senior homecoming and thought that these would be perfect. great they are comfortable. great item, price and quality. daughter loves the pants.  waist fits as expected & legs are a little long, but not so long that she is tripping over them. love the pants,perfect length it\\'s hard to find footed pants in larger sizes.  these are wonderful.  they do run small, so get the bigger size.  worse case scenario your baby will grow into them. we are so pleased with the soft new pants for baby . they fit very well and wash very well my son is 14 and in high school.  i ordered these just for practice.  i thought they would be longer but overall they fit good.  received order promptly! these are incredibly short and i wouldn\\'t really recommend wearing them out unless you are exercising. they are very soft and comfortable. the bottoms to not roll up and the top is not tight enough to cause a &#34;muffin top&#34; but still stays in place nicely. our teenage son asked for these for christmas.  he loves them.  washed in cold water and air dried so there wouldn\\'t be a problem with shrinking.  looking forward to wearing in them in the football locker room and weight room. love love love these pants! comfy and perfect. just make sure to buy a size smaller than your reg size perfect fit, great feel and the perfect amount of stretch. they have a cottony soft feel. they\\'re all i want to wear on days off. i love this sweatpants they are amazing and super comfy and warm. the color is perfect go tarheels! defn a good buy! i ordered these because they said they have a gusseted &#34;crouch&#34;, (even though i am sure they mean &#34;crotch&#34;), because pants with a single center seam cut me in half, forcing me to wear a leotard or some seriously strong underwear to protect my crotch. i hope these do the trick! just ordered my second pair as they fit like a dream and the yoke at the hips/waist make a smooth fit. if they made more colors i would be buying them as well. the slacks are correct length & fit perfectly. appear to be well made. i have bought alfred dunner slacks in past & i am very satisfied. slacks are sturdy & last a long time. love them! i love this brand! fits great!!  i\\'m not thin and these still look great on me the fit is great.  love the light, breathable fabric and it has perfect drape.  only complaint was the croch seam was a little weak.  took 2 minutes to reinforce, no sweat.  i love these pants. i loved this. i was very happy to received it. exactly how it was described. it fits me very well and it is very comfortable. i love it! thank you! i couldn\\'t believe how comfy these pants are!! the love how i can wear them with just about anywhere! i normally throw them on when i got a long day of running around to be a comfy as i can.i got the small size and it fits like a glove no extra hanging or balling up either. plus the i got them at was hard to beat, will buy again but in a different color/style.these pants are worth more than you pay! i bought these for my boyfriend, who is pretty tall & lean. the large size fit him really well & he says they are really comfortable. i need one size smaller/// thanks the description states that this garment has \\\\\\\\\"water repellent treatment\\\\\\\\\". that is entirely false. you can tell just by looking at it! it\\'s made of polyester and it has a soft feel. however, i didn\\'t want to assume and a visual inspection might not be sufficient. i sprinkled some water on it and it soaked right through.<br />besides this obvious lie, the garment feels very soft and comfortable to wear. i got the medium because i\\'m a medium in most garments. i\\'m 5\\'7\\\\\\\\\", 145 lbs. like most guys i don\\'t have massive legs. i wouldn\\'t say  they\\'re scrawny either because i work them out due to knee issues and physical therapy requirements. i mention this because although these aren\\'t running tights, they are form fitting. if you prefer your pants loose or if you are any bigger than me, i would suggest getting the larger sizes.<br />i\\'m overall satisfied with this product due to the price and comfort. another reviewer said that he paid a lot on shipping because it\\'s shipped from overseas, but i only paid about $5. my order was fulfilled by \\\\\\\\\"sportsshoes unlimited\\\\\\\\\" i purchased four of these and they r just as expected...very nice and good price...i usually am a medium but i was hesitant prior to the reviews on wat size to get...everyone says to go down a size cause of the length but mine r perfect...i\\'m 5\\'0 and 115 lbs and the medium fits just right!!! i need to go to the dog park daily in all kinds of weather. these pants are warm and wonderful, and they arrived right before a major snow storm-perfect. my skirt leggings are wonderful. very nice good quality love the pants!! he loves them!! doubles as a scarf. lol i would like to buy a few pairs in different colors!  they fit well and are very comfortable! got these for my daughter...she loves them and plans on getting more. love these pants!  i thought they\\'d be way too long, but with my wedges, they\\'re perfect.  if i want to wear them with flats, i\\'d probably have to have them hemmed.  i\\'m 5\\'3 and ordered a size medium.<br />they\\'re super cute and comfy!  i might order more in different pattens/colors. these are by far the most affordable, attractive slacks i have ever bought online. great material, feel more expensive than they are, true fit. i bought one pair and after they were delivered, i bought two more pair. great for work, love the wash and tumble dry. i am in love with these pants!!!  super comfy and can wear as dress or casual. the pants were a little too long.  washing and drying to help the fit because they shrank. i like it!!<br /><br />size is good, span is good and price is the best.<br /><br />but when i received this, it was already run in nylons. i am in love with these pants. they fit great and are incredibly comfy. they were a bit too long for me, i\\'m 5\\'2, so i cut the bottoms off and left the edge raw, no need to hem! love how they move got the shirt as well, to wear together under the snow suit. kept my baby warm and cozy in the cold weather. love that it is pure and organic wool, i do not like polyester on my children\\'s skin. i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; and 121 lb and the fit is very good and the pants are super comfortable.  these are very high waisted but i fold them over and wear with long shirts and tunics like the picture so you can\\'t tell.  the fabric is soft and not shiny and the elastic is not too tight at at the top.  the colors are pretty and i\\'m happy with the purchase. i don\\'t usually write reviews but i was compelled to write this time around. these jeans are the truth. i love it so much. it fits extremely well and makes you look very good from the back. since this was my first time ordering these brazialian jeans, i decided to get help on what size to buy from customer service. well, ms. gleiry was excellent! she wrote back within minutes. her input was on target and greatly appreciated. the shipment also came really fast. i would buy more jeans from her for sure. thanks gleiry! lightweight and comfy enough give for yoga for real. i am 5\\'6&#34; and weigh about 135-140 pounds. these yoga pants are a great fit, huggy but not squeezy tight. ok fits well but upper thigh is looser than expected fun amazing product. fits perfectly. i absolutely love these pants! they are cute, comfortable and warm! they are ideal for cold weather. i want to buy them all! i have already bought another pair. i bought the acu pants for paintball and they work great for the rugged terrain of the field that i play at also i would definetly reccomend these pants if you aren\\'t looking to spend over $50 for actual paintball pants they seem really nice and warm.  like i said above i haven\\'t worn them yet and i don\\'t know if they will stretch like the thinner summer leggings. great pants but girlfriend is slim and we needed to exchange for small , original size we ordered was a medium.  she might need a xs but hopefully not.  she loved them though. i love the pant  fit and the style...what i didn\\'t like was this color.  it looks gray but it not. it came on time, although fit a bit small, it still fits because they are leggings, the attached skirt is super cute and not too mini afterall i am 50 years old, and it looks and feels great to even wear to work with some boots. thin and soft and sweet. pretty color. i accidentally threw it in with a hot load and it got pilled on first wash, but it does say to wash cold, so my fault. i will pick off the pills and have her wear it until she grows out of it, which might be a few days because it is small. its good qualiti but small for me. i ordered a second pair after the first arrived.  the first pair was a little bit short in the leg.  the second pair was perfect.  don\\'t buy the black if you have dogs. i like this product.  it is a good product.  i will buy this again.  i like this product.  it is a good product.  i will buy this again. i love these jeans. the rise medium & is not as low like the another brand i ordered from the same seller. i do not have to keep pulling these up, but even so, the front is u-shaped, about 3 inches lower than the back. i guess this is better for those of us who have a belly. my hips are now just under 37 inches (& my waist not much smaller). i ordered size 11 & it is just a little loose in the hips, waist & thighs. they fit ok in the legs, but i could have bought a size 9. it is so hard for me to pick sizes now that i have been losing weight by eating low carb on 12 hour work days, the fact that sizing differs so much between brands & the fact that i don\\'t have a waist & wear a much larger size top. i will try to shrink them a little. normal jeans are too thick & uncomfortable for me. these are so much more comfortable, stretchable, & not as heavy, while appearing very durable. i am 5\\'5\\\\\\\\\" & they are the perfect length. inseam is 31 inches. brand on tag says geso. i plan to order other colors in these. i only wish they came in more colors like dark purple & red. i think these go well with the tunics & dolman sleeve tops i have bought here (some i have also reviewed). both are very slimming, especially for \\'apple\\' shapes, whose weight is in our chests or stomach.<br />update: i just got 2 more colors in size 9. they fit much better, but still have a little room in the hip area. the dark chocolate matches perfectly a tunic i bought here on amazon: the azules rayon cowl neck tunic in dark brown. i also got the dark burgundy, which is a very beautiful color. very happy with purchase. beautiful!!! awesome! i am 160 lbs, i have thick thighs, and usually wear size 8-10 in jeans. i ordered an xl and it fit perfectly! and my boyfriend didn\\'t want me to leave the house because my butt looks so good in these pants!!!!! super cute! material was more light weight then i expected.<br />üéÄ üéÄ üéÄ üéÄ üéÄ üéÄ üéÄ üéÄ üéÄ üéÄ üéÄ üéÄ these pants are what i had expected and that\\'s always nice. i like that you can fold the material down for a low rise style or lift up for more support around your stomach area. love these!  i ordered 3 different brands of yoga pants and these were the best of the lot. great quality, soft material, and not see-through when you stretch and bend.  the photo isn\\'t entirely accurate because the pants actually are more of a straight cut, not flared.  fits comfortably at the hip, thigh and through the calf.  straight cut.  you can wear these to exercise class or the whole day for errands and feel comfy.  higher waist band is great.  covers the lower belly nicely and makes your hips and rear look nicer than low-rise styled pants.  upon delivery, i thought the pants might be a bit loose, but one wash got them a bit tighter and they\\'re perfect now.  liked this so much that i\\'m ordering another 2 pairs. pajama jeans were well-made, nice-quality material, very warm and comfortable to wear. excellent price. fast delivery! i ordered the striped ones, so i have no problem with them being see-through or worrying about my underwear showing through...these are so comfy!  i have a pair of linen pants that i\\'ve loved for years and it shows, they are nearly worn bare...so i was on the hunt for a new pair and i came across these....ordering clothes online is always sort of a gamble but i went for it because they are adorable!  i\\'m 5\\'4&#34; and i generally wear a size 8-10 jeans and i ordered these in a large and love how they fit.  they are loose (like linen pants should be), and the drawstring goes all the way around to make it easy to tighten them at the end of the day when they are feeling a little extra loose.  because i\\'m 5\\'4&#34;, they are a bit long for me, which is no big deal, i hemmed them myself, but i did end up having to take off 2 1/2 inches...these will easily replace my thread bare linen pants! i\\'m a 5\\'9&#34; & a ladies size 16.  i bought a men\\'s xl.  the length is a tad long, but they are pajama pants and if they shrink any in the laundry, it\\'ll be the perfect length. i love these so much! they fit well and i wear them under my white scrubs to work. the patients get a kick out of it. im a m size person, but for this one i ordered l for a &#34;just in case&#34; and it was the best idea, l works totally fine for me. its a super soft pajama. ;) i love them! super cute for exercising or doing errands. i\\'m 5\\' 11&#34; and they are just long enough. i was worried that this would have been a bit too shiny like others that i have seen.. but the shade of this legging is just perfect! not too flashy, not too subtle. i ordered the xl, since leggings normally run small and it was a perfect fit for my long legs and curves. i am 5\\'7&#34; and wear size 14. i would really recommended, they fix really nice. they\\'re very comfy, however they are extremely thin. also, mine came with a slight run in them. i am 5\\'6&#34; tall with a truly hour glass figure (big hips with broad shoulders and small waist) and these pants fit perfectly.  the fold over waist makes them versatile for just about anything you want to wear with them.  the only issue i had with the pants is that they are very long.  i had to have them hemmed to remove about an inch so that i could even wear them without dragging material on the ground when i wear heels.  but this is an easy fix!  the material is very nice and doesn\\'t wrinkle easily.  great product! i love it everything was perfect as expected. i purchased the pants for a son \\'s birthday and he was so pleased.  he said the material was high quality and they fit him perfect as he is tall.they came x-large and gave him plenty of room to do his exercises every morning.  yes, they were extra nice for the money.  they exceeded my expectations. fit perfect. needed something that wasn\\'t baggy and didn\\'t snag on everything. the fleece like outer material is quiet. these were too long for me, but very easy to snip to fit. no hemming needed for this type of fabric. so tired of spending so much on yoga pants.  these are perfect i love my new pants they fit perfect they show my little curves good i will be buying more different colors ordered a large. i\\'m 5\\'9 and 170 pounds and they fit perfectly but i\\'m not curvy so i don\\'t see a problem with them staying up on me. they\\'re light weight and a bit revealing but offset by the flared leg at the bottom. a slim woman could wear these and look terrific but so can a not so slim one. fast shipping a very happy with them. i\\'d recommend buying a pair especially for the price! cute suit but too tight on my arms fit well, soft.  i love the design! if you look at the woman within or the bco or roamans size charts, you\\'ll know that the large is 18-20, medium is 14-16, 1x is 20-22, etc.  so that handles the size problem people experience, they don\\'t realize that these plus-size clothing stores all are one size larger versus \\'normal\\'.<br /><br />secondly, color names and pictures are not always accurate;  generally, the colors shown are several shades darker than you receive.  here, \\'bluebell\\' is really a bright sky blue, also known sometimes as \\'cornflower blue\\'.  if you search on that term here in amazon on plus size women\\'s clothing, you\\'ll see the real color.  i have these pants, and that\\'s why i can explain the differences.<br /><br />washing and drying these or the 7-day pants, is wonderful.  yes you can wash warm and tumble dry low, medium, or even high.  i\\'ve done that on these and the 7-day (the latter i\\'ve had for years), and they do not shrink or pill. but these \\'sport knit\\' pants will shrink if you wash them in hot water and dry them on high cotton setting:  that\\'s how i got the \\'tall\\' version of these pants to shrink to \\'petite\\' (four inches shorter in length).<br /><br />the 7-day is somewhat better in quality, and i\\'ve never had any of them shrink.  some washers and dryers are rougher on clothes than others, so experiment by using the delicate cycle and tumble dry low, if your dryer or washer has proven hard on cottton knits.<br /><br />both types of pants can be dressed up.  i use the pants with a business blazer and matching top, for business meetings.  when the pants wear out -- which takes a long time -- then they make great knockabout pants.  very comfortable.  i must have 20 pair by now, and all are still useful for business. the elastic band stretches way beyond my waist length but also contracts comfortably to my waist. the only downside would have to be the elastic bands that contract around the ankles. love these belts very comfortable i\\'ve purchased two in black (wore out one pair), and one in the blue. the blue is more teal, but very nice color=-the teal looks really good with red and neon yellow and green. i am about to get the charcoal and garnet.  whoever said the material is thin--they\\'re right, but it\\'s good-thin, not cheap-thin.  the material is cottony, and has a comfy feel to it.  the drop in the crotch and back area is just enough--not too much! a +++++ on comfort level.  don\\'t even mind sleeping in them, taking out the trash, or going out.  i really like the waist--you can wear it high or you can wear it low--like lo-lo under the belly button ya know--say if you can get away with it--then go there--the whole nine--like jewel in the bb--i\\'m past that stage though lol! you can roll it or flip it lol! you can put your own style to it, like jeweled belt, sheer top with a colored strapless, put a cross body or messenger bag, and you\\'re on the one.  too high up looks a bit much . . . so i tend to wear it low.  with the legs, you can pull up below knee or wear over calf and ankle and fold at the bottom. the pockets are pretty deep, so you can jingle-jangle.  last, the size. if you are a chunky monkey, don\\'t go too small, and if you are a skinny minnie, don\\'t go to large--you\\'ll look like an oversized loose scrunchy, you know what i mean?  if you normally wear a xl like 12-16 you can get away with a size l. a 12-14 can get away with a m. if you are a size 18, don\\'t do it--get an xl. if you\\'re over that, try something different lol!  if you wear a 2-5 get an xs.  a size 5-7 can use a small.  in other words, you want them to fit, but not too tight and not too loose duuh!  okay, all these numbers stress me out . . .  omg it kinda reminds me of back in the day with the hammer pants!  very trendy for any age. good for working out.  looks nice if you want to be just out and about, with a casual top, even a dressy hip-hoppish top with some platforms--i\\'ve done it!  (i\\'ve worn trendy slip on shoes andflats as well as platforms (as in sandals look good). they look okay with pumps--but i guess you can take a chance and go there.) believe me, you will get looks--they\\'re just good looking pants simply put. people will look at you like--omg who does she think she is? btw these new hammer/ harem type pants look more feminine than masculine--too soft looking for a guy.  (but, if you know how to wear it--wear it. you can be bad all by yourself, look ruthless or look well plain or nurdy--again i guess you can take a chance.)  too bad they don\\'t make any that look like it\\'s for a typical guy tho, maybe with a draw string or something, cause i think a lot of guys who want to look manly but hip-hop would take the dive and try them . . . oh well.  wish they would bring back the nappy tabs, cause i wore those out too! i ordered a size 2 and it is too big for my child, but he will grow.  the quality is great, and i can\\'t wait to see him in it. so comfy ! great price and arrived quick a little big but over all very nice. i bought this as a gift for my husband to keep him warm while building on projects outside during the winter. so far they have worked well at keeping him warm, are comfy, and they fit as we expected. he also really likes the cargo pockets and is able to fit his wallet, car keys, and cell phone in them. we are happy with this purchase! soft, cozy, and stretchy! our little packer\\'s fan wishes she had about 5 pairs of them!  i would say they ran a tad small. great pants, they have room to grow.<br />good cotton and very cute in my little girl.<br />highly recommended at an affordable price. i am pleased with this pair of pants. they pretty much look and fit how i wanted. they are very comfortable and look good dressed up or down. i noticed that the left leg is slightly longer than the right leg on my pair. they are also a little too short for me, however, i kind of expected that since i\\'m almost 5\\'10&#34;. there is a good amount of hem to work with so i might try making them a little longer and more even. love the capri\\'s the watch looks pretty good- a little scratched up when i received it. but, it is exactly what i expected. great colors. it was a present for my boyfriend, so i haven\\'t personally worn it or know how it fits or has been working - but it seems just fine so far. it fits great.  will order again in different color in near future. these tighs will draw attention. my ole lady is very shapely. ok she\\'s fine as hell. the bone structure enhancement is crowd control. got a fine lady? get these...you\\'ll find yourself starring. i bought these for lounging and usually i wear a petite so these are a little long. i can roll them over a few times but they are still a tad long. they are a very lightweight material that is quite stretchy and would be perfect for those late spring days where the weather isn\\'t warm enough for shorts but you still want to be outside relaxing in the sun. very nice pajama pants. these fit perfectly and are very soft. i plan to order another pair. first, the fabric is amazing. it is very soft to the tocuh and very, very comfortable. the way it was described was exactly how it arrived. it was the size i ordered and it came with pants to match, which also has the same design. the delivery was excellent, i was actually expecting it in a few weeks but instead it arrived in about 6 business days. i will order from the bitablue again. thank you my girlfriend will pretty much live in &#34;yoga pants&#34; around the house. recently, some of her favorite pairs had gotten to the point where rips and thin material made them very impossible for even a quick run to the store. i\\'ve bought her a few different types and styles, and she liked these enough they i bought a second pair in a different color. she also can be somewhat picky about fit (these are skin tight, so i completely understand) and she actually does love these and finds the fit very flattering and i think she looks great. she wears a size 6 dress, just for reference. i have been trying to lose weight and my stubborn thighs weren\\'t going anywhere. after wearing the slimming capri pants for as little as a week, my pants are already loose! i continued my usual diet and walk/run workout and i am very happy with the results so far. i even dropped another two pounds! they fit a little larger than expected but i am not complaining. i plan on getting a medium next. i would recommend this product! looks great - feels even better.  two front pockets.  deep enough to hold a wallet but not much more.  i had been wearing jeans so i decided to add a pouch (on my belt) to the costume so that i could carry more. these pants are really cute but the waistband is a little bit too tight, making my belly look not as good as other kinds of pants do. i am a thin person, but the waistband digs a bit into my waist and makes my belly fat look like it\\'s coming over the edge of the waistband. the length of the pants is perfect for me. i am 5\\' 2&#34; these are beautiful and i look forward to getting rid of my muffin top so that i can wear them great material. better than expected. arrived on time. very comfortable and looks great. washes well. i love them though the size i got might be a bit big for me, these pants are cut very well, and don\\'t look sloppy.  very well-suited for work. i\\'m able to lounge so hard now thanks to these pants. they fit exactly as i\\'d hoped. i\\'d like seven more pairs. i really like these pants. they are a little bit slimmer made than the typical palazzo pants and the perfect length for someone of petite/average height. i\\'m 5\\'3.5&#34; without shoes. 130# and ordered a small. they are light and the design is great! they fit great and look nice however i wanted them to be heavier. but they are nice pants for what they are. thanks to all...wonderful i love having yoga pants in different colors besides black and gray.  :)  they are great and comfortable to wear. i have waited till these came back in mocha,  i gave only tried them on. taking them on a trip. cant waut to dress up or down with them. live love lve these are good quality, warm, basic sweat pants for a good price. the waist is gathered with elastic, no drawstring. waist is high. straight legs at the ankles - no elastic. length is good with waist band up at natural waist line (if you\\'re 5 feet tall).<br />would give 5 stars but i prefer a little more fitted shape, can\\'t beat these for the price though. however, i would suggest going a size up. i did not, and i had to send them back. i wish they would go on prime again so i could buy another pair. i am a size 2 but had to return for a size 4 which is really a 3/5 on the tag these pants are a great and flattering fit, and the wrinkles fall right out! so comfortable, too. these fit perfectly. i like tto wear the top as a regular shirt with jeans during the day. i\\'m 5\\'8 and the bottoms were an amazing length. so glad i got this just finished youth football season and my son wore these throughout.  boy are these great!!  i love not having to get the pads in and out every time they go through the wash.  they wore well and my son thought they were comfortable.  will definitely buy again next season.  he\\'s 10 yrs,  5\\'1, 104 lbs and he wore the youth xl. it is absolutely adorable the only problem is i ordered a 12-18 month and it\\'s just an 18th month outfit. this is supposed to be my son\\'s birthday outfit but the pants are way to big so looks like he\\'s only wearing the top with jeans wasn\\'t worth 30 i spent all together for the expedited shipping. very good, exactly what i wanted they were a little see-through and thin, but still nice. my favorite pants in my whole closet. that is all! i would wear them every single day if i could. i ordered 3 different pairs of pants this brand. everything fitst perfectly. true longest. i ordered a size s.  but i think in the future i will buy xs. visually jeans slim figure. i would recommend these jeans to all women.<br />i liked of all: &#34;u-turn jeans women\\'s basic skinny leg stretch cotton jeggings&#34; in terms of fit. but at the waist fit better &#34;u-turn style 381 - brazilian style butt lifting, levanta cola .....&#34; and &#34;u-turn style 1119 butt lifting, levanta cola, skinny leg premium french ...&#34; so i now have a few pairs of medelita scrubs and they are by far and away my favorite.  i actually look like a have a figure in them! i\\'ve washed them like a million times and they still look like i just got \\'em.  they seem pretty true to size from what i\\'ve found. i wear a size 4-6 and the large fits me only slightly baggy! that being said, the pants run super small but they feel great! i love the lines, the pockets, and the length. so cute best yoga pants i have bought! the pants are soft, comfortable and seem strong. the design is bright, and the size is comfortable (2xl) for anyone who is looking for even a possible 3xl size also. highly recommended. very colorful and comfortable.. great quality. i ordered these for my mother for a cruise we are going on and i am happy i order 2 sizes up. they look great on her. these are great, they fit all shape and they are confortable. me and my friend got the same pair and she is way smaller then i am and they fit both of us, no problem.  i get a lot of compliments. i ordered these in size medium & they fit just perfect (i\\'m a size petite), when i tried to order more of the exact same pants, they arrived 4-5 inches longer. this was with a gap of about 2 weeks or so. had to send them back. the ones i have are wonderful ans still feel comfortable & look good. had to laugh when my wife said &#34;boy, those are pretty obnoxious!&#34; they are really comfortable, so i wear them a lot. i got size 3-6 for my 2 moths old (she is 12 lbs) since so many clothes are running small, and i would rather buy items too big. anyway, they are too big but we are still using it already! just because those are the best pants ever! soft, warm, stretchy and have great colors. i\\'m sure she will be using those for few months. great buy, would recommend it.  definitely great baby shower gift. the costume looked really nice on my son.  he is very happy with it. these are very comfortable and well-made pants, look just like the picture.  however, the \\'rose pink\\' is really salmon, very attractive.  to see the exact color, search on \\'jessica london mixed stripe coral\\'.  i\\'m wearing the pants now with a similar coral stripe shirt.  they are so comfortable, i don\\'t want to take them off.  they are made of the same material and thickness, as the 7-day pants.  wonderful 2\\\\\\\\\" waistband is very comfortable, too.  drawstring has this little metal \\'catch\\' so it won\\'t disappear within the waistband.<br /><br />these will shrink a full size if you wash in hot water, and dry on high cotton heat;  length will shrink about 3-4\\\\\\\\\", too, so what were pants of the length in the picture, are now cropped pants.  if i wear them low, then they hit just above the ankle.  i knew that risk, and wanted that result.<br /><br />there are four pockets:  two hand pockets at the top, and one each on the sides.  each pocket is about the same size;  think of a size 8 hand with fingers spread out, to gauge size.  could fit two western digital 3.0 usb passport external drives sideways into each cargo pocket, and still have some room.<br /><br />so unless you plan to shrink the pants, order a size down versus normal, because they are meant to be baggy. now my favorite item of clothing<br />wish there were more subdued and modest color selection though a little small so tickled with this purchase.  i normally shop at the tangier outlets in williamsburg iowa and the price i got here was less than half what i pay there.  i knew exactly the quality i was ordering and they fit exactly as expected.  i have lost quite a bit of weight and plan on losing more.  didn\\'t want to pay full price for nice slacks if i was going to ungrow them.  but at the price i got and ordering through amazon it was a little more expensive than thrift shops and i can guarantee that the time saved more than made up for the extra expense.  this is one of the best purchase i ever made. good cloth i bought these for my daughter and she loves them.  they fit perfect.  they are so much better then anything we would have been able to find locally. fit and quality is very good. i love these! these fit true to size and are auper soft and comfortable. dress up nice with a tunic and as comfy as sweats, but soooo much cuter. it was hard taking these off as i wanted to live in them. they work for wearing to yoga too! i\\'m definitely ordering more colors. this is european sizing, folks. my wife purchased these. she is normally a size 0 or 1 in north american sizes. following the reviews and comments, she went to the surplus website and followed their sizing. based on the actual measurements she needed a size 38. they fit perfectly. the legs were many inches too long, but better than too short since they can be resized. legs, hips, and waist were great. avoid disappointment and check the sizing! great price, great product...certainly easy to get confused on the sizes. awesome material, comfortable, beautiful colour, veeeery stretchy waist band. excellent pants kid loves them! i luv these leggins. they r so hot. the give me a long sleek sexy luk. no dents cottage cheese.......horraaaaaay! i normally wear a 2x and these pull it all together comfortably! more colors pleeeeeez! where have you been all my life!!.don\\'t mind saying i\\'m almost 55 n these jeans rock!!this is my second pair,different colors and cuts.and i love both- true 2size can\\'t say anyhing negative..price is nice too...treat yourself today,you won\\'t regret very comfortable... i\\'m 5\\'11&#34; so they are a touch shorter than i prefer... but knowing they would be due to measurements they are great for comfy house pants. i loved these pants so much i\\'m about to buy another pair! sizing is pretty spot on. i am normally a size 6 (27 inch waist but can fluctuate up 29, so i feel stuck between small and medium sizes often) but going with medium worked out well.  the wide waistband is truly comfortable and i like the looseness around the bottom and thighs because they\\'re easy to move in and i don\\'t feel like my body is on display as would be with clingy leggings. i also like the way the bottom of the legs do taper in like leggings so the pants don\\'t ride up either. they seem to wash well also-- i always use medium heat to dry and haven\\'t noticed any shrinking. also they\\'ve got decent pockets. i liked these pants better than a similar pair i purchased because the waistband is truly wide so no elastic at the top to dig into your belly and the construction and material seemed of higher quality. good for the price will buy more we have had these for a while now, little girl like them, and wears solid tops because i was never able to find a matching top for it. look good fit good great to train in review for  frogg toggs pa83102-01lg pro action rain pants,...<br /><br />great price for the product / material.<br />they are purposely made large to fit over your pants, so you can adore them briefly while golfing through a rain shower, or just strolling in the park.<br /><br />great fabric, a little noisy to walk in.<br /><br />fit over the shoes nicely, in a pinch, includes velcro strips to cinch. they fit as expected they are super soft on the inside and fit me fairly well :) i\\'m satisfied my daughter loves these. it fit my daughter perfect!!! these are great if you are needing to go out and about and don\\'t want to worry about your little one having pee running down their leg at the store.  granted, if they do have multiple accidents in these they will eventually wick out the moisture.  my son is using the potty sometimes, but doesn\\'t really know when he needs to go potty.  if i ask him to try, he goes almost every time.  so these have be great in saving us from having to change clothes multiple times a day.  we have been using ours for a few months now and we really like them.  yes, they are a bit poofy, but are less so than a cloth diaper.  i would rather deal with poofy, then have to wash the carseat cover frequently.  also, my son is on the skinny side and weighs about 30-32 lbs at 29 months, but does have a little bit of chunk on his thighs.  we have both the size medium and large.  the medium ones are starting to make red marks on his thighs, but are not tight anywhere else, the size large fits just fine. fits great, very comfortable, you could wear these all day everyday they feel that good. would be an other pair i love these! very comfortable and great casual pants. could easily dress them out for a more formal night out. i hate skirts and this was a great alternative for a &#34;skirt-y&#34; look without the uncomfortableness of it! i love the \\'luvable friends\\' baby clothes, and these pants are no different.  the cuff fabric is a little thin, but is great when \\'cuffed\\'. they hold up well to washing, and don\\'t shrink as much as many outfits do.  i get these for hand painted, collectible, realistic (reborn) vinyl dolls that i do, and i can\\'t use anything that is \\'used\\' (even if in great shape, like some ebay items).  these let me send pants and shorts, as well as a onesie or t-shirt and booties without driving my costs up, and still get cute items.<br /><br />i\\'ve seen comments about things not fitting the age that is on the clothing label... baby clothing brands vary wildly (i\\'ve dressed more than 200 realistic dolls from micro-preemies up to 4t).  these fit their sizing chart well.  use the height/weight charts on baby and toddler clothing, and not the age of the child, when buying baby clothes ;)  a 5 pound newborn will fit preemie outfits in some brands, or gerber nb, while a 9 pound newborn may need 0-3 month clothing right off the bat.  always err \\'up\\' if in doubt- the baby can grow into something, but not shrink (hopefully !) they are of good quality.  these will be perfect for our son; who is a marine to work out in while he is home on leave. so comfy! make sure you get a size larger than you normally would. wonderful pants - we always get complements...i love the wide legs...so cute!  my son has about 8 pairs so far and he isn\\'t even a year old yet! cute nice cheap pair of leggings! decent quality for price i am around five six and weigh about 100 pounds (i got the small size) and these pants fit perfectly! they are a wonderful buy, very soft and lightweight. they are perfect for yoga, aerobics or theater work. the arrived very quickly and were in perfect condition. nice pants, my daughter is age 11 purchased adult small love the way my baby can move with this pants, they are so comfy and perfect for this chili weather. they\\'re adorable, comfortable and go with my sweater dresses perfectly.  i have to add more words here because 1 sentence isn\\'t enough??? i already had a pair of vogo yoga pants, so was happy to see them on amazon.  they seem to be well made and the fit is good.  i had to return the xs, which was too small/tight.  i thought i ordered the s.  they accepted my return, reimbursed me for my postage to return the xs and sent me a size small.  the small is still kind of tight, but very wearable, attractive and well made. i love them. very cute and different. i was immediately attracted to them. everyone has the purple but these greenish blue are to die for. they are a little snug at first but mine have stretched to a comfortable fit. i got these for my husband who works outside all day. he wears them under his work pants and loves them so much i have to get several more pairs. the lining in them is super soft and very warm. the drawstring on the waist is ineffectual and the bottoms of the legs are funkey but a great buy, especially for the price!! oh and we live near the ocean where it\\'s windy and cold and these pants still are great!!! my son is an airsoft enthusiast and he likes to &#34;go on maneuvers&#34; around our property after school.  these are rugged and realistic.  he is 5\\' 2&#34; and these fit him well.  they are very close to genuine marine woodland digital bdu\\'s. i purchased these for a friend\\'s twin boys and she loves them! she thinks they are adorable and the fabric is nice and soft so it won\\'t irritate the boys\\' skin. my granddaughter told me that they fit perfect and are very comy and she loves them. :) loved it! great for lounging around the house or working out in.  no pockets, so slightly inconvenient, but they\\'re very comfortable if you\\'re just chilling. liked the palazzo pants, my only issuse would be , that after the first wash , the color fades a little bit. overall, i\\'m happy with my purchase :) i will be sending this back for a medium.  sizes may run small as same type (other company ?)  sweat pants in a medium were too large. love kickee pants and worth every penny. every baby should have at least one pair of pjs. they are so soft and lightweight. my original package arrived on time and was just what i ordered.  after trying the pants i realized i needed a smaller size.  the pants were for an upcoming event and i needed the new size quickly. rick, the company owner, personally handled the situation.  he sent the smaller replacement without waiting for the original order to be returned.  i received them ahead of schedule.  good quality and great service. awesome it look nices, and the quality not as bad as i though. would but it again. very cute pants and we\\'ve washed them so many times and used them a lot. i would purchase again for my son. i am a size16 so i got a xl and they fit great. super comfortable. beautiful print and colors. fit great and very comfortable. lightweight. i was puzzled by the print on the bottom of the left leg. looked like a black haunted house and doesn\\'t match the rest of the fabric. still like, and wear them though. i already had neoprene shorts that were low waist, and it would leave a muffin line across the waist. so i got these for more coverage. it\\'s about a couple of inches above the belly button for me. covers the tummy completely. i\\'m 5\\'6\\\\\\\\\" 170, half muscles, size 10. even if not exercising much, these have a mist of sweat each time i wear them. i move freely in them, but too restrictive to try to stretch the legs far. i have lost 4 inches off the hips since this purchase, partially due to this capri pants. the fit is good. i usually buy large, but got a medium this time. the length is a few inches pass the knee. .. i don\\'t like the slimhot tag at the bottom of one leg. i\\'m not into clothes with large words on them. love this product. looks like a little tux. loved it! we bought the 6-12 month for our 3 1/2 month old 15lb, 25.5 inch baby and it fit well. it should be able to fit a slightly bigger baby too but i doubt a 12 month baby can fit. i like my fila\\'s their very comfortable , soft to the touch..!! they seem a little long in the leg\\'s, i am 5\\'9 take 32/32 in jean\\'s..<br />they arrived about 2 day\\'s ahead of the e.t.a..!! i would recommend them to anyone..!! i serve when i wear these!  can you say life????!!  these are edgy and fun.  love love them and i beat the scene when i rock\\'em...<br /><br />buy you some so you can get your liiiiifffeeee! the yoga pants are ok but they sent me the wrong color. i ordered black pants with the charcoal fold over portion. i received charcoal pants with a black folder. the pants are very comfortable though and my roommate ended up buying them off of me. like these a lot. these are great, simple, classy pants. these are perfect for casual and to just lay around the house with! they are super comfortable and i will be buying more! this tape did exactly what i wanted and what was advertised.  it held my pants firmly hemmed when needed and came off easily after use.  not a permanent fix but excellent for temporary hems. i love them, fits good i brought this for my 3 year old daughter. she is quite tall so i order a seize 5, which is what she normally wears, and was a little big on her.<br />it looks exactly as the picture. and my girl loves dora the explorer so she is the most happy whith her pants suit. love them, fit even better then expected, make my butt look sexy. i ordered one size up. love that they are made of cotton. light, warm and rugged.  adding the cargo pockets can be quite helpful when hunting. they are soft and comfortable and very attractive.  oddly, they have very little room in the bottom, given their name. if you have a flat butt, buy your usual size.  if you have a round butt, you might have to go up a size.  the flannel is on the thin side, which i prefer because i\\'m in california. item arrived on estimated delivery date. when i saw the pants it wasn\\'t what i expected. the color is more shiny and the material is kind of cheap looking. i thought its made out of cotton. also when i washed it the color came off a little bit. so be careful not to wash this pants with light color clothes. very cute but just a little small i absolutely loved these pants! even though they aren\\'t cotton, the fit and feel is still soft. i would recommend if you like this style to give them a try! great newborn outfit. really soft, nice color. like that it has the hand covers. i am 5\\\\\\\\\"8 & 160 pounds. i ordered a size large and they fit nice. very long to the ground. also i have a, how do i put this, large booty. my husband said the pants were very sliming & makes my booty look good too. i have these in three colors i love them so much. can not see through them, very stretchy. worth the price! :) please remember these are a one size item from china. if you are 5\\'-5\\'2&#34; tall and 100-115lbs then you are average size for an asian woman and these will fit wonderfully. if you are not petite by american standards then yes they will be too small. they are lycra as opposed to good high quality cotton. i can also see the seams coming undone after the first wash or two as the quality is a little lacking altogether, however for such a low price you can\\'t beat these for practice wear. i\\'ll probably be getting another pair in another color. gift for mother i am 5\\'3 and 105lbs and i ordered a medium because i have longer legs and they fit amazing! i havent put them in the washer/dryer which i dont think i will do. they are about 2\\'\\' past my feet so they have room to shrink. they do look a little see through but you cannot tell once they are on your body. these are just what i was looking for and hopefully will last for a little while! i like these leggings. they are not see through. which was super important to me. however, they fit a bit looser than expected  im 5ft 1 and 120lbs so i thought they would be tighter.. overall good leggings. i needed black pants for work as a bartender. i constantly need to bend, stretch, pick up things, move around fast etc. these pants hold up excellently! i love them so much that i bought multiple pairs and i like that i can transition from work to play very easily now. they are figure flattering at mid-waist with fantastic stretch. i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; and in dresses i wear size 6. so for these pants a size 7 fit me perfectly. good for baby with diaper. my daughter practically lives in these, she loves them so much!  thank you.  we would definitely order again and recommend. attracts lint continually. otherwise great pants. i bring dticky roller with me when i wear them. otherwise they fit nicely. sure scottevest is in some sort of transition. these pants are the the farthest end of the spectrum in the newer direction they are heading, and while very useful to some, these pants are obviously not reflective of the entirety of sev\\'s offerings.<br /> pockets-check<br /> shorts to pants-check<br />  colors/sizes-check<br />if they made these as stretchy as 5.11 stryke pants or even sev\\'s old flex hidden cargo\\'s, you wouldn\\'t be complaining i imagine. my teenage daughter loves to wear these under her white skirts.  they are short enough that they don\\'t show, too! these are adorable! they go perfectly with the kickypants dress. they flex and do not hinder movement. the dark color hides stains and they wash well. love these pants!  super comfy! fit as expected now wait for use in the winter when i go to vermont let see these jet black stretch corduroys are the most comfortable slacks i have ever experienced. right out of the packaging, they have the fit and feel of an old friend. i got them 3 days after ordering, they fit great, i\\'m 6 months pregnant & these are the only pants i am comfortable in, they are thin but it makes them comfortable. i love them. i got a small & i\\'m 5&#34;3 & right now i weigh 150 while they are probably tighter then a lot of people like i like them that way & they\\'re perfect. when i have the money i\\'ll be buying more :) the leggings fit and are not too short! the colors aren\\'t too bright and look just like the picture. perfect for christmas party! all they are advertised to be.<br />fully adjustable, belt keepers, quick detach clips, mid weight nylon, rubber-type shoulder pads.<br />all told i\\'m very satisfied and have had several guys with the uncle mikes style tell me they\\'re switching over next uniform allowance. heavy fabric... they did shrink a little when i washed them. well made, but a little too thick for strenuous exercise ideal fit with room to grow before school year ends, i will definitely commit to purchasing this brand from now on.... very durable very unique, i get compliments on these leggings every time i wear them. nice fabric and they\\'re holding up great. love the outfit, but wish pants were a little longer. love it! the service was very good and the pants were delivered in time. they are great for both indoors and outdoors. i had a trip planned to colorado and the stores in my area had been cleared out...all of them, seriously. i ordered this product at night(past 5pm) with only 4 business days-counting my departure date-and this product arrived one day earlier than expected. i was very pleased with this product...and warm for that matter. nice and warm. since the pants are for my son, i\\'m not absolutely sure of the fit, but a little large won\\'t hurt anyway...they\\'re p.j.s! good price for these pants. i\\'m 5\\'9\\'\\' and 185lbs. pants are a few inches too long, but can be cinched up with the velcro staps at the cuff. i\\'ve been satisfied with a jacket made of this material and am glad to have gotten pants to complete my foul weather gear. i\\'ve worn the pants a number of times...i\\'m short and the  pants are okay,but not as functional for me as i\\'d hoped they would be...i\\'d  have been better with something with petite measurements...with so much extra  material i feel it doesn\\'t look or fit  as i\\'d hoped it would..i was looking for harem pants, fit better than i expected. detailed review:<br />first off, i consider the fit to be somewhat large because i am approximately 5\\'1&#34; with a 28/29 waist and 37 hips so i usually fit a medium and sometimes a small; never a large. however, upon looking at the sizing chart i realized a size large met my measurements. they fit great. the pants actually cover my ankles a little and sit comfortably at my waist (i hardly had to tighten them with the drawstring). they\\'re not baggy on me, but not tight. i suppose you could say they\\'re a little &#34;loose&#34; (for lack of a better word); i have room to move freely in them. next the sweatpants are surprisingly warm. before putting these pants on i was a little cold in my baggy college sweatpants, now i\\'m comfortably warm. i also read on the tag that they are made to keep you dry as well; i didn\\'t see that in the description. finally, in case you were wondering, the side pocket is deep enough to hold my iphone 5s with pocket buttoned (only side pockets).<br /><br />now the shipping.<br />i thought it said they were being shipped from asia or something, but they still guaranteed i\\'d get them within my prime two-day shipping. the morning of the guaranteed delivery day i received an email saying the shipment would be delayed, but when i tracked the package, it was in my state; in fact, only two towns away. so i did receive the shipment on time with prime.<br /><br />in my opinion i think this was a great buy and i\\'m so glad i got two pairs (black and heather gray). all the other skinny sweatpants on amazon either shipped from asia, didn\\'t have prime, or were waaaayyyy too expensive for my college budget.<br /><br />i just hope they don\\'t shrink when i wash them...<br />hope this review helped everyone! please comment with any other questions! so many compliments!!! excellent in every way! got these for my dad for christmas.  he is difficult to buy for, and thought he would like these since he is a huge duck dynasty fan.  he loves them! will buy more when i have the money, i highly recommend buying these pants. i love the so much already. these pants are the best. i love and my husband loves me in these pants. i have 4 pair in different colors. it fits me well but it is little bit long.. im 5\\'3&#34; .. but its not an issue at all.. i look just like the picture in them. i read the one star reviews(always) and they said go up  a size and a half. so the large is a good fit.<br />they are very good for keeping your legs cool because they breathe really well. son loves them. fit great and comfy. these pants are great! perfect fit. no big poofy pockets sticking out the sides ( that\\'s a peeve of mine) these pants are actually much better quality than some others i have with characters on them. very comfortable and long enough too.  i hate the ones that ride up to my calf. very nice little soft outfits for babies. i love them. they look just like the photos and fit perfect. very soft and great quality! good fits perfect love these for the work i do not to tight slack for bending and just easy accessibility i was in the military, and back then, you got what size they gave you. its nice to buy something that really fits well, well made, and will last probably longer than i will i\\'d never had yoga pants before but needed a cheap pair for work to pass off as regular black pants since i\\'m on my feet all day i wanted them to be comfortable and these are! im addicted to yoga pants now thanks to these and i ordered the shorts as well from here and they\\'re even better! and they shipped on time and arrived on time too! happy customer! this is so comfortable. i use it as pants only. great fit.  plenty of room in the leg.  i love it. love! i\\'ll definitely buy more. i bought a xxl.  i was wanting a pair of cheap workout leggings, while i do not think these are the right material for the gym, they will be perfect for the fall under a tunic or short skirt.  when i took it out of the package i thought i had just wasted money and time, but it is a good weight and you cant see any imperfections or cellulite (not that i own up to having any cellulite.) fits great and it looks really good and sexy. it shows your behind so if you have a good one,you will make the guys go crazy with this outfit. i am super happy with it and so my boyfriend. it is good for something casual, like mall, beach. very comfy! these are so comfortable, they are great quality and a great price. i am highly pleased with these and live in yoga pants so that is saying a lot. decent bdu pants, extra layer on knees, cinches on waist.  front pockets not very deep, 2 large side pockets good, back pockets button flap hard to use.  color does not match the the military acu digital bdu camouflage shirt from same seller(daybreak), pattern same but dye is much lighter.  button attachment is not the greatest, recommend reinforcement before heavy use.  pants have metal zipper, not button-fly.  i am big guy 6\\' 1\\\\\\\\\" - 44 in waist, 2xl fit well, but legs not really long enough - will tuck into boots but would look high-watery in sneakers.<br /><br />all in all - serviceable. great for hunting/paintball. still think i\\'ll end up eventually getting a propper acu. adorable. they look red in the picture. but, they\\'re actually pink. great they run a bit long long so i deducted 1 star otherwise the quality is superior. you normally would spend much more for this quality. if they come back in stock get a pair or two before they are gone. the fabric isn\\'t as soft as i thought it would be but it\\'s really cute. the gaucho fit is comfortable. soft material. the leg length was long and had to hem them, but overall a good buy. good pants!  nice material that has some weight, wears well, yet breathes.  wrinkle resistant and wash well.  look fine for a dress up pant also. great quality! would buy again. accurate sizing. cotton / spandex stretches, and springs back when laundered. love this it\\'s so cute a little big, but adorable! they are comfy and look great. i bought these for my girlfriend and she loves them. she\\'s 5\\'2&#34; and has had problems finding yoga pants with a leg length short enough for her. the length of these are perfect. the elastic band around the waist is also superbly comfortable and does not dig into the skin. if we had the funds she would have a pair for everyday of the week. love these. they stretch in a million directions and bounce back. super soft and expand with your kid. i ordered a large thinking they would be perfect. yes they fit but it wouldnt hurt if they were a bit bigger good stuff! seems to fit great and not bad on the wallet. lets hope i don\\'t have to find out about the fire retardant cloth. cute! comfortable and well made yoga pants. they only get a 4 not a 5 because at 5\\'8 most pants are a good length for me. these tend to run long, which was a surprise. not just a little long either, but very long which disappoints for wearing them to or from anywhere. bummer! otherwise well made and true to waist size. great fit and solid price! we love &#34;taggies&#34; and wish they would go beyond 9 months.  fun clothing for little ones.  will buy more.  thanks taggies! i buy this for my girl and she like the pants,she like the style of it.<br />you guys should buy this too. the pants fit real good & shapes your butt alot better then most leggings. my only dislikes are they are darker then the picture showed & the outlines to make,it have the jeans look looks fake up-close. but overall am,satisfied w/ them. great price...great fit...fast shipping!!! i will purchase again. waaaaay too small. i am 5\\'10 and a size 14.  i ordered a 16 in these pants bc i saw they ran small. not even close. a size 14 would need a size 20 to fit comfortably. even ordering larger, there was an inch gap for my to button and zip. i just got mine today so maybe i hart put enough use into them but i loooove them! they arent too \\\\\\\\\"shiny\\\\\\\\\" and they may feel fake but def dont look fake. who cares??? they\\'re comfy and soooo cute! they look tiny but trying em ons they fit like a glove!! super comfy and make me feel sexy. im 5\\'9 and weigh 175 and the large fits me fine. i say order em girls. nice these are great because they\\'re so much like \\'real underwear\\' but are more absorbant, so when my son has accidents, it doesn\\'t run down his legs as quick. so comfortable!! after reading the reviews and browsing the user submitted photos, i just had to order some of these sexy pants for my man.  after all, ladies need eye-candy to spice up a relationship just as much as the guys do!!  i anxiously awaited the arrival of these lusty leggings, and hooo boy! they didn\\'t disappoint!  my husband has never looked as good as he does in those pants, tossing his mullet over his shoulder with pride.  the sheer manliness will take your breath away!  i quickly ordered several more pairs (in more colors).  now he can wear them with his favorite muscle shirt to the monster truck rally without worrying that he would spill his nachos on them(as he often does)!!!  ladies, do yourself a favor, and order a pair of these pants for your man!! i promise, things will never be the same.  just be prepared to keep an eye on him when you go to the pool hall, you\\'ll have to let all the other women know that he\\'s taken!!! o love them will order all colors only issue is the top. i would like to use a belt, the draw string doesn\\'t keep them that tight. very nice and warm, great foe hockey rinks as well. i wear these to the pool and the water parks. good quality, lightweight. only problem is that it\\'s too long. i\\'m 5\\'5 and these drag across the ground i never write a review but omg this dress is gorgeous i\\'m thick and made it stand out more i am 5\\'4 and weight 145 and i got a xl. so comfortable! these beat disposable pull-ups. the cloth helps my son perceive the wetness better. we have been using these for about nine months now and they work really well. it is important to dry them on only medium heat and not high/hot heat, because the snaps can melt on high heat. all of the pants in my wardrobe are mossimo and i was hesitant to try the &amp;quot;cuffed&amp;quot; capri--but they are great.  they are great for work, grocery shopping, or out on a date. even after two hours of a movie they keep their shape thanks to the strech.  i\\'m a size 16/18 and these pants made me feel very fem.  buy them, you won\\'t be sorry. awesome pants, sooooo comfortable, and freeing! nice comfy pajama pants, exactly what you\\'d expect. one word of advice, they do run a little large, but that\\'s also no surprise really in a \\\\\\\\\"lounge\\\\\\\\\" pant. fits as expected... soft material, body loving.. versatile.. definitely love the pants :) loved them. these yoga pants fit well.  they are well made, arrived on time and very comfortible.  i work out several times a week and they are very good to wear for that. i am 100% satisfied with my purchase. i\\'m five foot & curvy & it\\'s hard for me to find anything - especially pants - that fit me right. but i love these omg. they\\'re super soft & are able to be worn high waisted or folded down to a lower cut. they have pockets & are super comfortable. i can wear them at home or to a party. they\\'re seriously perfect. i got one in l and one in xl to compare. i\\'m about 5\\'8&#34; 150lbs and the l fits perfectly. i like how the xl has more of a drop crotch - there isn\\'t a big difference in size between the two other than that. they\\'re super comfy and i will probably be ordering more! very excited to find harem pants that actually fit me! my brother really wants some but i\\'m having a hard time finding one that would fit him. he\\'s about 6\\'2&#34; and 200lbs (he\\'s pretty average weight for his height...problem is finding ones long enough) so the xl is too small for him. if anyone could link me to some harem pants that would fit my brother, i would highly appreciate it!! ordered large for 34 waist, 32 inseam and fits correctly.  large enough to fit over jeans too. fancy pants. far superior to any name brand bought at retail stores. best pair i have had in many years. will be ordering more. high quality, great fit, very soft and comfortable! i want a few more pairs! my grand daughter looked very cute in it and her mother thinks it is great. she found it useful to wear under other sweaters, etc. it is very soft. it was difficult to put these leggings on the first time i wore them, but after that they were loosened up and fit perfectly! i guess they are just stiff out of the package.<br /><br />i am not sure how to wash them but i am just going to hand wash them so i don\\'t ruin them.<br /><br />i love these, they fit well and go with everything! i ordered these pants in the black and they are super comfortable. the legs were a bit long but they fit perfect. i wear the all the time! and the delivery was very fast. it only took about two weeks. this product is exactly what i wanted!  it was perfect!  i highly recommend this product and this seller!  thanks so much! i like the pants it fit me perfect thank you i bought these pants as a gift for my husband when he graduated army basic training. the pants came in a week early and were packaged well, no damage or missing pieces. my husband was very happy to receive them; he had to get rid of his old pair of tripp pants and these are his favorite colors. the only problem in they are much bigger than expected. i ordered a 32 and these look more like a 36. my husband is a thin guy but he\\'s pretty muscular and these pants almost fall off. i suggest being cautious about sizes when ordering these pants, but other than that they\\'re perfect. my husband wears his even though they\\'re big, he doesn\\'t really mind but i wished they\\'d been the actual size i ordered. got last minute for a praise dance my daughter had.  perfect fit. got quickly. i really like these.  they are super comfortable and create an attractive silhouette. i have bought 3 more, in different designs. these slacks are nice, but if one has a smaller waist and larger hips, the waist is very roomy; which is not a bad thing if one is thick-waisted.  they iron nicely and leave nice creases. i buy for my child, the material is quality excellent. maintain body temperature. great item. they fit perfect and very comfortable. elastic isnt the cheap stuff and they are very durable. love this product happy with this product. fits true to size and very comfortable. i have purchased additional products, and will definetly order again in the future. i just received this outfit, mailed from china, and it is absolutely beautiful.  the navy/royal blue color is exactly as shown in the photo.  it is 70% rayon/30% silk.  i don\\'t read chinese, but the percentages are on the tag.  the fit is perfect.  i ordered a medium because they didn\\'t have a small, and i\\'m glad i did.  i wear a dress size 8 and their medium fits me perfectly: arm length, shoulder width, pants length -- all as though custom made for me. i washed it in cool water, delicate cycle, and put it in the dryer for 10 minutes on delicate.  it came out without any shrinkage and without any wrinkles. i couldn\\'t be happier. i know the shipping is terribly expensive, but in this case it was worth it.<br />update: the body of the jacket and pants, i believe, are 100% rayon or polyester.  the only silk in the garment seems to be the inner white cuffs on the jacket which fold back and out.  i don\\'t mind, really, since it keeps the outfit from shrinking, but if you are looking for silk, you may want to rethink your purchase. also, where the seams in the legs meet is a bit rough. otherwise the outfit is very comfortable.  one more thing...don\\'t try to sleep in this outfit.  because it\\'s not real silk, it is overly warm.  i am still happy that i purchased it, but i wish it were real silk. man, was i ever surprised at the quality and fit of these pants! i have no issue wearing these for activities such as ballet class, hiking, or yoga, the length is perfect for me, hitting the bottom of my feet when barefoot. a very thinning, attractive silhouette. i bought large, and i am 5\\'7, average weight. bought a second pair later, since i was so pleased! i have no issue with see-through fabric, but if you are worried, order a size up. good purchase these are great basic pants. cotton and easy to pull on and off. great for toddlers learning independence and for toilet training. they aren\\'t fancy, but life\\'s not a baby fashion show. super comfy.still fits well even after washing & drying.has the look of jeans but not jean material..has a lot of stretch & softness.  glad i purchased these. kept me nice and warm.  it\\'s been pretty cold here in nyc.  loveeeeeee them so cute! i will definitely order another pair! i love it my babies don\\'t wear any other brand. so soft and comfy! wow! is all i can say these jeans arrived fast and the fit is perfect. i ordered 3 pair and i will be ordering more. in my opinion these jeans are perfect for anyone. i love them!!! was surprise it fits well.e cute design, very comfortable, good material, good for exercise and dress up<br />i will recommend this product to my students and friends being a bbw means having trouble finding the perfect fit in clothes at times, but these pants always fit well and look good and are very comfortable.  i\\'ve bought as many pairs as i can in case they stop selling them.  i wear them to work mostly.  i have all colors.  the length is just right and the fit is just right.  thank you, alfred dunner, for making a pair of pants that a bbw can wear and look good in. i want roomy and it is but not too large. great for work awesome pajama pants fantastic for the price, but it does wear out fast. these pants ended up being pretty nice.  some people complained about them being see through-yes if they are tight on you and you bend all the way over, you can kinda see through them-that is most yoga pants though.  i thought the length was good. i\\'m 5\\'7&#34; and 145lbs and ordered a medium-they fit really nice.  overall i would buy again (if they would get my size in some more colors!) i am 5\\'10&#34; and 156lbs, they fit right in some places but the front and back seams started ripping out after one wear. i get if i was a bigger person but i am actually not that big.  besides the seams i absolutely love my leggings. very comfy, and fits perfectly, i might actually buy more this is my first order of this brand and i have mixed feelings. the fabric is very light weight which is nice in hot weather. they seem to run large. i will wear them around the house for comfort. exchanged for the medium and fit great! he loves them! good our active little 11 month old basically crawls out of these pants, but they are perfect for night time when we don\\'t want to put him in socks that he will kick off. good elastic at waist. excelente. the picture says it all. great comfy pants, soft material. i always loved this style and this is one good buy for me. ill definitely be wearing that a lot ! and the amazing part about it is that it is not as shiny as in the picture .. fast shipping and the perfect size great looking, feels great, get one size down the navy blue was a little darker in color than i\\'d expected.  it didn\\'t bleed dye when i washed it as much as other people had said it would, but it did bleed a little.  i got a long, like other reviewers suggested, and i love it!  it\\'s very comfortable. just got back from a trip to europe.  you\\'ll be wearing these soon!  hammer time grows up.... they are really comfty but for those who have a bigger butt than what is &#34;proportional&#34; to their waist, the size runs a bit small. i have a thin waist but a larger butt so i would reccomend those like me to go a size up anyway cause they\\'re meant to be baggy, not tight anyway. great product! oh my goodness, these pants are heavenly! i couldn\\'t wait to put them on, and i hate taking them off!!! actually have had these pj\\'s for a while, just wore them recently and they were very comfortable and just awersome. i just got this pair of pants today along with a few others and i must say these are just amazing, love the pattern and style, but the picture is misleading because it shows the stiching as teal when the stiching is really radioactive green. great product for the price pants fit great. defiantly research on line and make sure you get your size right. need to know waist and inseam. most web sits will tell you how to measure yourself and to compare to the sizing chart. take the 10 min and figure it out so they fit right. no one will take a free return because you didn\\'t order the right size. you have been informed. these have the pocket for the knee protector pads to go into. my daughter loved them! they fit perfectly and have been washed 2-3 times with no fading. i like the way this item makes  me sweat and it\\'s a  little big but i can make it work. i really, really like these pants.  the material is nice, they fit to size, and the length is perfect for wearing with sandals, ballet slippers, or any other flat shoe.  one additional comment:  i ordered the pants to wear to lunch with a group of 14 cousins.  the seller promised and met my desire to receive them in plenty of time to wear to the luncheon.  so kudos to the seller! i love these pants they are very comfortable and soft they are a tad bit long but i\\'m a short person so that\\'s probably why bought these for the wife and she looks amazing in them!  the pic is not completely accurate though.  the lace runs and connects up in the front so it\\'s see through.  you can only wear these with a really long shirt (dress type shirt)) or under a dress.  other than that, i will definitely be buying a few more for her.  she stands at 5\\'3 and 100lbs and they fit as expected.  nice fabric and looks pretty durable. ive bought this pants before for my girl and oh lord jesus..there was a boner inside my jeans...it made my girls ass looks so good...i recommend.. i really like how long this pant is. i am 5\\'10&#34; and long pants are hard to find. this is the perfect length, it goes all the way to my heal. i did expect the pant to be thicker - it is definitely not something to wear when it is cold outside. it isn\\'t see-through, though! i had yoga pants from wal-mart that fit really well, size large. i bought these in a large as well and they are tighter than the wal-mart ones. i did find they were a bit sheer when stretched around \\\\\\\\\"thunder thighs\\\\\\\\\". i am 5\\'6\\'\\' and about 150lbs. great length and i am sure a better fit when i lose a few pounds :) military grade bdu as expected. i only ordered one pair, i wasn\\'t sure about the quality for such a low price, but they are really nice quality and fit perfectly.  i am going to order several more pairs! a little more snug than i expected it... but i plan on working out in these pants, so hopefully they will feel a little looser as i get a little thinner. they are truly super soft and silky feeling. the fold over waist is so much more comfortable than a regular elastic waistband, plus it covers a lot more securely when bending over or doing yoga poses. i would have given it five star if it fit me better. yes this fits as expected. i am 5\\'9 and the length of the jumper is not short it fits really well my granddaughter loves it!! loved them it is really comfortable while i am going to sleep i like it but the quality is okay not that but the price is accceptable these just arrived today and after trying them on i have decided to stay in them to complete my homework! i ordered a large and i am 5\\'7 around 163lbs and they fit decent. they could possibly be a tad tighter but i\\'d be afraid that they would be too snug if i got a medium. from a few other reviews i was afraid they might be too short but they are not at all! i have yet to try them with sneakers but i think they will be just fine. the fabric feels nice and sturdy too. the fol over part is rather flattering and cute too. thinking that i will order some in other colors too. these *rule*. they say \\'hercules\\' on them and they mean it.  i worked construction in seattle for several years with the same pair of these. other bibs lasted anywhere from 1 day to 5 weeks. these stand up to rebar; concrete pours and all kinds of other abuse. i still have the same pair, and they are  in great shape. i was excited to get my daughters swim diaper and wasn\\'t at all disappointed when i received it in the mail. it\\'s cute and works well for my 6 month old daughter. i\\'m very tiny and have to admit to being a bit leery about buying any clothing online.  i am very hard to fit.  so imagine my surprise when i tried them on and they actually fit!  just a bit too long, but i can work with that.  i absolutely love these pants and can\\'t wait to wear them to practice.  i even love the scarf on the side. must have item regardless if you do yoga or not. perfect for the gym or every day. great fabric. looks and feels good. you can\\'t go wrong...the good old fold over pants. love them love these pants.. they are soft and really help i have wide hips and they make them look smaller and really did lift my butt.. i\\'ll be buying more pairs these are great and comfortable. i went back and purchased another one. the fit is more relaxed than a traditional yoga pant, but imok with that! i was very happy with my purchase - these cargo pants don\\'t stand out like a sore thumb style-wise and they fit perfectly. i was looking for girls clothing that are warm for the cold winter months.  this was it. the material isn\\'t typical yoga pants material, and the seam can get annoying. but they\\'re comfortable. the material is more along the lines of leggings. these pants are so comfortable! i got a medium, i\\'m typically a size 8 and 5\\'5&#34;. the pants are a tiny bit loose, but not to the point i can\\'t wear them. they\\'re also too long to wear with flats/flip flops, but look great with a wedge its very nice and sexy and looks good and i like it alot so thanks for the good deal and will not be the last i love the way these fit they are perfect for my shape. cute but super thin and long- only for a really low bmi baby i love thermals and these are a nice addition to my \\\\\\\\\"cold weather\\\\\\\\\" collection. they are thin so fit nicely under jeans, but they are still nice and warm. they are ribbed so don\\'t bind or constrict (which is really important to me). the only thing i don\\'t care for are the cuffs. i usually wear a pair for sleeping in and the cuffs stretch out a little too easy after 2 nights of wearing. this makes the pants ride-up and my legs get cold. if you wear them tucked into socks they\\'re fine. my great grandson loved them the spouse lloved it..  caused great joy and laughter..  woman uses the large tshirt to sleep in now..  two more words.. good product love these jeans although they become shorter with washings so instead of ordering petite or short, i order average and after a few washings they are fine. i have ordered from baby phat in the past and never had a problem with it fitting wrong.  for some reason this item was extremely too small i couldn\\'t even get it up over my knees. these pants are great!  i\\'m still early but i\\'m to the point where my regular clothes are too tight and maternity are too big - these fill the gap.  they\\'re comfortable and look great. so comfy i love them im a big yoga pants fan lol i have so many of them the price was just right. i wore these pants after having them altered and hemmed, dry cleaned and pressed.  and i must say they are comfortable, light weight, great for summer casual and formal dress.  when i first got them, i thought, oh no, these feel too light, they must be made of some very cheap material.  but they do feel very comfortable and well made.  i must say though on the negative side, they do wrinkle easily and are very difficult to press. usually the length of sweats are not long enough for my hubs. this seems like it will be, as it\\'s a gift and he has not yet opened it. it is thick and seems of good quality. love!! :) these are absolutely cute on my sister in law, she is a petite 17 year old and this fit great.  in the past when i order size 1 they are too big, this time they were perfect. love this style - wallflower! after the 3rd wash the elastic broke :\\'( ...other than that it fit perfectly as a tall person (5 foot 10) i have a lot of trouble finding regular pants and an even harder time finding yoga pants. these are fantastic and definitely long enough! i bought two pairs! love crazee wear.  i first bought them in hawaii and am glad they are on amazon.  i plan to go back often. fits really well i was hoping that these would have the thickness like a favorite pair of yoga pants i own but they were thinner. the cotton/spandex ratio is not a tell tale of the thickness. i think a thread count of yoga pants should be put in the description, or something like that idea. bought two more~!!!!! i love this pants! it is of very good quality and the size fits perfect! the cost is affordable and the delivery was on time. its everything i expected, in this stylish and comfortable pants. these fit great not to long as some have stated very comfortable. love them love them and now have 5 pairs. i wore them on a trip abroad and they were comfortable on the plane. after being in them for 22 hours, i still looked crisp and pulled together. i also use them for my workouts and the legs aren\\'t too big to get in the way. i find them very flattering. i am 5\\' tall and after i washed and dried them they were the perfect length. they shrunk up about a half inch. wow - these are cool.... i was very skeptical about the quality and type of fabric not sure yet how they\\'ll wash... but out of the box so comfortable and it\\'s hard to tell they\\'re not jeans by just looking at them - in them though - wow.... lovely stretchy pant comfort, thick material, nice stitching details - i hope they hold up after washing a few times - but i\\'m delighted! they fit very nice but they are very very long.  if you have long legs you will love these!  i\\'m very average and had to wear a 2 inch heel in order to not hem them. have both the black and brown. very flattering, without being constricting. very comfortable. great for yoga. not slippery at all. tree pose (for example) is not a problem in these. they fit great i love it. it fits well. real cozy tight but comfortable i\\'d buy it again fit as expected, not heavy at all. feels so comfortable most versatile pair of pants ever. first time i wore them, wasn\\'t sure they\\'d fit but they expanded over me perfectly. would love more of them in different colors. they fit just right and not too thin either, good purchase. love these pants. they are sturdy, comfy, warm and super cool!! my new favorite article of clothing. go buy these i love these pants! i am at 12.5 weeks and none of my other pants fit anymore. these fit great early on and i anticipate them to fit well all through pregnancy. they look very professional and have a great fit in the legs, yet they are beyond comfortable. i will probably wear these every day and need to order an additional pair! i bought this suit and was a bit scared due to previous reviews concerning the size on other kushies items. nevertheless i bought a 6 month as well as 9 month and the sizes are perfectly fine. my little one is 3 month old and the 6 month suit is still very big. sizing is comparable to carters!  i love the fact they used organic cotton and the design (bought the pink) is very cute!   the prize is unbeatable especially due to the organic cotton...  thank you! i got short legs so the pants are a little long. fast delivery, perfect fit and perfect quality...... i love this jumpsuit! its comfy and cute! i plan to purchase more jumpsuits for this summer! i hope to buy a multi colored jumper. excellent very soft i was nervous that this tracksuit would not fit given some of the reviews, however, i thought they stayed true to size.  i ordered a large, as i usually wear size 8/10 pants with a very athletic build in the butt and thigh area and a smaller waist.  the large fit me perfectly.  i am 5\\'7 and also found the length of the pants to be perfect.  the material is a little cheap, but that\\'s to be expected with the low price, so i do not plan on drying them. very happy with these. you can always count on a good product with alfred dunner.  they always run just a little large.  great buy and good quality. these leggings were a great purchase for $10! much better quality than you see in deb shops or other comparable cheap clothing stores. material really clings to every inch of your body, and the high waist isn\\'t too tight - adds just the right amount of extra hold and cling to avoid muffin top. plus if you have a long torso like me, you don\\'t have to worry about shirt length.<br /><br />the &#34;wet&#34; look is great the first few times you wear it, but will show some wear from sitting after a few wears (less shiny on the butt area).<br /><br />sizing note: like other reviewers have said, these leggings run small. the pair i got had some korean on the label and was size &#34;l&#34;, which would fit most us small/medium sizes. i am 5\\' 7&#34;, wear a size 8 and these in a large fit perfectly. they stretch, but not a ton due to the material, so go up a size if you are in doubt. i ordered petite size but the length was still too long for me.  oh to be short :(  but other than that these pants are very comfortable, i love them. i buy a lot of stuff from amazon and seldom leave a review even if i really like a product. but i liked these pants sooooo much and noticed they didn\\'t have any reviews so i thought i would leave one. these pants are so comfortable. they fit me perfectly and made my 43 year old bum look pretty darn good :)  the fabric is stretchy and comfortable. they are form fitting but not tight! they are of great quality and have some really cute details. and they are a great price! i paid $12.99 --- whaaaaat!?  i bought the navy ones and i\\'m going to buy the gray ones right now. i am a size 11 and ordered a size 13 based on the reviews. they fit perfectly! they are extremely comfortable as well. i will be ordering more for work! i bought two pair and am very pleased with them.  they are comfortable and wash very well with no ironing which is exactly what i wanted.  they arrived on time which pleased me. bought these for my dance performance! the crowd adored it!!!!! and it\\'s sooo comfortable!!!! i use it 24/7 in the house, and i can put my ipod, my phone and my camera in one pocket!!!! i just love the pants! the only thing is that it keeps me a little too warm, considering we\\'re in summer, that\\'s a bit annoying! but otherwise, it\\'s perfect for everything! arrived on time, product was as defined, no issues. love these pants! i always get compliments and they are so comfy! i replaced the elastic on the waistband because i prefer to wear my pants a little lower on my hips, but it\\'s an easy adjustment. if you want to wear normal men\\'s pant that sit at the waist, these well worth the price. his product is very good. the fabric stretched. the seam in the crotch is very long but it looks very nice pants . i am very satisfied. i totally recommend these pants are excellent. very soft and warm. for the money, just awesome! the material is light and silky! perfect for summer! makes my butt look fantastic :) i will be ordering these again!!!! this product was exactly what i needed and at a good price. nice fit, great to lounge around the house or run errands in. size large fits nice on my body type of larger hips and thighs. they\\'re pretty nice! if you\\'re worried about the size, especially in the hips, i would maybe order a size up or i would line-dry them after washing instead of in the dryer (which i\\'ve done a couple of times at this point and they seem to hold up well so far). the fold over waist band is nice. you can wear it high waisted like a control top or very low on the hips or somewhere in between. nice silky fabric and pretty lace. perfect fit. love the feel. now that i have some my wife wants me to buy her some. can\\'t wait to buy other products we are happy with the purchase of long underwear. could not find any locally in the summer. as a previous reviewer said, these are women\\'s pj bottoms. i suppose a slim guy could wear them, but he\\'d have to order an x or xx large. the fabric is soft and the length is good (i\\'m 5\\'7\\\\\\\\\" and they more than cover my ankles & the backs of my heels.)    what i don\\'t like is the \\\\\\\\\"boxer\\\\\\\\\" elastic waistband. there\\'s a tie cord, which is almost redundant with the big elastic. (the elastic is about 1\\\\\\\\\" wide.) i don\\'t like anything tight around my waist/stomach (i weigh 120, btw). i ordered the medium size & the fit is good, but i think i\\'ll remove the elastic. it\\'s sewn in, so it will be a bit of work, but i have a sewing machine. these are super soft and i feel so good about buying an organic cotton product, but i think they have to fit rather snugly.  our son wears 18-24 month sizes and the pee just runs right out instead of getting trapped in the thick, absorbent part of the pants. i wish we could find a smaller size in these! good fit looks good.  giving as a gift so i hope it fits as expected. these would never fit anyone who was pregnant. they were gifted to me by someone who ordered them to wear while she was expecting. they are super tiny and the fabric doesw not stretch at all! there is a very odd little button that can be set at a larger waist size. i like them because i have thin legs. would not fit anybody with big thighs ever...hope this helps love it but it fits a little too tight these look great on everybody. i was expecting something cheap that i could wear a few times and throw away (i\\'m currently pregnant and need to start wearing pants with a little bit more &#34;give&#34;), but i would say the quality is comparable to a pair of lululemons without the $100-$120 pricetag.<br /><br />the one drawback (if you could call it that) is that the branding is totally visibile because of how the pants are designed with a &#34;foldover&#34; at the waste. at a quick glance it looks like the trademark red lululemon horseshoe but when you look closely you can clearly see it\\'s a &#34;t&#34; for the t-party brand. it isn\\'t removable because its glued into the fabric so you have to proudly sport these as wannabe knock-offs. however, since they\\'re easily mistaken as lululemons, you could also think of it as getting thing for a much cheaper price.<br /><br />regardless, i love these and have purchased 4 pairs. highly recommended and not much to lose at this pricetag. came quicker than promised, nice quality. best gym pants i have ever used. they are comfortable and are perfect for working out. i am getting another one for a family member. these are awesome and would highly recommend to anyone. without a doubt the most comfortable pair of maternity pants i\\'ve ever owned.  well constructed and suitable for work or after hours activities.  wish it came in khaki! great price for pants like these !!! so comfortable, and love the color selections.....i have every color!!!! hope they come out with more i bought these for my 83 year old mother and they fit perfectly. everything she wants in a pair of pants. waist sits high where she likes it above stomach, the petites were perfect length for her 5ft 1in frame, the pockets lay nicely. i\\'ll definitely be ordering more from this company. great fit love this! so far. the fabric is thin and breezy, the waist is nice and high, the thighs are thin but not skinny, and the cuff is slim.  it\\'s hard for me to find a size that fits well because i\\'m short and rather round, so when i rate them as &#34;somewhat small&#34; it does reflect my larger thighs. if you\\'re a slimmer person or carry your weight in places other than the thighs then you\\'ll likely have no problems with these.<br /><br />i think the pattern is so cute, and the thin fabric will be great for summer. these pants fit my son perfect. great price, quality and highly recommend.  my son loves these pants and will buy another pair if needed. most epic pair of pants i\\'ve ever bought. just found out i can still get them, i\\'m about to order more before they vanish very nice fit, but super long. i am only 5\\'7, but with very long legs and these were still very long, so have to hem them, but legs and waist fit well in a large and i am usually a medium. bonito the jumpsuit i ordered in a s. it fit perfect and comfy without my butt hanging out! perfect for a clubbing or girls night out :) my mom wanted something like pajama jeans so i bought her this. my mom loves them. it has a maternity looking top portion to the pants. it is cotton rather than nylon or polyester. i guess because i was buying them for her i didn\\'t notice the description. :-) she said they were comfy. these are her second favorite pants. these are now her favorite pants and she wants them in different colors. she wears them every day. poor pants. she loves it. i gave it a 5 star rating because, i was happy with my order.  i received what was expected.  the pants fit. these pajama pants are very cozy, very nice. fits like a glove. i would order more if i need them. thanks i love this set its so soft and it ship really quickly! i love the strawberries on the clothing and i can not wait for my baby girl to wear these clothing items! these are the bomb.  i will getting another pair.  perfect for squats, benches, deads.  and they look good.<br />if cold and windy you can pull some insulated overpants on and you can get to truck and get home. i need to order another pair of these. hands down the comfiest pants for summer. very very comfortable.  only its a bit short but the inseam is roomy enough and it looks good with my sandals.  i bought 3 in diff colors. :) the fabric is very soft and nice! runs a bit small and the back button can be difficult at times. correct size for a woman but just a little big for my 13 yr old but she loves them i can\\'t speak to long term durability/quality as i just put them on first time last night.<br /><br />but, as far as comfort is concerned, these are right on.<br /><br />he things i dislike most about your average $15.00 to $20.00 pair or sweat pants in the thin rubber band waist, drawstring on the inside of the waistline that is connected so its impossible to tie properly, the same rubber band in each leg that causes them to ride up and stay up on your leg, and maybe worst of all, the crotch that hangs down to your knees.<br /><br />these pants are none of the things noted above.  the wide waistband and drawstring on the outside are perfect.  when you put them on, you don\\'t end up with 10 liters of extra space in the crotch, no baggy ass either.  as mentioned in other comments, the leg holes are unusually wide - thing \\'70\\'s bell bottoms.  not sure why they are that wide, but i don\\'t care.  for me these are for lounging around the house, and if i did end up going out into public in them, the bells aren\\'t so big that anyone would likely notice anyway.<br /><br />i will likely buy more of these. very comfortable and cute this was fantastic!!!<br />i\\'m about size 8 in pants, and these fit with room to spare! the material felt amazing! i slept in these and they kept me nice and warm, and not too hot. and the design did not stretch out too large for me actually at all.<br />so i am very happy with this item and definitely say that others should get this. this size really could fit most people.<br />thank you very much you made my christmas. very comfortable not to hot or cold, they can be worned during the summer or winter, light clothing. love them. very comfortable.  i wish i had bought more. great price, quick shipping, and wonderful product. wore these under a short dress in las vegas. i wasn\\'t worried about indecent exposure! awesome! im 5\\'5&#34; about 150 i bought the medium and it fit really nice. the fabric is nice and soft very light weight perfect for my zumba class. i ordered these for a 70\\'s themed college graduation party and they fit the bill!  i ordered a size small (normally wear petite 0) and they fit perfectly--have extra room so they are not too thigh-hugging, so someone who\\'s wears a 2 or 4 would be fine. they are soft and comfortable..also fairly thin so shouldn\\'t be too hot even though party is in early june. i ordered the docker pants for the price and any length you need  ,haven\\'t seen so many sizes on one site. delivery was very fast,same day out the door service .i don\\'t think you can beat this combo <br /> <br />jrickowens what i wanted they are a little sheer so you will want to wear something underneath them, but great for the price. my wife bought these for halloween and they look awesome. i used this to stretch some antique pants. it worked like a champ. it\\'s a bit flimsy, but does the job. satisfied customer absolutely love these denim pants - especially the flat front band with elastic back - just what i was looking for.  they are very comfortable and fit perfectly.  would definitely recommend very highly. nice just very thin. but love them! lettering is on good i was looking for leggings that aren\\'t see through and these are perfect!!! i love them, they fit perfect! t-party has to be one of the best brands for leggings and yoga pants &#60;3333 fit very good and love the quality of the pants i love these pants. they are very comfortable and the elastic waistband isn\\'t as tight as my other tiger claw pants. the waffle fabric is soft and will get softer the more they are washed. the only negative is that there is a tiger claw logo embroidered on the right thigh. i never buy clothes with logos, so if i had the option, i would oder the pants sans logo. perfect love these pants these pants are comfortable and the fabric is soft. i wear them alot. great quality for price.  i hate carters narrow bottomed pants and was looking for straight legged pants at an affordable price.  these are made in india and make great pajamas or play wear.  the 2t waist is a bit large on my 17 month old daughter but the length is ok which leads me to believe she will probably outgrow the length in a few months but it is summer so it will be fine.  i will buy more in a bigger size if available.  i bought zutano pants too but will return bc the cotton is rough.  this is a soft cotton.  very comfy. they fit great & are lightweight - perfect for sun protection in the heat! i started putting our 2 year 4 month old son in these 5 days ago to start the potty training process.  our son is about 36\\\\\\\\\" tall and 26 pounds--i bought the 2t and they were a wee bit big on him, but they shrank to fit after washing.  there is just enough extra padding in the crotch that if he starts to go and then stops to get to the potty his pants aren\\'t wet.<br /><br />i highly recommend these over pullups--you might be doing a few more loads of laundry, but i find the potty training results far quicker and consistent in the \\\\\\\\\"big boy\\\\\\\\\" undies.<br /><br />my only complaint is these are $5 overpriced here--i got them for $7.99 at the bullseye store after i had already ordered here. excellent quality and i found the style and color on amazon that i couldn\\'t find in the stores. glad i went that route. wore to a renaissance festival wedding i love the material, and these pants are good quality.  i am going to order large and give the mediums to my daughter to wear, she loves them. great they were long enough but just a bit too small .i returned them for a larger size. quality is good but they run a bit small. these pants are beautiful, however, will only fit if you\\'re about 6 feet tall. i waited too long to request a return, so if anyone is very tall and would like these, let me know. these leggings look great and are very comfortable. the material is soft and the quality seems pretty good. i\\'ve worn them out to the club and they look pretty hot! they can also be worn casually, with a tee shirt. i recommend them to others. its good enough. ordering 2 more after wearing the first two pair every day for 3 months ‚Äî and yes, i have washed them several times. :)<br /><br />great product and fit. i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; and 125 lbs. the medium is just the right length for me, so might be too short on tall ladies. i like these shorts, i bought them because my school colors at my college are green & gold & i wanted gold color short to wear to a game. this was the perfect shade! the color is exactly how it looks online.the shorts are slightly higher then i thought they would be they\\'re fitted kind of like volley ball shorts. they are also extremely thin so i would wear black underwear or else the color/ prints on your underwear will show. the last issue i had with these shorts is that it gave me a camel toe, so i couldn\\'t wear thin underwear with them, i had to use a thicker pair of cotton panties. with all the issues i had i still would give these shorts four stars because at this low price you get what you pay for and i wasn\\'t expecting much out of them. i wouldn\\'t wear these shorts out on a regular day, as everyday shorts. i would only use these shorts for under a really short dress (if i got them in black) , a sporting games, or pjs. nice i just thought they were a little to small, even though they stretch. service and quality of product were great. pants are too small (short and tight) for someone 6\\' 3&#34;, 200 lbs. i work out every day and i have lost 31 lbs in the last few months. suddenly, i hit a plateau, which is very annoying. my stomach and hips could use that last ten pound weight loss (which can be difficult). i bought these pants and put them on immediately. i measured my waist and it was 30\\\\\\\\\", so i ordered a size 5...perfect fit! i wore them around the house and for a short jog; the next day i weighed, as i do every morning. a 2 lb weight loss! i know that they will help you shed water weight, but since they made me sweat so much, i made sure i kept myself hydrated. i did research on these pants and found that they also help with thermogenics (raising your body temperature, which they are obviously good at) which can also help you melt body fat, *if* you work out. so far, i love these pants and wear them for every workout! money well spent, which is a lot more than i can say for some so-called \\\\\\\\\"weight loss\\\\\\\\\" products. i know there is no magic cure, unless you work out -- but these pants are a great helping hand. super flexible, comfortable , and are high waisted so they stay on you when you are up to your typical shenanigans. i am 5\\'5, 150 lbs and i ordered a large, they got so well and look really hot, shipping was great too. only thing is the material can get slight wrinkles around your curves, but real leather pants would have that too. and i noticed after i few days of use when i sit down there are tiny abrasions appearing on the shiny black material on top of the tights, but it\\'s hardly noticeable. as i joke, buy things with a good price to sexy appeal ratio, and these pants do just that, for just $15 ish bucks. super comfy and perfect length!! amazing but for the cheap price. highly recommend !! love love love them ...fit great...price is right! i\\'ll be back! love these pants but i have to wear heels since they\\'re so long. i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; average height but yeah, a bit too long. i am very satisfied with the belly dance costume. i love the way it looks along with all of the other things that i have ordered these leggings fit nicely and i\\'m a juicy person. they stretch and you can fit stockings on underneath. i wear a large and bought a large they fit wonderfully. very soft and thicker than most footed pants i have purchased from other companies. the pants do run small. i have a 6.5 month old, and bought the 6-12month pair. no way will he be able to wear them past 8 months, if that long. he isn\\'t a big baby either. cute leggings. fabulous basic black pants to dress up or down....love the fit. i love them! very good quality and only $5!! the run super tiny so i suggest buying one or two sizes bigger but they are perfect! this was a gift<br />fit was good and just like she wants it very soft but run a little big they have a good quality and look awesome. i totally recommend this product feet are a little small but fit! fits as i hoped, very cute and soft i would buy another pair. haven\\'t washed yet so not sure if it shrinks or not. most comfy pants of all time. i\\'m 38 weeks pregnant and want to live in these. shipping is terrible though. especially when you\\'re a prime member. i ordered these on the 15th and just got them today, the 27th. but whatever...worth it. i\\'ll be buying more. excellent product these training pants are soft and wear well in the wash. you should buy these oversized so that your child will have an easier time learning to pull them up and down - these allow for quick removal, which is key when training. my daughter is 3 and wears 4t underpants, but i bought these in 5t and they worked out great.<br /><br />they are soft and more absorbant than regular underpants, so they are likely to make a little bit less of a mess when the inevitable accident occurs.<br /><br />highly recommended - just buy a bunch...you\\'ll need them! so stoked to find these.  they are awesome and fit perfect. great pair of workout pants. just right. they are very comfortable and fit very well. i am very happy with the product. i don\\'t know if this is the norm but although i ordered my normal size for this sort of item, what i receive was a tad smaller than expected making for a slightly snug fit. other than that one minor quibble, it\\'s fine. love them i love love love these jammie pants... they fit perfect and are so soft and comfortable..  i have them on right now i bought these pants for lounging around and teaching yoga...although i could have probably fit into the s/m, for the purposes of stretching, i went with the m/l. it fits loose, but is comfortable and has come in handy for moving around. the front flap is a bit intrusive but i simply tuck it back and it\\'s fine. super cute, can\\'t wait to rock these nonstop in the summer my son just loves these pants and they fit well and happily are long enough despite having a small waist. very well made, too i originally bought these from hottopic.com and i tell you, these are my favorite pants i have! fit perfect, looks awesome, and are really comfortable. i wish i bought more, but now on ht.com and here, they are out of stock. bring them back! after almost a year of wear through school and winter, the only worn part is the rip in the back, but i patched it so they still live on! love these yoga pants.  i was a bit worried they\\'d be too small, as i\\'m 7 months pregnant and definitely not a &#34;junior&#34; but the large fits great, and the extra fold over band works as a belly band for the moment.  comfortable, color exactly as pictured (i got lavender), and great price. this product was delivered quickly to me and in perfect condition. if i hadn\\'t chosed the incorrect size i would have been completely satisfied. andrew christian was very understanding in refunds and shipping costs. a little big. got a large cuz i\\'m bigger, but they were a bit big. great i like them a lot i love these pants. i actually have 2 pairs now. they are super comfy. the only negative is that the words can rub off easily but it can be avoided if you are careful when washing them. i turn them inside out and wash it on delicate. and then dry on low. love these !! my son looooovvvee them!!!! he sleeps n play in these pants!!!<br /><br />good quality!!! at such a reasonable price!!!<br /><br />i would recommend clothing line of babyvision to everyone!!! must buy!! saves lot of money!! beautiful i like the style and the pattern...the fabric is very light...almost too light...not sure how long this garment will last. if the quality was better i\\'d say this is an awesome garment.<br />i think the sizing is accurate. these are the most comfortable pants i own!! i wear them once a week and with all different kinds of tops!! love it the set worked perfectly for what i wanted, something to lounge around the house.  however, i wouldn\\'t wear these to yoga and questionable for general out and about wear. these panties are comfortable, cool, easy to look at, and launder, fun to wear, and makes<br />you feel sexy wearing them  it worked for me! i ordered this item just a few days ago, and i got it in the mail today. i\\'m very happy with the fit and they are super comfy! i will be using them for a beetlejuice outfit for halloween this year and also with future outfits. great product and fast shipping. i couldn\\'t ask for better service! thank you! these definitely shrink if you use a dryer, which i do.  they are perfect now (i\\'m 5\\'6), at first they were long.  the colors seem to wash well, and they are so cute you can\\'t help but smile when you put them on. love only yoga pants i wear now. i absolutely love these pants ! at first i was a little iffy about the sizing because straight out the package they looked like kids pants but when i finally tired them in i loved them ! the seller even gave me a 10% off coupon for my next purchase ! set is a little bigger than it seems. but it is ok, my friend\\'s girl will love it!! thanks  you great material. and very comfortable i was looking for zumba pants ,and i saw these,<br />and i was like hum they look like zumba pants,<br />but there not the \\\\\\\\\" zumba pants\\\\\\\\\" so i ordered the real \\\\\\\\\" zumba pants \\\\\\\\\"and these i got both of them the same day ,tried both of them on ,<br />quite honestly i like these pants better! they are soooo cute, and comfortable ,and it just fit me better around the waist than the \\\\\\\\\" zumba pants\\\\\\\\\"<br />and did i mention there considerably cheaper than \\\\\\\\\" zumba pants\\\\\\\\\" , also there are adjustable around the ankles and knees just in case you want them like long shorts! i give these pants two thumbs up lol! i have these pants on right now.  they are very comfy.  better looking on than in the picture. i got these as a christmas gift for my husband a few years ago and he\\'s wearing them as i type this review. so you know they are sturdy, cozy and make a statement about being a fan. what statement that is at home around the house i\\'m not sure of, but they are great pajama pants! i love love love these pants.  got them exactly on the date i as told, the material is super comfy ,they are just right. i am so ready to order a couple more from ella i guess i have to wait until christmas to see if my son likes them, these are my new favorites pants.  i have them in navy and white now.  they are long enough for my 35&#34; inseam legs, long waisted, soft and comfortable.  i will likely end up getting them in every color they offer. they fit just as expected. i will be purchasing more products from this brand. nice little pants, i actually bought them to use under outfits instead of wearing socks because the baby pushes her socks off so quickly.pulling these pants off and on is quicker to do then wearing tights. waooo i love it .. love it love it .. i received super on time i recommend this pant . 200% ... thanks having gained some weight lately, i bought these pants in order to retire my \\\\\\\\\"skinny jeans\\\\\\\\\" based on the review above.  success!  not only do they achieve a forgiving but clean line, but the stretch factor is comparable to gym clothes and it makes them super-comfortable.  i was able to do deep knee bends in them (don\\'t ask).  this is stealthy, though, because they definitely look like dress slacks.  i would have given them 5 stars but i think the price, once you add the shipping, is rather steep.  that said, i am extremely happy to own the pants and will wear them a lot this winter (the material is the right weight for southern climates - you northern gals will have to save them for spring). love them and very comfortable! i am tall so the length was perfect as well. i look forward to the next time i wear them. i was looking for a way to get my daughter use to underware without the mess and these work very well as long as you have a plastic cover to go over. she may not be ready to be potty trained, but she will wear these from timt to time and they give me the piece of mind i do not have to have a huge puddle to pick up when there is an accident. as my daughter learned to crawl, these pants were the best!  they stayed down at her ankles instead of riding up.  cute and comfortable! they are exactly like the picture. at first i wasn\\'t sure i liked them, but after wearing them, seriously comfy!! i decided they were a keeper. i love these. the other reviews were accurate. fit really good and nice. love these pants! they are junior size, so as a woman who wears a comfortable 8, i was a bit surprised the 9\\'s i received were snug, regardless, they are well made and super cute! in love with these leggings exactly as described i put these on the minute i opened the package!  love them! fits perfect! these pants wash and dry great. the fit is wonderful and the elastic waist allows for great freedom of movement. wearto work all the time. sizing is correct. fits great! love love fits to the size, im 5\\'4 height and bought the xl size, length good, elastic waist with tie, soft warm for cold weather. i wear these for working out, running to the store and just around the house when i want to be comfortable but not ready to put on my pajamas. i love how you can pull the waist all the way up and get that extra feeling of support or fold the band down for that more sporty look. i first started buying these when i found out i was expecting our son and was hooked! i have also tucked them into a pair of riding boots and with a long fitted sweater and they look like leggings. they last a long time and you can\\'t beat the price!!! these integrated pants fit my son perfectly he\\'s 6 and is playing full contact football for the first time. i will monitor the durability and fit after the pants are washed for the first time. very nice! these palazzo pants are awesome!  they are soft, comfortable and the legs are not too wide! they are perfect! there is a reason why these have so many great reviews! also i like that you can choose how you want to wear them, either highwaisted or have them on the hips by just simply folding the fabric. i got the black and even though the fabric is thin it is not see-through. as for sizing i got the small, and it fits perfect and looks flattering (my measurements are: 125lbs, 27&#34;waist and 35&#34; hips) ! the length is suprisingly good as well. i am 5\\'3&#34; and they are not too long or short. these look so glam compared to sweatpants, yet they are just as comfortable! really happy with these. i would recommend them! love em look great and feel awesoe i\\'m so happy with these pants! so comfortable and not see through when you bend over. i\\'m 5\\'11&#34; with very long legs and usually the &#34;long&#34; pants never go past my ankle - but i walk on the hem of these! (an amazing thing in my book) i\\'ll be buying many more of these! when i met my husband he was wearing these pants with his wolf moon t-shirt also from amazon [...]. it was love at first sight. i was at walmart strolling down the clearance aisle when a flash of blue caught my eye. then i saw him heading for the gaming department. he asked if they had dungeons and dragons and when the walmart employee said no, he looked so dejected i offered him my extra set of cards. now we are happily married. i can wear these gauchos to church to the park to work! i love how they fit my wardrobe.  the material is thin so in the winter i put leggings under them and keep it moving! these are great pants.  as other reviewers have noted, they run a little big long but i\\'d prefer that so if they shrink a little in the wash, they won\\'t become unwearable.  the material is soft and the fit is excellent.  i will be ordering more! i just bought these and were delivered in less tan a week, so that was a plus. they fit awesome, i often have to wear juniors cloths because they just have the cool stuff even though im almost 21 now, but you take a look at the chart its right on. however be prepared the lighter color in these pants is much dark than it seems in the picture, this was no prob for me tho, its was exactly what i wanted. i bought this for my 3 year old in pink. i absolutely love it! the material is super soft, and the dress has a wonderful flow from the way it hangs. i wish they made this dress in my size. love it wear it all the time this item when first arrived was stiff. beautiful shade of brown. after a wash and damp drying, this corduroy material is soft and supple. will order in other colors to give away. excelente i\\'m in love with these leggings ! they just arrived and they\\'re gorgeous ! they\\'re thick enough so you don\\'t have to wear them with a long shirt and so hip. not overly shiny and in my opinion, they\\'re long enough, though i\\'m quite short myself, 5\\'1. i will definently be buying the lila ones cause these are simply amazing. these pants are top quality.  they fit really well, and are completely wash and wear.  my son has a couple of pairs of these now. i absolutely love these misses annalee & hope ditsy palazzo pants. (apparel)<br />they are very comfortable. they can be worn as a casual comfortable look or a dressy look.  i highly recommend this item if this is your style. the pants were just as they were described.  i am a plus size girl and the pants are roomy and comfortable with a beautiful pattern. look. these pants aren\\'t for everybody. these pants are for true americans.<br /><br />ten seconds after putting on these pants i found myself flying over the alamo on the back of a giant bald eagle like a freaking patriotic hobbit. one time, i put on these pants, rode a harley straight to hell, and punched satan right in the nuts. i wore these pants at the sochi olympics, drank a gallon of bottom-shelf whiskey, and won every gold medal.<br /><br />if you\\'re a true american, these pants will bring you everything our founding fathers wanted for you: cheap booze, stripper parties, and an elastic waistband that respects a full belly\\'s need for freedom.<br /><br />the colors of fire are red, white, and blue, and if they don\\'t burn inside you like dragon fire, then don\\'t buy these pants, because i don\\'t want to share the awesomeness of these sexual leg curtains with some flaccid, phony turd. one of our son\\'s most beloved characters is curious george.  this past halloween, my wife made him the man in the yellow hat costume.  the pants worked great. these will be nice for my aching joints and hips for winter.  thank you! this product fits perfectly and hold up in horrible weather.  very sturdy construction, and in one word, great!!! great my great fabric and very cute they are cut just right. you just have to remember to go a size bigger than you usually wear. i brought these shorts to feel comfortable wearing under skirts. it\\'s actually well fitted and comfortable to wear i tried these on today and i love them. if you want shorts to wear under dresses or skirts theses are the best. these were a gift for my mother who is 5 ft. tall. they\\'re perfect. comfortable and just right for petites. excelente i can\\'t say enough of about the dockers metro line of pants.  i am so happy i found them and hope they never go out of production.  they fit perfect, never wrinkle or fade, and are perfect for casual or business casual situations.  i buy them in bulk because i\\'m afraid some day they\\'ll be gone. these are thick, shiny, tight jazz pants.  i expected all of this except for maybe the shiny aspect, though, i knew from experience that this was a possibility.  if you do not like the shiny spandex looking tight pants, this might be a problem.  we are happy with the purchase, though. beautiful fabric and color! i get so many compliments on these. they are so comfortable and look really cute. i love them! these are the absolute best training pants i\\'ve ever bought, they are super soft - wash after wash.  the size charts are accurate and the quality is superior to the top brands - no stretching and thinness or falling off. they are super thick and fit very nicely.  the price is also the best i\\'ve found.  i cannot say enough good things about this company.  overall - best quality and best price - the best of both worlds.  :)  i will definately be buying more of their products in the future. super sexy! great price too. shows a little skin without showing too much. looks awesome!<br /><br />i\\'m a petite 5\\'3&#34; 100lb woman. it fits and it\\'s stretchy too! these are light weight and allow freedom of movement with out stretching out. like it. i\\'m going to buy another great fit, happy with purchase these fit perfectly, and they seem to be really well made. i\\'m 5\\'9&#34; / 5\\'10&#34; and medium fit me perfectly, they\\'re definitely long enough. great training pants! have extra material on side for pulling up and down, would highly recommend. great pants for my baby for a low price! when i fist took these out of the package, i thought they would never fit me! they look tiny. but i tried them on, and wow, they fit. they stretch, and conform to your body. they are even a little loose in the waist. they are long, i\\'m 5\\'4&#34; and they have a little wrinkling at the ankles. now let me say how comfortable these are. they feel like you favorite yoga pants, super soft and stretchy. they move with your body. i wouldn\\'t wear them without a long shirt, because i\\'m a little overweight and these show the bumps. but i definately will wear them, with a tunic, or long tee. these look good with heels, or flats.<br />i received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review. opinions are my own material is verygood, heavy and it acquires some wrinkles after being used . however; all in all it is a nice pants to have . the only problems i faced . two have tigfht waist while one is a bit loose. love these! the feet are shaped in a way that reminds me of a little baby elephant. i wish the legs were slightly longer, but they are great little pants! i will be buying the next size up when we need them. these pants do make me sweat just from doing housework in them. i love these pants. i ordered them in a small and they fit, but they are a little loose in the lower tummy area for me which is where i want it to be the tightest. other than that it\\'s perfect. they do have a slight rubber smell to them, but after the first wash it\\'s not too noticeable.  super fast standard shipping. love these running pants! highly recommend them nice comfortable fit these pants are exactly what i had in mind.  they are very soft and comfortable.  they could be  a bit longer, but will work.  the waist string is a bit tight, but with waist band rolled down one, that helps that problem. these are a must for my wardrobe. i can dress them down, dress them up. and talk about comfy!!! they wash up and look great. in a word, perfect!!! fine by me. very cute fashion statement outside and comfy to lounge around in inside.  i adore these. my only problem that ended up being a plus is that in the picture they look brown but they are actually green.  a beautiful mistake! i bought the blue galaxy leggings and they are the leggings are awesome and the colors are very vibrant and they fit great and they arrived much earlier than expected these were a good buy and a really good price. :d i was looking for something nice and warm and that is what i got. i would have liked an inch less on the waist line. i does not slide down my over my hips but rides a little lower then i am normally comfortable with. the leg length is just fine. i am 5, 4 and a size 8. these pants fit perfectly.  they are not too long or short and they are not tight and have a nice stretch. i could see a person 2 to 3 inches taller having no problem wearing them. i wear them during spin and cardio. they wick really well but don\\'t leave me feeling funky or wet. they are not too heavy, wouldn\\'t do for winter but not too heavy and could work for spring and early summer. i will definitely get more. slightly itchy, but very warm! love the color.  so difficult to locate the color so i am very happy. gave to someone whom could not find the color i\\'m a larger size woman and i sometimes have a hard time finding clothes online that fit right. i bought this and was so pleasantly surprised when i tried the set on because not only did they fit, but they were made very well and extremely comfortable. i will be buying more sets from this company when i find ones i like, this was a great find. a while back i ordered a pair and was so comfortable wearing them that i just had to order two more pairs. these pants are super comfy!  i got them to replace the crappy pajama/lounge pants that came with a loki t-shirt i bought on amazon from another seller.  these pants are an even better match for that shirt (black & green), and they\\'re far softer and more durable.<br /><br />i tried them on, then washed and dried them (on low) before wearing and they still fit perfectly, so they did not shrink.  (i wouldn\\'t dry them on a higher setting, though--it would probably damage the printing.)  thry\\'re not *too* heavy and they breathe well, so i bet i\\'ll be able to keep wearing these through fall.  i think i\\'m going to get the captain america version, as well. i\\'m a huge fan of relaxed clothing. i tend to gravitate to over sized clothing for weekend wear and this were perfect. the color, quality and style was what i was looking for. i ordered three pairs of these to wear around the house. they fit great and are very comfortable. i am 5\\' 5&#34; and weigh 128 lbs and the size small fits perfect. they are snug like yoga pants and you can fold down the waistband or leave it up if you want. they are not see through and they flare out just a tad at the bottom of the leg. they are kinda long, but that doesn\\'t matter to me. i love them and wear them every day! i liked these pants, they are not too heavy but just the perfect amount of support.  size was true to what i usually order (didn\\'t have to adjust up or down). the great thing about this is they fit nice; the large top elastic waist can either fit high on your body to help address muffin tops or you can pull it down halfway to put extra support around your lower belly. the material is very thin and soft so it\\'s great if you like to wear yoga pants in hot weather. that being said, the seam on my first pair ripped the first time i wore them. i purchased six pair so we\\'ll see how the others hold up. if i don\\'t experience any ripping on the other pairs then i\\'ll order more. the lightweight material is really comfortable. nice i like em alot. they\\'re soft and flowy and i got several compliments on them. they came quickly and were just as described. i love the pants but they are too small for my long legs. the size fits great but the legnth is to short. im 5\\'9 so i would say tall women look elsewhere. luckily i use them for work so it doesnt matter much. just what i needed and fast shipping! thanks! these remind me of the pants worn when i was younger; and now my daughter will be sporting them...in red...how cool. timely arrival, appears to be good quality material. love it bought for my daughter, she loves how they fit. was happy to receive this.  my friend went as a bunny and me as hugh.  this is comfortable (how many costumes can you say that about?), and everyone immediately knows who you are!    because of the character, it\\'s a great party costume!!!!  it\\'s nice on the outside, would wear a t-shirt or something underneath though.    overall this was a great deal! always love the classic tripps. fits perfect according to the chart and came in perfect condition. i also received it a few days early! when i first got them i thought they looked a little cheap but once i got them on... the material feels well made, love the fact that i don\\'t have to worry them becoming see-through if i bend over. the print is not as clear as in the picture but have yet to have someone point that out to me, all i get is compliments! i\\'m 5\\'8&#34; and have difficulty finding leggings that are long enough but these fit perfectly. i would highly recommend purchasing!! good pants they are roomy and super soft.  i am just sorry that they do have anything after 24 m.  now i need 3t and i feel lost without these ones! i bought these forever ago and my daughter is still wearing them. they are cute, well priced and comfy. definitely worth the price. these are very warm pants. great for winter or chilly night. they are cute and comfortable. i would buy again! these pants are a great value.  for the price, they are good quality- fabric is thick enough and they hold up well. the fit it as expected.  they are not very trendy, but i think the stripes are cheerful. large fit in legs, but comfortable these are my absolute favorite leggings.  elaine accessories has many great items to choose from.<br /><br />these leggings are stylish and a great fit.  i get alot of compliments.  and they fit just right.  i\\'m 5\\'4\\\\\\\\\", 115lbs, 36-28-36.  they make my ass look awesome!<br /><br />i got tired of the boring plain typical leggings sold here in the us. (boring!)  and the ones here sold in the us fit the typical average woman\\'s body.  i have the atypical body, small waist, big butt.  so it\\'s hard to find pants or jeans to fit me right.<br /><br />i bought every design by elaine.<br />thx!!! these combat digital acus are great! heavy duty ripstop material and plenty of storage. you can\\'t beat flame resistant pants for that \\\\\\\\\"secure\\\\\\\\\" feeling when around open flame! these pants fit like they are tailored for me. since things rarely fit me that well i was pleaseed. the knee pad inserts are a plus as are the drawstring waistband & ankles. for those wondering, these are military grade flame resistant army acus. propper is one of the largest military uniform suppliers in the world. you can\\'t beat the price either!! military uniform supply sells these pants for $129.00 ea. on their site. buy these, you\\'ll be glad you did. i purchased these pants for my son as a christmas gift and he\\'s thrilled with them and i\\'m happy his knees will be protected. it\\'s the perfect balance between swift yet relaxing. two thumbs way up! bought l and had to have it altered but a guy in his 70\\'s needed the larger waist; loves the pants.<br />the vendor was helpful and prompt. nice weight, light but not see-through.  drawstring waist lies flat, not bulky.  straight slightly tapered leg.  inseam probably best for those around 5\\'6\\\\\\\\\" to 5\\'7\\\\\\\\\"  i am just under 5\\'4\\\\\\\\\" and cannot wear with flats.  launders well with little to no shrinkage but i do hang to dry. great quality, arrived sooner than expected and they fit great these are adorable lightweight cotton pants!  very cute, but they run tiny.. my little one wears 18mo now and we got the 2t.  they are a little big, but fit her great. was a lil scared this would look cheap..but they don\\'t! i think they r soft and adorable...another gift i bought for my grand babies shower...there worth the money and proud to give them...ty again amazon! i can always depend on alfred dunner to fit as expected. these slacks with the jacket look so nice and are so comfortable on these cold days. these are great, i get a lot of compliments! the length of the pants are really long but work just as well rolled up. they\\'ll last a few years. very stretch, my wife loves it very much. i like the style and all, but i have to return it and get  a smaller size. how do i return it. comfortable and sturdy! cute, and perfect...training has never been easier! thanks! they\\'re beautiful! super shiny, awesome color. they definitely are strechy, but you have to put a little effort into pulling them up if your body type is anything like mine (5\\'8, 140 pounds). they\\'re also a tiny bit see-through. but overall they\\'re great! order two. you will wish you did. these are awesome and loooong for tall girls. my daughter is 33 pounds. so on the size chart they recommend a 4t, they fit her but are really loose. i would say they run a little big. so i ordered more in a 3t. other than that they work great! great product and they are absorbent enough that you don\\'t have huge messes to clean up. i would also recommend buying several of them. i bought 6 and i need more than that. it\\'s our first day of training and we are on pair #5. great price, didn\\'t know what to expect, but was happy. there is a smell to these leggings that take several washes before you don\\'t notice it. smell is similar to a chemical or commercial oil scent. i am thinking of buying the capri\\'s for the warmer weather. great quality, the sizing is right on, very soft and thick fabric, would purchase again, wish there were more colors, i got the grey basic yoga pant and i like them. they fit well. didn\\'t shrink in the wash (big plus) i\\'m off an athletic build with very long legs, and the size large fit well in all the right places. shipping was average time, price was good and they withstood exercise, sleeping and just running around the house. good pick! i had to rate it only 4 stars because i actually had to return it because it is not a true tank top. it is a halter that ties at the neck.  other than that, it is a great costume. the seller was easy to deal with when i had to return it. i would certainly deal with them again if i have an occasion to do so. i\\'m usually a size 1 or 2. 100lbs 5 feet tall and the small fit me. they were long but all pants are too long for me :) this is a nice thick fabric and is very comfy. does not feel like jeans at all. however you can  tell that the seams are not very strong, due to the stretchy fabric. i wash these on delicate cycle and they have been holding up okay. probably won\\'t purchase again but they\\'re  definitely better quality than walmart jeggings. they are the cutest most flattrering pants!!they also have them in pink too(in the store only), but you have to try them on.   they dont look that cute on the hangar.   enjoy! my wife reports these are comfortable, the fleece-lining is great, but they are a little too short (she is 5\\' 8&#34;) the softest material.  i recommend these highly. pants fit true to size.  i washed them, fabric doesn\\'t bleed.  i like the way the pants &#34;lift&#34; your bottom so for those of you out there blessed with a little flat bottom these pants are great! üòÉ i bought this product while looking for golf pants. already used them and i\\'m entirely satisfied. i usually wear a 16 in women so i decided to go for a 20 in these to make sure they would fit since they are juniors sized. they fit me perfectly! my waist is 36&#34; and my hips are 48.5&#34; just for reference. they are a little long, so i need to wear a little wedge or heel, but otherwise they are perfect for work and look so nice! not to mention the price is so affordable! will definitely order more of these, i am loving this brand! i picked these up for myself just because i like spandex and these things for boxers. it\\'s snug, which is what i expected, and they\\'re not too small. works like a underwater swim wear.  good product, tight fit due to material but size is accurate. love these. the print is really nice the material is also nice but i wish it was a little more stretchy but idc about it that much. it looks great on the only problem i had was putting it on over my butt since i have a big butt and it\\'s not flat i had to struggle a little but i succeeded i am def going to wear this for easter.<br /><br />i am 5.6 and 118 pounds with a c cup these are better than underwear! i\\'m a size 12 and these fit very nicely, the are super comfortable and my new favorite pants. perfect for lounging or even kickboxing they are perfectly flexible! :d i\\'m 7 months pregnant got these hoping they\\'d stretch and be comfortable and not cost an arm and a leg.  ok, so not only do they fit comfortably but the waist stretches to fit your belly size. i accidentally bought two pair\\'s and now i\\'m really happy i did !!! can\\'t beat the price either. highly recommend awesome pants, great fit. great training panties! bought this for my husband as a gift. he loves it and it fits well.  so very cozy and comfortable, great to snuggle with.  keep in mind this is 100% cotton, therefore if you\\'re on the verge of needing the next size up, do it. this is the first sadie pants i have purchased and i love them.  very comfortable in the waist and the length for 5\\'6 in average is perfect. love the color. very comfortable waist and nice fit in the legs. would definitely buy more if color options come available. these things are great for a few things...<br />- getting laughs<br />- getting ladies<br />- i guess they\\'re also good for american holidays.<br /><br />i always wear these with random t-shirts from the mountain, what a combo! great loved the pants! they will fade after washing which was expected. i order this in red, and the color holds after each wash. fabric does not leave burn marks when iron. i just order another one in black. these were beyond perfect, for once something fit me to a t.  i am very,very happy and actually ordered two more pair in two different colors.  i am so very satisfied with this product. these look very good on my wife, and though she has shorter legs than the model and does not wear them with high heels, she is still my very sexy wife, causing me to be very appreciative of my situation on this earth. really cute and comfy. they\\'re a little see through depending on the light and the fit, but nothing terrible, they still cover more than leggings! i have two pairs and if i need more i\\'d be tempted to buy more here. i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; and they are way too long, just to give you an idea. it is the most versatile and comfortable pants my daughter has.  at 1 month old, it was still a bit big and long but i just folded the bottom and pulled it higher above her waist.  as she grows, the pants are still one of my most useful and favorite wear-at-home item.  highly recommended. love these jeans !!!! fits great!!! such pretty colors and so soft! cute these are really really baggy. i love them around the house but they would make you look and feel goofy wearing them in public. they are really good quality and super comfy though and i do like them just not in public these are soft, flowing cover-up pants. i ended up buying the next size smaller, a \\\\\\\\\"small\\\\\\\\\". i weigh 129lb and wear cyberswim\\'s sz 12 swimsuits, yet wear the \\\\\\\\\"small\\\\\\\\\" pants and cover-ups. i kept this one just in case my weight goes up, but it is obviously too big for me right now. the smaller pants fit \\\\\\\\\"more slinky looking\\\\\\\\\" than the medium. i would purchase this item again. i love these pants. they are very long but, easy to tailor w/o messing up pattern. made from a material that allow the pants to hug my hips and hide my thighs. the material hangs nicely from the waist down. the fold down waist is a plus. the shirt was very nice but not the size it said it would be. it was about one american size smaller than advertised. im trying to loose a few pounds anyway and will fit but it should have been a perfect fit great value the baseball pants fit my son as he expected.  they are great for practice! my girlfriend bought them and they fit well, especially on her butt :) although made of rather lightweight material,it fits nicely and looks great! thank you i love these pants! i do not understand why i cannot find them anymore in the size and colors i need. please make more and get them out there so people can buy them! i ordered these harem pants in black small and they arrived on time and fit great! they are my go-to pair for whatever weekly clothing emergency comes along, and i couldn\\'t be more pleased! don\\'t be disappointed if you order the pants and they don\\'t seem to fit correctly--- the harem style works well for some body types and not so well for others. i love wearing them with my black dr martens! small in size cause it\\'s junior fit. i got the s, but the are more like and xs, which i like, perfect fit, tight on the butt, flare out on the bottom.<br />totally wear them all the time! i like this pants, they are very comfortable. they are a somewhat ill fitting. the waist is too narrow in comparison with the rest of the pants. if the person is petite they are too long in between legs. look good on very comfortable and fits nicely! form fitting but not so snug that it isn\\'t presentable. i am 5\\'4 and they were just a little long on me, but i make them work because they are so comfortable. if you\\'re taller they would be even better. not see through like some leggings. great deal for the price! these pants are great for newborns because of the small waist.  a basic cotton pant like these are a necessity in any temp/weather.  a great price too! i was really reluctant to purchase from this brand because i was doubtful about the slimming capabilities, but with the return policy i took the risk! i ordered the navy top, brown skirt and black pants so i could mix and match. this really works! it looks like i\\'ve lost a couple of sizes and everything is so smooth. i highly recommend this brand![[asin:b00b73gwss slimming, waist cinching and shaping pants by luxxe¬Æ]] it was worth every penny!!! my daughter started out with okie-dokie training pants.  i was really pleased with the quality, but the stitching in the back appeared a bit uncomfortable.  i looked for another brand, and i ordered gerber cotton training pants (3t).  my daughter loves them (and i fully agree!).  my daughter has been using cotton training pants for almost 2 weeks now, and she only has had one or two accidents. i also love that the package includes a white pair.  now and then she wears white pants/shorts.  i definitely give gerber training pants a 5 stars plus rating.  you can read more about our potty training \\\\\\\\\"adventures\\\\\\\\\" on my blog: [...]%20training love it.!!! great comfortable pants! nice i love these leather leggings! they fit me perfectly, they were comfortable, they covered up all the right places, and i got a lot of compliments when i went out to the club. loved it! however it was slightly big, just wash a couple times in hot water got \\'em right down to size. good fit, not difficult to get on. they are tights style as opposed to legging style, material wise. they are sheer so something must be worn over. very soft material, very well made and a great price. my grandson loves them! love love love them!! i absolutely loved these pants! nothing wrong! warning: the color isn\\'t as bright. only complaint, but the color still is beautiful soft, shipping really fast, comfortable. that\\'s my man opinion i had been looking for pants like this for a while, since i cannot get them in my country.  i am delighted with my purchase! i walk to the lightrail (train system ) when it\\'s cold i put these snow pants on and i am warm all the way.  i also love that the pants have a boot area so no snow gets in my boots. fit perfect, comfortable just amazing!! i recommend this to anyone gym, yoga or just to wear at home or school sure these pants are kind of overpriced for what they\\'re made of (paper thin, really) but i know i will be the happiest pregant woman on earth this summer!  by the time my belly really pops, it will be very hot here in boston so i know i will love them. i tried them on and they are very comfortable.  no regrets. these pants are comfortable, roomy,  and are of extremely durable construction. i love having loads of pockets, which these pants do have, and my favorite feature is the drawstraps on the waist which allows me to get a custom fit. and they didn\\'t cost an arm and a leg either. they\\'re certainly lovely pants, i\\'m usually a size medium and read the comments and bought a large, they fit nicely on the legs but a little tight around the hips. they stretch which is great i can move around and not feel uncomfortable. for the butt lift, it\\'s okay nothing too special, i was concerned it would have  some sort of padding in the back which it doesn\\'t so that\\'s a relief, the material just sort of shapes the butt to make it look a little firmer. and i have an dreadful time trying to find descent pants or jeans so these pants definitely have my tick of approval on comfort and looks. love how warm these are! comforable fit, nice color, i bought them for the brown, long enough, but not as long as they said they were. i cannot express in word how much imabsoloutly love these pants so soft and flowy! super comfy and soft material, not as fancy as it looks in the picture but for the price and how quickly it shipped i like it! fit perfect. i am 5\\'9 150 pounds and the large is just right.<br />the blue and white polka dots are adorable and customer service was impeccable.<br />will be ordering several more pairs for christmas gifts for the ladies in my family. these are my favorite leggings and i plan on buying another pair. they arent really that see through and they arent thick, its perfectly in between. i am 5\\'9 and i wear a size 8 and they come all the way down to my ankles. love it. fits so nice. looks so attractive on quick delivery and good fit. i bought the pants and fell in love with them. i expected the black pair to be the same but was dissapointed with it. it was not as long as my last pair and it is a lint magnet, unlike my blue pair. i will still order another in a different color and hope its like my blue one i\\'m 5\\'7&#34; 155lbs, i\\'m pretty curvy and the large fit me perfectly. i bought the xs for my 20yr old daughter. she\\'s the total opposite, she\\'s stick skinny and she loves the fit as well.  we get so many compliments on them, i even ordered two more pairs for us. the price is very reasonable and the quality is pretty good. wife loves these - very comfy and relaxing to wear around the house! they are well made capri\\'s  they are my favorite for jogging. is a gift so i don\\'t know how is going to fit on the child, but it looked way too cute. true to size and looked good on her.  cancer friend likes them and asked me to order more.  her friends liked the look on her. these are the real deal. large exterior pockets and a comfortable fleece lining that saves wearing an inner layer. they\\'re a little long, but that makes them easy to tuck in boots. a great buy. these fit very well.great stretch.hides the stomach.they are very sexy.i love these pants.i will definitely get these in more colors. soft stretchy material. color is a true black that so far has not washed out. i had to hem them and the legs are wider than i like. i probably should have ordered a size or two smaller. pockets are a bit shallow for my iphone but they work if i really wedge it sideways into the bottom of the pocket. cozy, nice and warm. i wish they made them in at least a couple of sizes. they look good quality. fit well,good materials they are a little long but very comfortable. love this outfit. fits my daughter well. recommend to wash first the material feels a bit rough when u receive it. it\\'s so comfortable and stretchy.i bought in size 20, but i think i could getting a size 18 because the stretch is so wonderful. i want to order another one in another color. very stretchy .. it was very skin tight. order a size bigger very comfy.  sort of see through so wear a long shirt unless you like everyone seeing the print on your undies.  i am short so they went to my ankles.  if you are tall they would be like flood pants.  the material is so nice to sleep or stretch in.  the waist gets loose so go one size smaller. my daughter opened them up for christmas and loved them. she says she wears them every were and glad to have more than one pair.  :) i love these pants.  they are so cute and comfy.  i rec\\'d. lots of compliments. a little larger than expected in comparison to what the sizing chart read. very good quality and comfortable the outfit arrived promptly and i am very happy with it! the fabric is nice and soft and the monkey is just too cute! i really like these and the fit is true to size. it fits perfect and it\\'s comfortable. i\\'m 5\\'5 and 115 lbs. i love the fit of these jeans! almost too loose in the waist. i am 5\\'7\\'\\', 120 pounds and fit.  these look great.  my waist is not tiny about 28&#34;. need to tuck in a thin fitted top or two to keep them from sliding but they stay up okay, and will, if you have a little bit of muscle in the thighs and butt.  i may end up sewing a pinch up, like dart in each side to help keep the waist tighter.  i will definitely wash them by hand in cold water. not sure how long they will last; bought two more pairs at this low price.  they are very fun. but remember, to quote denis leary, &#34;skinny jeans, are made for skinny, ( or at least fit) people.&#34;  these are not made by spanks, or are compression pants which will help you look thin, you need to look pretty decent, not perfect, but good-- to make them look good on you. and they are light weight, yet surprisingly warm and not<br />see- through.  one can see light through the material when they are off the body, but once on, they are sufficiently opaque. i love them, i just hope they last at least a year... the front and back seem to be cut the same therefore the waist is big the back area is small, constantly pulling up, slide downward. runs large my husband loves geeky stuff, and since we work from home, i enjoy being able to find pj\\'s and lounge wear that resonates with our interests.  i was pleased to be able to buy these lounge pants and find a matching shirt to go with them.  they fit very well and unlike other lounge pants with comic themes that we\\'ve bought in the past, these are long enough for him. unique to say the least. my son love them. i bought this for a friend of mine and she was very happy with them. i ordered these and then was a bit dismayed to check tracking and find they were in paris france having been shipped directly from india...however they were shipped fed ex three day air and arrive well before other things i\\'d ordered that were shipped from local vendors. so service was great and i guess we are one world. the pants are 100% rayon and the fabric is thin but the seams appear to be well sewn and the legs end in a sticked three inch wide cuff with two working buttons rather than the cheap elastic found on some costume pants. the waist is also well made. it is about two inches wide and has four strips of elastic sewn in to keep it in place. all said, i am very happy with these pants. the material could have been thicker but it is not the dreaded \\\\\\\\\"see through\\\\\\\\\" as someone esle noted. it looks great! love this pants. so different! fit great! i\\'m a singer so there just my style! these pants are awesome!  received them just in time for the heat in my house to go out, and i had to spend a day w/ no heat, but from the waist down, i never felt cold, with these on!!!  which lets me know they will work just fine outside in the weather... i\\'m in ga, so we get cold, but not freezing... i bought this as part of a birthday present to my besty, but we wear the same size so i tried it on first, and honestly i was in heaven! i really really hope they restock this pair i want one for myself :(<br /><br />+ very good fit and elastic/stretchable<br />+ very comfortable<br />+ lightweight fabric, so good for hot summer days while still keeping the chill away<br /><br />- i\\'ve had many pants of this exact fabric before, and they usually don\\'t last me for long, just a few months or about half a year give or take. but that is fine considering the low pricetag and because i tend to wear them too often for too long as i only have 2 or max 3 pairs to choose from at a time. so i suggest having more options to not wear them out too fast. nice, thin material to keep you from over heating while you work out.  they are form fitting so there is no bunching up no matter what  type of exercise you are trying to do. i love these pants!  i don\\'t love that the crotch ripped when i squatted down to pick something up... luckily, the rip was on the seam, and i was able to sew it with no problem.  also, the elastic waste band folds and flips sideways inside the material... that\\'s super annoying, so i\\'m thinking about sewing it in place.  other than those issues, i love the material, i love the style, and the tiger is really cool! these spandex are not ment to be worn alone, there just for underneath purposes. it does not have extra material on the butt side, and for some, may be a little low. it is not see-thru and i highly recomend them. i will deffs be buying more!! these are very comfortable.  i bought them with the matching top, and both are very comfortable and warm.  good price for what you get.  if the pants came with pockets i would have given them 5 stars. they are amazing pants also what the us marines use in the jungles and woodlands they are dark so you are very camoflauged in heavy wooded areas a bit big but the waist straps will do the trick aswell as the ankle strings i love these pants -- they are very comfortable and different. i like how they are worn in the picture, and i wear it like that when i was to dress up the look. but when casual, some sandals or ballet shoes work well too. the size is one size fits most -- i wouldn\\'t say any larger than 16 since the front panel can hug the stomach and the gap between the legs will create thigh rubbing if you have larger thighs. so any sizes say about 10- 16 should work out fine. they are different and get a lot of looks-  i bought two pairs! do not place in dryer and wash in cold water in order to keep the shape. the sweatpants are soft, ordered an xl as i like mine to fit baggier and they were true to size i expected. i\\'ve washed these numerous times (~10-15) no fading, pilling and logo still in as good a shape as the day i bought them. i\\'d buy these again. i\\'m 5\\'4 and i have a little waist, big butt and thighs, and short legs. i hated shopping for new pants. they were always too small to get past my butt and when i finally went up enough sizes to be able to pull them up, they were way too long and the waist was huge! these fit perfect! right length, can get them all the way up, and no gapping in the back!!! this is my new go-to brand for pants. and i don\\'t have to spend half my paycheck for a pair! we use these daily for our 2 year old to catch little drips. for early potty training they are great for at home but don\\'t catch all of a full \\\\\\\\\"spill.\\\\\\\\\"  love these in place of the thin character underwear you find in stores. they look like little shorts and are great under dresses as bloomers. they do absorb drips very well and my daughter prefers these over any other kind of underwear. love love love them!!! so comfortable!!! i wear them every chance i get!! glad i bought them! :) i was nervous to order these, but they\\'re actually really comfy and a decent material! fits as i would have hoped they would. i love them. living in chicago there\\'s nothing worse than the cold winter wind between december and march.  i work in a hospital, and wear scrubs to work.  anybody that has ever wore scrubs knows how they don\\'t block any wind in the winter.  i bought these pants as a barrier to wear over my scrubs when i am traveling to work.  walking from the parking lot to the hospital shouldn\\'t be a big deal, but you would be surprised when the temperature is in the single digits.  these pants did a great job at blocking the wind.  the only negative thing i have observed is the fleece that is inside stops just above the knee.  i honestly don\\'t know why the company chose to do that, but your legs will be slightly cooler than the rest of your lower half.  they may not be as modern looking with the material like under armour or nike, but those winter workout pants don\\'t block anything when the temperature dips like these do.  i\\'m all about comfort, and these pants give me enough warmth to where i need to go. bought these pants for a belly dancing performance.  love that they have pockets and can be work in many different styles.  these will be great for other costumes as well, not just belly dance. these pants are very comfortable and soft.  i could easily live in them all day long. you won\\'t be sorry you bought these. i love these pajamas. they are not perfect but they are the ones that i grab for first. my little man is so adorable in this super soft onesy and he gets extra snuggly when he wears them. when i pick him up in the night it is like heaven, the softest and sweetest feeling in the world. the material however is a little more fragile than cotton and my husband pulled too hard on one of the snaps and tore the fabric so be gentle when unsnapping. also i feel they run a little small my son is 12 months now and wearing the 18-24 month jammies. i think he will fit into them for a long time as they are really stretchy but they are not hanging past his ankles or wrists. he is a little tall for his age but not extremely so. this material does pill up but it doesn\\'t make it any less soft and cuddly. perfect fit! im 6\\' 3&#34; and 205ibs and the xl was just right. i\\'d say their siing chart is spot on. these fit a bit tighter around the thighs than other capoeira pants i\\'ve bought, but they are great and i am very happy with them. it was a little snug but overall it\\'s a great! i have been wearing harbor bay stretch waist pants for quite some time. <br /> <br />last year i bought some geo foreman stretch pants--which fit fine but the material is not good--it beads up and my wife has a term for that, which i can\\'t remember, and i wear them once and they wrinkle so bad it looks like i slept in them. the store did not carry your harbor bay any more and when i found i could order on line--that was terrific. <br />i love your product-i will order more in another couple weeks --i would like these in brown beside navy and grey. this feels amazing on your skin :) the fabric is stunning and its pure white. i love it! and yes its one size fits all but who cares :) they are still amazing! if you are looking for phat pants or raver pants these are the right ones for you! love the pants very comfy great for a warm up pant fitted pretty well, nice choice for summer, especially blue one i ordered these jogger pants in small and they fit as expected.  i ordered navy blue and black - i like the navy blue better but will keep both pairs.  i like the design with cuffs at the ankles.  i will wear them to my exercise club.  i am very pleased with the pants. great item for mom i got these at a discount to review. my youngest is now potty training. these are hard to find. these are better then plan undies for potty training. they have have a thick pad in them in case of an accident. this is a great deal will be getting more. these are true to size but have a see threw affect if you buy them too small. they are nice and comfortable when working out. i love the way these look, however they run a bit big .. i did keep mine & will either wear them with a belt or have them taken in at the waist. i wouldn\\'t buy them again, need something more durable....with more polyester.  still, these pants are cute and fit me well. wow. these are great pants that have all the extras.  there are wallet slots in both rear pockets. a watch pocket. a change pocket inside the right front pocket, a \\\\\\\\\"d\\\\\\\\\" ring for your keys. and, a secondary button to go along with the snap closure in front.  they are not baggy and fit well.  i wish these were available when i wore a uniform. 5 stars all the way. very comfortable and perfect fit. i bought a medium size. and i love it. it just fit fine. i love the design of this. fine i\\'m a gay zebra surveyor. no, not a zebra surveyor that happens to be gay, but a surveyor that surveys gay zebras. i needed a pair of pants that can keep up with my active gay zebra surveying lifestyle. as a surveyor setting up focus groups for fortune 500,000 companies, i get paid to walk up to gay zebras, give them \\\\\\\\\"the look\\\\\\\\\", and chat them up enough until they\\'re comfortable answering a few questions (simple things like which moisturizers they tend to use, how they feel about universal health care, if ellen and portia make a good couple, etc.) the problem is, they immediately recognize me as human and start to prance away, and i\\'m betting it\\'s on account of the pants i wear. jeans? can\\'t! chinos? no, though hyenas respond well to those. corduroy? as if! finding a gay zebra to approach is tough enough, finding a gay zebra into humans is nearly impossible.    then i found the zubaz pants and they changed my life!    not only do they make me blend in perfectly with the gay zebra community in the african safari, but they let my junk flow freely. my junk being my fanny pack which i use to carry surveyor tools such as pens, pencils, mace, clipboards, paper, and the sisterhood of the traveling pants softcover. it\\'s a large fanny pack.    i highly recommend these pants to everyone in the gay zebra surveying community (todd and rusty.) my productivity has gone way up... and so has my popularity with the ladies. *wink* beautiful! really nice just to large. by at least one size. but over all they where great. love them they\\'ll work. my son is 2 and he is swimming in these.  he is between the 12th and 7th percentiles for weight and height (tiny parents), so if your child is on the smaller end keep that in mind.  they do stay up, but they are baggy and can sag with vigorous play.  they do their job, are soft, and absorbent when they need to be so no complaint there.  just keep sizing in mind! pants are warm but run extra large. i would buy a size smaller than what you normally wear. every time i wear them, someone stops me wanting to know where i found them.  these are totally my most comfortable pants and most complemented.  fit is to size or a little large. fits exactly like i hoped, girlfriend loves them fit of 9-12 months fits  my 27&#34;, 18lb baby prefectly. these at used for pajamas, i find this to be much easier to change diapers  with. nice cotton material. very comfortable. the fit was great, and i tend to wear it outside of exercise purposes. what can i possibly say about buttons that\\'s worth reviewing?  not much but the seller shipped them quickly and i got them in a couple of days.  i am using them for suspender buttons and they\\'re just the right size.  the color is neutral and works well with khaki pants.  not much of a review but good service and a great price on bdu buttons or suspender buttons as i use them is worth at least my time to say thanks. i like the banding on the bottom so i can roll up the length and it stays in place.  my son has shorter than average legs and wears cloth diapers so needs more room in the waist. after carefully reading the sizing info i ordered x-large (mostly basing on the waist measurements and the fact that it corresponds to us size 12 which i normally wear). turned out, xl was too large for me. the flatbelt measurement was off, in reality it was 18\\'\\' and not 17\\'\\' as listed by the seller. all other measurements matched the description. the pants are very roomy and no way i can wear them without a belt (cause of very wide waist; and i mean a real belt, the included rope is barely functional). they are also very long, so i\\'ll need to either get them shortened or use those little ropes at the bottom of their legs to tuck them in.<br /><br />i was hesitant to exchange them for a smaller size, because i was afraid it could be too small, and i wasn\\'t comfortable with waiting for 2+ weeks for the new pair to arrive (i was planning a long trip and thought i\\'d be gone by then). still, 2 weeks is pretty good for across the globe delivery, but a bit inconvenient for exchanges.<br /><br />they didn\\'t shrink after washing and drying on medium setting. i should\\'ve probably based my purchase on uk sizing, since i know i\\'m uk 14 and it would be their size l, not xl. love the feel amazingly soft fits in waste as expected but they are longer than normal. a little small but ok i love these pants! i\\'m a size 12 in regular pants and an 11/12 in junior jeans. i initially ordered these pants in black in xl but have sent them back to exchange them for an xxl. i could have kept the xl ones but the xxl are just a tiny bit larger and so are more comfortable for me. this color is perfect, they are like a second skin, but super comfortable and i am ready to order more in different colors! i am 5 ft. 4 in. so they are a tad bit long but i threw on some heels and no one noticed! i do have a rear end and these pants make it look amazing! i am not sure how they would look on someone that was flat but even if these pants do not miraculously life your cheeks, they will still make you look amazing. my husband is paying for the blue, red and the white ones, that\\'s how much he likes them! great work out pants and is true to the size. i use it not only for yoga but also for regular work outs and it very comfortable. these are the most comfortable pants ever! even though they are little tighter in my thighs than i previously thought they would be, these are still one of my favorite bottoms. i love lounging around the house in them, even if my thighs are a little too big for them. these pants feel great. my only complaint is that the seam at the crotch already looks like it might come apart soon. they fit nicely though and are very soft and fun to workout in. i love the high waisted pants and the look; i order 2 sizes bigger, still too small. got these for christmas present for my hubby who is a teacher.  he loves these pants.  comfortable and stylish.  great fit.  recommend. great gift excelente now i\\'m gonna break the wrist and wlk away... break the wrist and walk away.... you see what i did there? just got my pants today and i love them! first pair of high waisted pants ive ever owned. fit great! i am 5ft and 115 lbs have a big butt and thighs and i believe these style of pants look better on a girl with thighs and a butt not a stick. lucky me! :) will be buying more for sure!!! they fit so good  i wish i. had every  color  they don\\'t sag they fit snug an there long in length love them! super soft and cute but they are big. may be a little expensive for what they are so excited for this to arrive! adventure time is my top favorite show and jake is my favorite character! so yeah this is going to be great! love them :) they are very soft! the fabric is a little thin so i\\'m affaid they might rip. exactly what i was looking for!<br />thank you i absolutely love these pants! they are super cute and comfy, and fit just perfectly. i recently had a hysterectomy, and they were perfect to wear afterwards. no elastic, super soft, love them! i may order another pair just because i love these so much! this tuxedo onesie was very cute! it fit my son very well and he looked adorable in it. i got so many compliments on it and people asking where i got it from. i would definitely recommend this item to anyone. these are amazing! i order a second pair to make sure i have one while the other is washed. i am 5\\'5&#34; and 138lbs... i purchase the size small :)- very cool pants.  funky and comfy really warm and comfortable. i will order more. bought them for my son who\\'s a supernatiral fanatic. he won\\'t take<br />them off!! the pants sent from happy chef is well made, fits perfectly and is exactly what i have been looking for. i live in las vegas and we have plenty of summer. while white pants only fit a certain type of wardrobe, it is an excellent option to have available. this linen fabric has lots of character, and lots of space for a air to pass through.<br /><br />  when heavy clothes won\\'t do, this will. can be taken up,bought for my son , who loves anything that he thinks looks like walking dead gear. really good quality, he happens to be just a little  short in the leg area. also hot the shirt,if you get that ,go up a size. worth the money,made well. one word could describe my experience with these particular pants.  perfect!  beautiful dark purple color - perfect.  length - perfect.  i certainly understand those saying they\\'re too short, however, as i\\'m just 5\\'-0&#34; and hemming, for once, won\\'t be necessary.  (yay!)  overall fit - perfect.  to sum it all up i just want to make sure that the seller is included in this 5 star review.  package arrived unscathed and in record time.  thank you! absolutely love the fit.&#60;3 they are lightly laced with fleece, they do help keep you warm. my daughter and i love these these pants fit true to size; even though they look awfully small right out of the box. i was most excited to find a pair of petite size pants. the full belly covering band is not usually my preference because i find they are often too tight or too loose but this belly band fits comfortably and snugly. the pants don\\'t shift around and if my shirt hikes up a little then its nice to have that full band to keep everything covered. the fabric stretches well and i find the pants to be comfortable all day. they can be worn to work or around town; they go with everything. i\\'m probably going to buy a second pair in a different color. delicious tissue and fits perfect. finally!!!! pants that don\\'t have that stupid flap!!!!! hate that! love these pants and solow comfortable and sexy!!! love!! i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; 115 lbs petite and chose the xl size.  leggings are the right length for me and have some give so not too tight as others i\\'ve bought, though they do bag a bit in the knees.  skirt comes down to between 4-5 inches above knee which provides good coverage.  good for wearing around the house and on weekends. these pants were fantastic!  i was looking for a pair of yoga pants to wear as i track the growth of my pregnant belly.  these will still be great after my pregnancy too, the material seems better quality than i expected. perfect!! these are my new favorite pants!!! i love these! i was looking for something loose and cool to wear during the summer and these are exactly what i was looking for! the material is very lightweight and cool... very comfy to sleep in! i\\'ll probably be buying another pair in a different color! these pants are awesome, just what i have been searching for. used to wear eddie bauer pants of similar type but they are no longer available and these pants put the eddie\\'s to shame. they are high quality heavy duty material with plenty of pockets and a belt. i am ordering 2 more pairs.  ** love these pants ** they fit great! will definitely order more pairs! super fast shipping (arrived on sunday from the usps). the pants are really comfy and soft even after a few washes. the only downside is they don\\'t have pockets, but whatever they are awesome! very pleased, plan to buy many more! delivery was so fast - they arrived sooner than expected.  love the pants, especially the low waist.  i am 5\\'6 140 lbs (athletic build) and medium was a good size for me.  i generally wear 29/30 in pants and the waist on these particular pants was a little tight but that\\'s just because of the elastic cord in there.  the cord could stand to be longer so it doesn\\'t pinch so tight, but you could just cut the cord out or put a longer one in.  overall, i love how they fit and they are so soft and lightweight.  i will order another pair, just wish there were other colors. i always wanted to have this pants when i was a child and wasn\\'t so easy to find, now i have like 5 and looks like made of steel because they resist rain , dust and not so easy to break. i just got these. i got a medium, i\\'m 5\\'7 and ~123 lbs. i just wish they were a tiny bit longer. not see through, but pretty tight on the butt cheeks, lol. but i\\'m overall happy with them.<br /><br />edit: it\\'s been about a month and they got a tiny hole in the bum. so, not the best quality fabric. excellent it really is just for newborns...when baby gets a little bigger, there will be no way to use them to swaddle. also, i would prefer them to be square instead of rectangular. but they are super cute! perfect. fits great. material is thick. really great purchase. this is a good buy. i really was surprised with it. these pants are a perfect fit, extremely comfortable and look fantastic. paired with a linen tunic, these pants look terrific. forget the sweats!! i love these. they are my favorite hangin out pants with so many colors in them that you\\'re sure to have a shirt to wear. lightweight, loose gauzy material not too see- thru.elastic in waist and leg bottoms.definately for summer. they fit really well and are not see through at all. i am 120 pounds and 5\\'2 so i ordered the s/m because they stretch. they fit to perfection but if you are kinda big then the print will distort itself. vthese are some very sexy pants :-) they are very comfortable as well! fit perfectly, very happy....it\\'s time to go to the club! sexy pants! i\\'d love to get more for sure.. luv them i got these as a joke for my girlfriend and now the whole  school loves them. pattern is kind of awkward but no one cares my mom says these slacks are perfect for her, comfortable & easy to wash and wear. i bought these two outfit for a friends daughter.  the quality of both of these outfits were excellent, and i would buy again in the future. perfect for the recipient who is a true spongebob squarepants lover! i love bamboo clothes for my baby because they\\'re so soft.  this fits snugly on my 12.5 pound baby, but it has a lot of stretch, so he\\'ll be able to wear it for a while. love these pants üëñ they fit very good, i really like the colorful, they are very sexy, i used to wear them above my belly bottom just to fold a little bit the edge. thank you, excellent product very nice nothing spectacular but they are cute and are a heavier grade material than the cheap pairs you find in chain stores. still a little small, i wish there was a tad more stretch. i ordered mine at the end of september and wasnt expecting to recieve it untill november 12 but they came in today! im so happy and the product is exactly what i expected. :-) these fit very well, good quality. very pleased i loved the size it pretty flexible and would fit all sizes i am 86 kgs and its rubber waist would even fit bigger size,, the only thing that i wasnot bright as the pictute and it came in a dofferent colours i ordered these in large, i am 5\\'4, 140lbs and usually wear a size 8 in pants.  these are quite snug.  i ordered another pair in xl and they fit better.  i do wish they had front pockets.  they are also quite long on me.  that being said, i like them but would suggest ordering up a size or 2. these pants are so warm and comfortable! cute too, not your average sweat pants! i usually wear a medium but decided to order a large since the fit looked sort of tight on the model... mine are perfect without fitting like skimpy leggings! like it good quality material, nice easy fit, not clingy at all.  i like the green overband, wish that band had a little tighter elastic to it for daily wear but it works well as is, too. not sure what the other reviewers experienced with the calf portion of the pants, but they are meant to be tight.  if you take your time putting them on then there\\'s no issues with tightness.  my only gripe is the rope length, but cutting them down is easy, just be sure to burn the ends with a lighter/matches to avoid fraying. they fit perfectly. these feel like good quality fabric; size medium hits pretty much exactly at the floor, i am just over 5\\'6\\\\\\\\\". i haven\\'t had them long but they feel like they will last. would love to see a cropped or straight leg version for hot yoga practice! it was a hit... i received the pants very quickly and they are very comfortable! i am a girl so they are a little long but other than that they\\'re a great purchase. well made and they do make you sweat awesome these look great, fit great these woodland camo nylon/cotton ripstop bdu men\\'s pants are quite well designed and manufactured. the large size that i ordered will fit a 35\\\\\\\\\" to 41\\\\\\\\\" waist using straps on either side to adjust the waist.<br /><br />the hems of the pants can be adjusted around the boots snugly with ties. the leg pockets are huge, and all the pockets, two front and two rear, use buttons. slow but dependable and user repairable.<br /><br />the fabric of nylon and cotton is strong and should deal with abrasion well. don\\'t overheat while washing or drying (under 130f).<br /><br />they are forty-four us dollars at the moment. propper, the manufacturer, is the biggest uniform supplier to the american forces. they do it right. glad i got these. they should last a long time. recommended. i love them. i probably should have ordered medium. they fit but are a little loose. i usually wear a size 10 in pants. excellent! trying to buy every product the have. fix just like the picture! these are real, new  g.i. issue... no bull....the product is exactly what i ordered and wanted other than the fact the xl are too big for me but im gonna keep them anyway and get a lagre set too... loved the outfit, looks so cute thrilled with this purchase ..looks better then in photos ..arrived promptly and well packaged. if you are larger then size 6 jeans or taller then 5\\' 6\\\\\\\\\" it may not fit ..bit on small size ... the one sold as \\\\\\\\\"small to medium\\\\\\\\\" ...would recommend item and seller to anyone without hesitation. i don\\'t know about the few negative reviews posted ..for the price and service ..it\\'s excellent value ..just as long as you make sure would fit your size ... really comfortable nice fit and love wearing day or nite as i said for the other pair, granddaughter loves them, they fit perfectly. exactly as described greate.. the fabric for the price its really amaizing i have bought these pants before, and i ordered a different color because i absolutely love them!  they\\'re very long, so if you\\'re tall with long legs and have trouble finding pants to fit these would be perfect.  i have a 36&#34; inseam and these fit perfectly.  the material is not really light weight like you find in some yoga pants, so they cling nicely like they\\'re supposed to and hold their shape nicely.<br /><br />i will be ordering other colors! fun pants/leggings they just run small. you will need to size up 1 size. love this jumper. fits very comfortably! if you have bigger breast, you may need extra support. love them the color is not as it appears on the photo. i was disappointed and returned them. the color was closer to a dodger blue or true blue, not baby blue or sky blue as in the picture. love love love!! pretty color, great fit, comfortable. the pants fit wonderfully and the material is nice and breathable. the only issue i have is the zipper. it\\'s in a lightning bolt shape with sharp edges that poked a hole in one of my shirts. that\\'s my only issue. i ordered 2 of the same kind of yoga pants yet they have 2 different labels in them and fit entirely different. i like the way the royal blue fit much better. the grey are slightly a little looser than i like . also all yoga pants i find are very very long..they should be made for all heights of people! great quality. the blue is vibrant with a crisp white. i really like this pair of jazz pants. it fits my daughter perfectly!  (i used the sizing chart from another online dancewear seller to choose the size.) as another reviewer said, the material is a little shiny, but i don\\'t mind. these are wonderful training pants. not small at the thigh like gerber. i washed them first before i put them on my little one(why would you put them on your child without washing them first) and they held up great in the wash. they do tend to run a little small, so order a size up. will be ordering more. legs were a little long, but very comfy nonetheless. the recpient was most happy with the sweat pants and top. it fit how i like my night pants to fit a little big but i\\'m a small girl i fit in size 3 or 4 in juniors and i got a medium. they are so comfy and warm! love these. just wish they had more colors. comfy i am wearing them now. smaller than expected around crotch...so i have to wear long tops, and very long legs. i am 5\\'8&#34; and typically wear 32/33 length. even pulled up as far as possible, cuffs drag and need to be hemmed. nice fabric. i would buy again. perfect yoga pant! i purchased like 5! super comfy and has a nice fold over for the cupcake muffin top :) these are the real deal, but i agree with others that reviewed the item. i am normally a medium regular and these are just a tad to long. no worries though they will still be just fine. great product and would buy them again! i bought these for my wife for christmas and she loves them. the fit is tailored, but not too tight. they look good and she says they feel great. i have bought a few item before.. they are fast , reliable and dependable quality is excellent and definitely order again i highly recommend this products thank you! good price and very comfortable. i was tired of paying for disposable pull ups while filling land fills.  and at the same time my 3 1/2 yr old still not trained.  so i went to these, and magically the world of potty training is just about over.  she is a big girl (her dad is 6\\'7) so i was afraid the xxl wouldn\\'t fit her...they do fine!  so glad i made the switch!!!  and of course if you leave them in these even with a plastic cover pant, you will get pee all over, but these are not diapers and your child should communicate with you they are wet, or you should be on top of it yourself checking. these run small and are a little short in the waist.  so order a larger size if you don\\'t want them to be tight but i do like them and they were a great price.  they are a good piece to have in the wardrobe. i was a little hesitant to buy these pants since there were no reviews for me to get a feel for how the sizing and fit would be, but i went ahead and ordered a pair anyway just based on the sizing chart. i\\'m 5\\'6, 140lbs, usually a size 7, so per the chart i ordered a size medium, and the fit of the pants is great. they\\'re long enough and fit in the waist. also, the material is pretty stretchy so i would say they won\\'t have to fit everyone perfectly in order to make them work, if you get close they should do just fine! these pants are bright and vibrant and colored just like in the picture. i can\\'t wait to wear them! this was one of the things my daughter wanted for her 25th birthday. she\\'s thrilled with them!! ty she\\'ll be wearing them for her workouts or just to shock people with the unusual. :) after extensive testing we love these bdus. we\\'re former military officers who think these low-key black bdus are great. they retain military standards but have been upgraded to fit our current needs. they fit well and are built for superior endurance. one niggling complaint: the shipping charge is much higher than the ups cost of shipping these in an envelope. so, 4.5 stars.<br /><br />8/26/10 update: we\\'d now give these 5+ stars. we use these bdu\\'s daily for field work. we\\'ve owned our first black pairs of these bdus for over a year and have reordered a few times. comments: [1] management responded to our comment after our second order about high shipping cost by slashing shipping charges by ~half. [2]the left front quad pocket is perfect size for a military spec brute cell phone with direct connect allowing for hands free communication with the oem telephone ear bud. [3] the heavy duty 2\\\\\\\\\" black nylon web belt that we\\'ve received with these bdu\\'s is a great bonus. [4] have worn these on 100+ degree days in full sun while working.  they are black.  they are hot under these conditions, but no more so than a standard pair of unfaded levi\\'s and are more functional. [5] the fabric these bdus are made of is top grade. if turned inside out when washing, they come out of the dryer looking pressed and seem to be wrinkle proof and highly fade resistant. they also shed water, lint, stains and most brush and thorns as if they were made of iron, yet are as comfortable as a favorite old pair of jeans and provide a greater range of motion. these were a great buy but, they did seem to run a little short in my opinion.  they were really cute and soft and our little guy wore them as long as possible. nice purchase and holding up well. i really liked the outfit right size, the color is beautiful, and i like the weight of the material the outfit well be very comfortable for him. fits well. they look just a little different from the pic, but still cute i just receieved this items via ups. the pants are wonderful. i love the fabric and the fit is too a tee. i\\'m going on vacation in a couple of weeks and these are surely going to really come in handy. i think they can dressed up with a nice blouse and blazer. love them! i ordered a large ,love them got this as a present for my friend\\'s son and she absolutely adores it. the fabric is so soft and comfortable. i have two pairs of these:  black and dark grey.  i have been living in them since mid-second trimester.  i felt the regular length was adequate, but when i got my second pair i ordered longs.  i then cut them to custom length with scissors, so that they fit a little more to my liking.  the scissor cut has not frayed at all, and it actually just curled up a little.  they look really cute.  the high belly has expanded nicely, and it gives a nice support too. daughter loves them thanks perfect fit my son says these are comfortable but he wishes they had pockets like his other flannel pjs. it\\'s hard to find 100% cotton plaid flannel pants for kids, so we were glad to find these. great fit! soft and cozy. my girls love them. i love it so much give mi a lil butt just how i like<br />it can\\'t wait to order more definitely gonna be my go to store thanks much these tights are constructed to fit perfectly, like an expensive pair of department store leggings. they are durable, fleece lined, not see through, very comfortable, looks great under a skirt with high boots or low ones. it\\'s hard to find good tights like these! the fabric is super thin, so it\\'s a nice lightweight piece of clothing, perfect for summer, but i have yet to see how well it holds up in the wash (i\\'m not into high-maintenance clothing, and i plan to put it in the washer and dryer).  i usually wear size 14 in pants, and it fit perfectly.  also, quite long (basically floor length), but i\\'m 5\\'11&#34;, so i think it\\'s a perfect length and won\\'t be modifying it at all.  i expect to wear these pants a lot! i love america and these leggings are perfect for my 4th of july outfit this year!  people expect a lot from my festive outfits and these will help me do the job! i never knew about the cargo sweat pants, i thought one can only get dockers.  this is amazing.  what i like about the cargo version is that i can carry my phone and wallet in a different pocket. these are nice, great fit, and have a slimming effect! i wear them in a dressy way, but purchased a second pair for the house! i really like these jeans,they fit well and i get so many compliments when i wear them. i live out in the country and duck dynasty is kind of a big deal here so i always pair it w/one of my favorite dd shirts and my pink detailed mossy oak cap-just adorable. i have purchased many lanacare items and been extremely pleased with them, and this one is no exception.  we own many, many wool diaper covers/pants, and this is one of the nicest ones we have - one of the first that i reach for.  made of super soft, slightly felted organic merino wool.  the weight is warm but not so insanely thick that your baby will never wear them (works great for fall/winter/spring here in the sf bay area, both indoors and out).  when i read the review about these pants being like a \\\\\\\\\"toaster\\\\\\\\\" i was a bit worried, but if you just use these as the outer layer (rather than as a midweight layer) they are fine for moderately cold weather (50s-60s f).  they aren\\'t windproof, so i would not wear them on their own in really cold weather.  the adjustable waistband is genius.  the cut through the legs is a pretty baggy, even over a cloth diaper (sort of the equivalent of baby sweatpants) - but it works fine for us.  if you prefer a super slim fit though you probably want to go with something else.  in my experience, the sizing in these runs quite big.  we purchased the size 74 (6-9mo) for our somewhat chunky 9.5mo old (28\\\\\\\\\", 20 lbs)  and there is still lots of room to grow...they\\'re a bit too long (actually sort of a problem - the material is so stretchy that if he gets a toe caught in the cuff, he easily trips on them) and the size 80 would definitely have been too big.  if you plan to felt this item further you should size up, otherwise i would recommend sizing down 1 size.  there are lots of pictures of babies of different ages/sizes wearing different sizes of these pants on the green mountain diapers website that i found quite helpful...they made me comfortable with ordering a size down.  just google the \\\\\\\\\"green mountain diapers\\\\\\\\\" site, and select \\\\\\\\\"lana merino wool pants\\\\\\\\\" on the home page.<br /><br />---<br /><br />update: our son is now 22mo old (albeit a little on the small side - approx 32\\\\\\\\\", 26 lbs) and the size 74 (size 6-9mo) still fits.  the lengthis just a tad short, but the waist/hips are fine (due to the roomy fit and adjustable waist) and they\\'re still great for indoor wear and naps.  so yes, these are pricey, but these definitely have some serious longevity.  still very soft and nice after a fair amount of wash and wear (i recommend hand washing in eucalan or similar, and laying flat to dry). i got the o.d. color; shade as expected. the material is lighter than standard issue, but for me that\\'s a plus. great for spring and fall outdoor activities. i\\'ve hiked hilly terrain in them (10 mi.) and worn them around town. they are roomy, comfortable and provide great range of movement. as a former marine, the first thing i did was cut to off the webbing ties at the ankles and use blousing bands instead (for outdoor use). be ready to trim irish pennants. double layered butt and knees. 60% cotton - 40% polyester. made in haiti. will buy again. very modern and stylish, fits perfectlyyyy but runs small a littele bit..order bigger than ur size, highly recommend it. thank you i\\'m not a junior... but these fit perfect. good deal for the money... these are thicker than most yoga pants so i feel more secure and less see through in them. i like the gray color as well. it\\'s a nice change from the typical black. gift for husband -- and he loves them!  thank you! these are the most comfortable and affordable lounge pants, i will be buying more. i do wish they had pockets though, no biggie though. on size fits all is right! love the shorts, ordered a few more in different colors because i was so happy with the ones i originally received. great service as well it fits, i just had to hem it up but thats because im short. its worth the price the shorts are somewhat small but acceptable. i get a lot of compliments on them and their very comfortable. my only regret is not buying 2 pair. so happy with this purchase. i\\'m 5\\'7 - 132lbs - i bought a size 7 and they fit perfectly. snug in all the right areas and just long enough for 3in heels.<br />soo i bought the same pant in a different color. these pants are just what i wanted.  thin and comfortable.  i am pleased with purchase.<br />(they are thin enough you can somewhat see through them, that is what i was looking for for an upcoming trip)they fit well and are true to size, the color is also very nice. capri pants it works well.  i would like to order another one, so one can be in use while the other one is being washed. i got these for my husband.  he wears them often and looks so sexy cool in them! these pants are adorable but they are a slim fit. my 3 month old baby outgrew them in about 3 weeks. they are definitely for the smaller percentage of babies who are long and lean. great quality and the color matched our other babysoy onuses perfectly. but tight in the hips...could be that i just need to lose weight!! ha!  only real draw back is the material is thin, but logo design is pretty stylish. i bought pants one size larger than my size and they fit me perfectly.  they are very comfortable. i would recommend. these fit perfectly everywhere except for the length but that is an easy fix. i am about 5\\'6 and they cover my feet. they are soft and do not show through either. i love them. love these! just what i expected, i only wish they came in petite length. i\\'m 5\\'0&#34; and had to have them hemmed of course. i bought a pair of these in florida (white) and just loved them as all around jammies, beach pants or general lazy day pants....then, i found on amazon and bought a pair (black) for home, these even more versatile, and most recently i bought a 3rd pair during my pregnancy...i just love these pants.  they wash and dry well.  i am a size 4-6 and bought medium, pregnant bought large :) i have owned a pair of these for a few months now and just as the description says, i want to wear nothing else! the material is very durable, extremely comfortable, flexible, and appropriately stretchy. the material is not however breathable at all i would say. you will sweat more, get hotter, and feel a bit more fatigue but thats why i like them for training pants. they\\'re relatively light, the pocket zippers are much appreciated, and so is the adjustable waist band and cuffs. iv wanted another pair since the first time i trained with these and would definately reccommend! very nice and good quality.  material is a little thicker than i expected, but very nice. they fit but not as long as i thought they were going to be love them!! sent black and i ordered grey. otherwise fit and look nice. its perfect for sleepy, know its my prefer pijama.  the only bad its that know i need the sweater similar excellent quality. fit great and feel wonderful. thin, but sexy. plus size compatible. i bought these pants in the hot topic store and they fitted great i wear a size 9/10 ussaly and the pair i have is all torn and worn out and every thing! but they dont sell my size on amazon t_t please restock received these today and put them on straight away.  i ordered the dark green color size l29.  they are cute.  the fabric is nice.<br />i am 5\\'2&#34; which is petite.  petites are for people who are 5\\'4&#34; and under.  these pants are in no way petite.  you will be hemming if you are short.  i expected that from the reviews, so ok.<br />also, juniors means that the cut should be for girls who are not children but also not fully womanly through the hips and thighs.  so the slim fit description is somewhat accurate.<br />these days i have been wearing jeans with 28 waist.  this is sort of between a 4 and a 6 so choosing the right size for these and going up 1 size was sketchy.  i wanted to buy 1 size up but i am between sizes so i couldn\\'t.  so these are not really a full size larger but also not humongous if i bought xxl.  the waist is good but the butt and upper thigh is snug.  hopefully they will loosen up and i could stand to drop a pound or two.  they still look just fine thanks to the pockets in the rear.  i wanted baggy but not swimming in them. perhaps they would be if i got xxl but then the waist would be really big so i chanced the large.<br />hope that helps anyone trying to figure out if they should get these. great pants, not much else i could talk about when your on the subject of such. would i suggest them to anyone ? yes if you need a pair that are large then yes ofc! i expected jeggings, i didn\\'t think they would be actual leggings with just an appearance of jeans. i\\'m still very happy with this product. love these pants!! so comfortable. perfect for yoga or around the house. i am 5\\'3&#34; and 135lbs. i ordered xl and they fit perfect. this is my second pair. i want more! at 5\\'4&#34;, i have trouble finding pants that don\\'t drag on the ground.  these pants are very comfortable and pretty well-made.  you can fold over the top or not depending on how far along you are.  if they still stay up post-delivery i might just keep them forever and wear them with the top folded down. love them these are super super comfy!!! i love the material and the fact that i\\'m 5\\'9 and ordered a small and they are still long enough, i don\\'t feel like i\\'m wearing floods and that\\'s super important. nice pants for the baby. soft, lightweight and fits chunky babies with cloth diapers. loved it!!!!! cute jeggins, extra long and very comfy... minus the tag.. it\\'s itchy n i had to remove it i love these pants! the material is really comfortable, but still looks elegant and nice. these are see through you should know this. they do look like the picture, but they run small, even short. i am 5\\'1\\'\\' and i can wear them with practically flat shoes, also i am a med and these run as tight as a small on me, maybe sew some fringe  or lace on the bottom of cuff, have white panties available and  order a size bigger than you normally wear :} hope this was helpful!! aloha love the fit it holds me well and even though the fabric is light, there is zero visible cellulite and no muffin top. also don\\'t have to worry about your top going up and showing skin will buy it again. the most comfortable capri\\'s that i own..<br />a+a+a+a+a+a+a+a+a+a+a+<br />too bad you can\\'t buy all pants this nice and fit just right...<br /><br />awesome!!!!! these pants are so compfy you dont know they are there! i love them....the fit is great and u can wear them to the office or out on the town. i just may have to go back and order a pair in every color!!!  highly recommended. love them long skirt. my fianc√© loves these! i purchased them as his christmas present! i think these footies are perfect for a newborn. they are soft, and stretchy, easy to put on, and very comfortable. the only thing i will point out is that they aren\\'t super-warm‚Ä¶this is perfect for us, as we live in california, and swaddle her as well. just thought id give a heads-up to those cold-weather-new-parents. yoga pants super comfortable !!!!!!! i love fleece pj\\'s and i would say the best i ever yet bought ....love this warm enough and sooooo comfortable.....it is also lightweight for a fleece..... recomended!!!!! in my opinion, otomix workout pants are perhaps the best i\\'ve used, being thin and high quality. unfortunately, i\\'m not sure i want to have too many pants with all of those funky designs. i think that they should also make more simple solid-color ones. perfect fit, really comfortable, laundries just fine. i wear these all the time: dress \\'em up, dress \\'em down, wear to the country, wear into town! oh, and they respond beautifully to the body movements of yoga. i recommend these pants to everybody, and they\\'ll stay a mainstay in my wardrobe for as long as the company\\'s in business. one thing: i\\'m 5\\'7&#34; and at first ordered regular length, which was too short. so, i gave them as a gift and ordered myself the tall version; glad i did. also, hang mine to dry to avoid lint and extend fabric life. not bad not good they fit kind of weird but i still like them because i like weird stuff so they are really comfy too and nice cold material  it feels cool when you put it on like cold or something haha ! but i love them anyways just kind of awkward fitting like saggy in the butt , but i think that\\'s the point so yeah get them if u want some relaxing pants to just chill in and look cute around doing domestic stuff ... i wouldn\\'t wear these out to party or anything like that but to school yeah on those days u just roll out of bed and leave the house these would be good for that as well :) these pants are great for a new baby.  they\\'re soft and stretchy for those days that you don\\'t want to dress your baby in a sleep and play.  plus the colors are lovely and they wash well. very comfortable and just the right height on my hips. i bought another pair. i wear them alot and love the material loved it! great! very comfy sweatpants i am so happy with these crop pants. they fit perfect - especially with the adjustable drawstring (if i gain or loose wait). i wear them to work out, yoga, dance class and just lounging around the house. i get compliments on the fluo pink graphic all the time.  :)    i highly recommend this product from ecozuzu!! the fabric is soft, but not durable. that\\'s okay though, i just lounge around in them and they\\'re very good for dancing.  a tad bit short, but my legs are long anyways. love them. fantastic pants and arrived much sooner than expected. they are a bit sheer, but perfect for the beach or worn with a long tunic. a great experience shopping with siam secrets- highly recommended. perfect sizing and all works great very soft and comfy! i bought these for my son a few months ago to try and keep the poor kid\\'s pants on since no belts are made small enough for his tiny waist. even for my 2-year-old who likes to shed clothing, these work wonderfully! love them! i am a us size 10 - 12 and 5ft 6. i ordered the xxl. whilst i wouldn\\'t necessarily say a size 10 is xxl, but i somehow knew this would be the fit for me. anyway, they were delivered quickly and are really flattering and comfy. they also look smart. i\\'m really pleased with this purchase, especially for the price. they are adorable! great quality a bit on the the smaller side for 0-3 months. but one of my favorite items i\\'ve ordered. so soft and cute. i like the fabric color and texture. it fits loosely allowing for free movement without binding as i go through the day\\'s chores. pretty enough to wear out, easily dressed up. works well in combination with emfraa thermal base layer this winter around the house and for brief forays outside. i look forward to seeing if it is comfortable in the summer heat. very comfortable, fit great!! all good these pants are so cute and feel so good on. i am so happy i bought them. they look better in person than in the picture. i think if they had the model wearing more of a heel than those big block shoes than you could see how awesome these pants are. i will buy again from this store. thanks! if your baby is like mine, she won\\'t like to be covered with a blanket even when it\\'s pretty cold out. these pants have been very handy now that the weather can be temperate in the day but a little chilly at night. we put them on over her onesies and she doesn\\'t mind them. they are pretty good quality thick cotton. the band at the ankles helps keep socks on by hiding the tops of the socks so baby can\\'t use her other foot to slough them off. i usually keep a pair of pants in the diaper bag. you never know when it will get a little too chilly for bare baby legs.also lightweight enough to put on if you\\'re going to be in the woods on a nice day, but you don\\'t want mosquitos and other bugs feasting on your offspring. use the light colored ones in the woods, so you can keep an eye on ticks and whatnot. my thighs are a little big, but it\\'s fine i\\'m working on making them smaller, but the material is nice and soft, and they look great on my best friend. if you have larger thighs, like between sizes 7+ they might not be for you unless you plan on working out a bit. but my friend is a size 0-3 and he looks great in them. i recommend to the smaller group (i wish i could recommend to the &#34;average&#34; size). had these before.......just ordering a couple more.....grand kids liked them as much as i did so they are gone and i have to replace them. so happy with this for the baby.  i bought 2 more in other colors.  lightweight and so soft,  it\\'s perfect, oi mates- these are an excellent pair o\\' bumbags fer those what needs t\\' buy em. if ye can\\'t plunder em, says i! i acquired a pair fer me crew, i did- now me crew is prone t\\' lose their pants at a moment\\'s notice, they are! yet these pants can be passed amongst th\\' crew and worn by all sorts o\\' miscreants, an\\' look good on all o\\' them! the drawstring waistband allows them to be snugged up, yet feature easy escape. the buttons on the legs let em be worn with stockin\\'s n\\' buckle shoes, er stuffed in a pair o\\' bucket boots, er even look good w i\\'bare feet!(fer walkin\\' those caribbean beaches)<br />aye- roomy an\\' comfortable...these be a wonderment fer holystonin\\' th\\' deck, careenin\\' th\\' ship, swordfightin with the local constabularly, escapin\\' from said local constabulary, gettin caught by the royal navy...and t\\' look yer best when brought up on charges at the magistrates dock! an\\' if it goes badly fer ye there- well, they can be passed on t\\' another member o\\' th\\' crew sure!  savvy? the capri pants fit perfectly.  i am satisfied with the product. i like these. the inner lining is not attached, so it isn\\'t as comfortable as unlined capris (but they have a different function, so....). also, i would prefer an outer fabric that\\'s not quite so 80\\'s shiny. they look a little more &#34;solid gold dancer&#34; than i like. that said, they do hold in heat and make you sweat. i like the fact that they don\\'t have that weird smell like some of the neoprene things and they don\\'t make noise when i walk. purchased for my father, who had gained so much weight i couldn\\'t find his size locally.  these pants fit the bill.  and he loved them.  really good quality and fit well, true to size. the kalon yoga pants are well made, the right size and length.  they have not twisted or become misshapen after a few washings.  the price was excellent also.  so many big name brands are charging $70.00 and above for a pair of their mediocre yoga pants. looks good feels good i love these palazzo pants. they are super comfortable. the colors are so vibrant and they wash well and dry quickly on a hanger and need no ironing. they are a little long for me. perfect fit..... want to buy some more but there is no colour option my girl is 5\\'3&#34;, 117 lbs, cute little figure... she looks totally hot in these!!  they\\'re nice and tight, the print is fun!! dressy top or casual top, just add the high heals, and they\\'re super sexy and fun.  totally stoked with this purchase!! very soft, and very comfortable. i bought a size that i would normally wear and they fit very well.  sometimes when you buy a size in an article of clothing, you are shocked to find they don\\'t fit, especially with this stretching kind of fabric, but these are great.  the stretch is soft and comfortable, no itching at all. i will buy more. i could not believe how amazingly american i feel in my new usa pants i buy. they make me feel like a smoking sexy with a fragrance of mid west farm and greasy fatso foods. if you are from another places then usa, then buy the pants to wear and feel the great connection for why everyone hate this beautiful country. usa hey hey hey usa hey hey hey!!! true, this is a bit pricey for a diaper cover, but in my experience, it\\'s well worth the extra money.  the material of these bloomers is super-soft against my toddler\\'s skin and the elastic fits around her thighs without being too tight or constricting.  plus, the ruffle in the back is adorable.  lately, my daughter has taken to pulling off the tabs on her diapers whenever they\\'re exposed, so these bloomers make the perfect diaper cover for her to wear under skirts that don\\'t come with built-in undershorts.<br /><br />grade: a these pants are so comfortable and so soft.  i will be buying more! i received so many compliments on them i love the fit nd the feel....got a lot of compliments i love it!!!  can\\'t wait to wear it. the shirt fits great! just as expected. the only issue i had was there were a few tiny strings on the shirt and when i took it off, paint from the print came off with it. thanks i bought these to have nice flowy dance pants for nia classes, and they are great!  i love dancing in them and get lots of compliments on them in class.  even though i work up a sweat, they don\\'t feel too hot.  i gave 4 stars because the material is pretty thin.  these only come in one size, i normally wear a size 0-2 in pants, 5\\'4\\\\\\\\\", so they probably are best if you normally wear smaller sizes and aren\\'t very tall. i love these! they arrived today and are too large but are very high quality and nice and of a thick material. i am 5\\'7&#34; and 165, i ordered the m and they were much too baggy so i\\'m hoping to exchange them for a small. i had space in the waist, bagging at the knees and crotch as soon as i put them on.<br /><br />the heather brown is darker than it appears in the picture, almost a gray, but i am still happy with them. a great product, but it does run large! i may even buy them in the olive heather, too. those pants fit my curves, i\\'m 5ft 6in an i weigh 125pounds, my measurements are 26in waist, 33in hips, and 38 1/2in booty. i\\'m amazed a medium fit me perfectly but it did!!! bought these for my son. he wanted something to wear around the apartment on the weekends that had pockets he could put his keys in when he went down to the laundry room. great feel and fit but definitely a size smaller than stated.  the small i ordered fits like an extra small but the feel nice and look flattering.  ordering more! this time i went up two sizes and they are perfect. great fit, very silky (thin) material so it falls pretty nice... it looks just like the picture!the really parachute-ey part is really around the waist though. also, these may not look good with a tucked in shirt because the band is really plain. perfect!! love the material!! first maternity clothing purchase i ever made and soo worth it.  stylish, flattering, oh-so extraordinarily soft and comfy i wear them almost non-stop! like the gray waistband- has adjusted and fit perfectly from very early to late weeks of pregnancy!! i\\'m 5\\'2\\\\\\\\\"/ 5\\'3\\\\\\\\\" and the length was perfect.<br /><br />only giving 4 stars bc the lengthwise leg seam came undone and i\\'ve had a sizeable \\\\\\\\\"hole\\\\\\\\\" growing there since my very first day wearing.  quick stitch should fix and overall rest of quality/ fabric great and no other issues.<br /><br />would but again for sure! my wife loves them! it¬¥s so comfortable and real demin look fit as expected (just like photo). drawstring is non-functional but waistband fits fine. not as thick as regular sweatpants but cozy & comfy. they run a little small i bought these training pants for my 3-year-old daughter because they are a bit thicker than &#34;regular&#34; panties.  the overall size was mostly as expected.  however, the leg openings are a bit tight (as others have described in previous reviews), so you have to be careful with the ordering.  i sized up to 4s instead of 3s in anticipation of tight leg openings, and if i hadn\\'t, my daughter would not have been able to fit them, and she is fairly thin.  what i love about the training pants though is the thickness; it helped my daughter learn to &#34;hold it&#34; better than regular panties (for whatever reasons).  she has never had an accident with them, which i cannot say for thinner underpants! perfect these were on my grandsons baby registry and they love them. they washed them first and they did not shrink and held their shape. i ordered more and they love them. ***** thank you good beautiful, very good queality! bought it for my almost 2 year old granddaughter, was very comfortable, soft, looking beautiful. i love this material and the fit was perfect!! very soft and comfy great fit, nice light weight material.<br />fit very true to size. i love these!!! they fit great. the other reviewer stated they are lose at the bottom, but mine are great. the bottom is banded just like other popular joggers out there. some joggers have the black banded bottoms but these are cool and are the same color as the rest of the joggers. i am 5\\'2 and 120. small fits me fine. god bless :) i don\\'t remember seeing that these were low hip hugging type. i would prefer a higher waist and a selection as to length of pants. i love it so much, i took off the elastic and put another black string in it and now its perfect. wear these constantly when running in cols weather.  i thought the stirrups would be bothersome, not the case.  great piece of kit. these fit me perfectly in the waist and length considering i\\'m 6\\'. usually pants shink and no longer fit me after the first wash but they held there length. very comfy too. love these pants. so comfortable, cool and pretty. the thermals arrive quickly and were just what i needed to get through cold evenings at football games. very cozy! the pants look great and feel like they\\'re made of smooth, quality material. t-party shipped them quickly and i received them in good time. they look just as pictured (i bought the grey pair).<br /><br />i normally wear a size 14 (fitting) or 16 (loose) in levi\\'s jeans, and i would say the l size for these yoga pants fit me very, very snug. which is okay, 14 is the upper end of &#34;l&#34; size anyway usually, and yoga pants can sometimes give a good snug fit. it really smooths out everything and makes the fit look great, which is important to me if you want to wear yoga pants &#34;out&#34; to run errands or as everyday wear.<br /><br />for working out though, i probably would have preferred a slightly looser fit. it would be really awesome if the seller could carry an additional size up too, for ladies who may wear the l size, but would like a looser fit - i would probably buy multiple colors of both sizes then!<br /><br />regardless these pants are great quality especially for the price and will look good when worn! love these pants!!<br />they are so comfortable but yet stylish as well. you can dress down or dress them up!<br />by the size chart i should wear a medium, but after reading the reviews that they run a little small i decided to play it safe and get the large & they were just right!<br />i ordered the coral & it is beautiful... a little deeper color than i expected but still beautiful!<br />i loved these pants so much that i had to have them in mocha too & it is a beautiful color as well....<br />i\\'m expecting i\\'ll try other colors as well!!<br />another plus is no hem so you can cut to your specific length!<br />you can\\'t go wrong with these pants!!  just be sure when ordering to order up. looks like everyday jeans, but a bit warmer!  the ties on the leg cuff didn\\'t last, but i did not use them either. the material is a little thin so your skin can breath. they are soft and very comfortable,  i love them! i strongly recommend this product.  it\\'s very confortable and good quality. the size is perfect. the material is soft and very flexible. these are my 3rd pants that i\\'ve bought within 4 months.  i have hip joint pain problems due to having radiation from uterine cancer etc..   these pants help my lower half when i belly dance with them.  it really helps my joints and legs to feel so much better as i work out and dance in them.  normally, i tire out really quickly and when these pants are on, i can go twice as long working out!  when i take the pants off, they are sopping wet from my exertion.  i highly recommend these pants to the ladies who have problems with their lower half of their bodies. mostly too long. i got a med. i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; 125lbs. but they look great and are very comfortable. excelent very soft and perfect fit. excellent quality and they are warm and not bulky.  you can wear them over your regular clothes and still work comfortably in them. definately would recommend them to friends. i bought these for my son, based on the sizing measurements provided for these pants; however, they were at least 3 inches too short, and they were very tight.  otherwise, the pants are nice.  i would recommend buying them, just look at their sizing chart and then go one size bigger.  if you buy the pants based on the measurements provided, your pants will be too small. as shown in the photo, these slacks are really soft and feels nice on the skin.  i am tall 5\\'8\\\\\\\\\" so i prefer that my shirt sleeves, skirt and slacks fit long. i also have hips so they were a snug but still complimented my shape.  i figured after i stop eating a few doughnuts (that i love so much), my tush will be able to fit into the slacks very nicely.  if you are at least 5\\'8 - 5\\'9\\\\\\\\\" these slacks will come down to the floor.  a must buy. somewhat large but it\\'s okay.. these are my favorite yoga pants on earth! nice i\\'m a big fan of printed drop-crotch pants and these fit perfectly everywhere and work as a casual piece or a dressy piece. goes well with lots of types of shoes as well. my favorite ! my daughter wears a size 7 and is pretty thin.  these pants fit her fine around the waist, but they were still too long for her and she is actually in the 75th percentile for her height.  the dance teacher just pinned them up for her.  other than that, they\\'re fine. these seem well made and are super cute! my grandson is just 1 month so we don\\'t know how they fit, the smallest size to order was 6 months.  i think they will be adorable on him. super cute can\\'t wait to wear it. these pants are great, soft and good quality. they do shrink considerably upon first wash! very cute. nice quality they are comfortable and made out of nice strong material, easy to move in, and fit wonderfully. the legs of the pants are on the longer side, which is great for me because i have long legs, probably not great for shorter women. i was willing to pay this much for yoga pants because petite sizes are hard to find.  i wear p8-p10, and sometimes seem to fall between ps and pm for a good fit.  pm was the right choice for these.  they seem well-made; i just ran them through the washer/dryer with no change in the fabric or fit.  i can\\'t give this transaction 5 stars because of frustration with delivery.  i knew it would be longer than normal, but when i got a notice 3 days after ordering that it had left the seller\\'s facility, my expectations were that it would arrive at the early end of the range, and hopefully well before that.  it finally arrived just under the wire for the end date, leaving me to wonder where it had been in the weeks between leaving the seller and actually being shipped?!!  it was a long wait when needing them for a new yoga class. i am medium build, 5\\'8&#34; & 135 lbs, and the size medium fits perfectly! just as i expected. love them! i don\\'t like legging that are one size fits most. these are too great for me not to squeeze into. they look great! i have this jacket in a rose color.  my sister gave it to me, and it is my favorite jacket in the whole world.  she kept the pants, i guess, because i didn\\'t know it was a set.  but, that\\'s okay, because it is easier to find a pair of pants than a great jacket like this one.  it is very comfortable; love the quilted lining, and the button pockets.  many times, i will throw this on and stuff my money and stuff in the pockets and go without using a handbag.  so easy when running errands, and i might be forgetful.  if i could ever find it again in my size, i would get more colors. nice little pants for the little tike to wear in a wedding!  they were delivered on time which was a concern.  the pants were a great fit and the material was very comfortable.  the seller did a great job! got these for my husband.  they are a real nice quality and fit perfectly.  have washed them many times and they still look new. nice pants but wanted a loose fit. love the leopard print, love the fine quality of the cotton. have these in several colors & designs, & i\\'m not embarrassed to be seen in them outside with the dog. i\\'m 5\\'10 and they were around 4 inches too long, the fabric is kinda thin, but they are comfy. my daughter loves these pj\\'s!  the fabric is very soft and the &#34;bearly awake&#34; design is cute. so useful and cute! super comfy and beautiful pattern these chef pants are perfect, got my chef hat and apron from this company as well, now along with my chef coat, these pants, hat and apron, i got all the rights clothes to wear while cooking, let alone all the utensils to cook my food with in the kitchen, this is where you buy all chef and kitchen attire and knives too if you don\\'t want to go to wal-mart.<br /><br />i say like my new happy chef, chef pants, thanks again great jeans true size. it fits very well and jeans look very stylish. definately going to buy a second pair of grey ones since i bought the black ones and im very pleased with it. ok not at all see through, good quality, and excellent fit good pants awesome pants!  i\\'m 5\\'9&#34; 120lbs and can never find yoga pants that fit and are long enough.  these are absolutely perfect. i will be buying more! my daughter loves these leggings! i love these they\\'re cute i ordered 0-3months i know they\\'ll look cute on ma son... i was pleasently surprised of the 11-12 years size and will keep these for future use as the child ages nice fit for a young teen girl and she can grow into them.  very comfy! so recived these pants in the mail and tried them on and feel in love i have two pairs now white and neon and they are so amazing . very comfterble and make your ass look great :) my boyfriend loves when i wear these jeans . it\\'s a must in your closet nice look, fit and feel.  i wish they didn\\'t come out of the dryer needing quite so much attention. fits my curvy 17 year old daughter perfectly.  she\\'s has a lovely figure with a small waist and curvy hips but pants don\\'t usually fit both her waist and her hips.  these fit her perfectly and her iphone fits in the pockets. i can\\'t ask for anything else. i got what i wanted. good price, fast, inexpensive shipping. i will definitely do business again. these are fantastic.  made of a nice comfy material. they wash well but air dry.  the waistband is weird and small, but if you wear these at your actual waist and not lower, it may suit you better.  if you plan on wearing it lower, expect the waistband to cut into you. at first i was taken aback with the estimated delivery date quoted over 4 weeks from the day i ordered, but was pleasantly surprized when it arrived much earlier! the sizing is fine, but i did notice the lable (tag) on the garment noted medium as a size 6 (28 euro), not the expected size 8 (euro 29)for a medium...guess the sizing is a bit different in japan. these leggings traveled a far journey to get here, and arrived in a cool little bundle. i am pleased with the purchase and find these leggings of great quality and the price just couldn\\'t be beat! nice color and material. felt comfy and has a second liner inside to help cover up. has no belt so you can really mix and match with any belts or hip scarf .did take a bit longer than expected to arrive but made it in time for halloween! i would defiantly recommend :) so comfortable.  in love the pants fit perfect and they do the work. they help me on and after my work outs. bought this for my wife.  they fit as expected. im now 8 months pregnant and i wear these pants all the time they are so comfy i really like them because unlike maternity pants you can stick the band under your tummy traditional maternity pants make my tummy hot and ichy it\\'s a very good product, easy to pun in and out to train. just be aware that it doesn\\'t hold as much as the regular one (like overnight i need to use the regular size 5) but this is a training pants, so it does its job. wifes xmas gift. well she searches for them every morning so thats gotta say something to how warm and comfy they are my wife loves them! well, i don\\'t know about you, but i have been blessed with a weight loss of 45 lbs. in just as many days, and i badly needed something to hold up my pants until i could order some new (smaller) pants!  what a loverly problem to have! these suspenders are ace quality. number one! the material is well-sewn and not cheap. neither are the clasps. the clasps are smaller than i prefer, but for the price and speed of delivery, i am very happy. get them, if you need to hold up your draws! (or if you just like suspenders). great trainers i love these pants. i bought them in 3 colors. they are comfortable and fit great. buying from amazon.com makes it easy! like it! good look i love these!! they are so comfy and you don\\'t have to pull them up constantly or pull them out lol. i would wear them everyday if i could! i\\'m a 105 lbs asian girl thats just 5 ft and the size small fits me fine. i would have bought an extra small but i guess i can taper the thighs to make it more fitting. these pants are soft and super comfortable. also, what a great price for palazzo pants! so cute up on the stage, the perfect addition to the mermaid costumes our troupe danced in these are just what i was looking for.  there\\'s enough of a flair to the bottom that i can wear them as business casual attire.  they have a nice weight to them.  i\\'ll buy another pair or two, most likely. this is perfect if you need something to cover up at the beach or the pool, and don\\'t want to spend a bundle. great quality at great price soft, good fit, laundered well. i would order again if i need footed pants in the future. very glad they were as described. the soft cotton knit is exactly what i wanted to be comfortable, not the hard kind. fits comfortably and flexible enough to move around in.  grew up playing the game of monopoly lots and lots, and the memories abound! my ex says these are great--she got them and dumped me, so i never got to see them on her. note to self: never deliver gifts straight to gf\\'s. always give in person, so i can take them back if she dumps me. great fit. love these, would recommend perfect transaction!!!  most comfy outfit i own.  i will by more in more colors.  the outfit was exactly as expected. got these for my daughter who is 4\\'10&#34; so these are somewhat long. since it one size thought that is not unusual. so for those that are short expect long pants. they are fitted at the ankles but fit loosely as expected. my teenage daughter loves them by the way. best pj\\'s for casual wear at bedtime. incredibly soft and comfortable for baby it was nice and fast just big around the waist. love how soft they are. love the pants my perception of these pants from previous reviews was that they looked really good and were super comfortable to wear to work. these are comfortable and the length is good (i\\'m 5\\'3&#34;) but they were definitely more like yoga pants than pants for the office. i will still wear them around but maybe not to work. i really like these pants. they are a bit snug, but not to bad. i am about 5\\'6 and the length is perfect. overall happy with the purchase. cons: these are pretty small.<br />they show the bottom of my butt if i move too much.<br />the fabric that covers your crotch is pretty thin.<br /><br />pros: very comfortable<br />good for wearing around the house or under skirts/dresses<br /><br />these are not good for public exorcise or being out in public anyways. (unless you like your butt hanging out)<br />:) these are fantastic exercise leggings. they stay in place, wick moisture away, have a nice mid-rise waist, and are just overall very comfortable. i will be buying more. these are beautifully made trousers. i have a pair of these pants, and they are extremely comfortable.  in fact, i wear them more than any other piece of maternity clothes that i own.  i am 5\\'10\\\\\\\\\" and normally a large in non-maternity clothes.  when i get pregnant, i gain quite a bit of weight and end up extra large, so pea in a pod is not an option for me, otherwise, perhaps i would order their $85 yoga pants.  as an alternative, though, i find these completely fine.  my only complaint is that after several washes, the knit has begun to ball up, but honestly, i\\'m wearing these for comfort, not for fashion points.  so, in summary, if you\\'re wearing these to look like paris hilton going to the gym, they\\'re not for you.  if you just want some comfy pants, these are your cheap alternative.  p.s.  i\\'m ordering another pair right now to alternate with the ones i have.  maybe if i\\'d done this in the first place, the others wouldn\\'t have balled up.  at this price, why not? i\\'m a &#34;traditional woman&#34; or &#34;thick&#34; woman with a few years on her. it\\'s important to me to look youthful but not age myself by looking young. these pants nailed it for me. comfy - i could eat thanksgiving dinner in these and too cute for words. the texture of the moleton feels luxurious so i come away feeling i spent more than i did. in fact i had to add $5 to the cost of these pants in order to send another brand back. i still think these are a deal, if not a steal. sooooo happy i took a chance on these. they are much more than i expected. wallflower is not just for juniors any more! my husband has a pair of these cargos, and they\\'re almost the only pants i ever see him wear, once the temperatures get above 65.  the legs zip off, which isn\\'t clear in the photo, and they make a decent pair of shorts.  i like when he wears them because he can\\'t claim he doesn\\'t have space in his pockets for my things, when i ask him to carry my phone, makeup, sunglasses, and id because i didn\\'t want to carry my purse.    unless he\\'s secretly replacing them when i\\'m not paying attention, they\\'ve seemed to hold up very well. purchased these as a gift. super warm and comfy pants. my son is a slender 180 lbs.and 6\\' 3&#34;, and they are right at fitting perfect, with a little extra room at butt and legs. if you are taller you may want to go up a size, or simply let the hem out and gives you another inch, this is what we do with nike pants and then surge the bottom with a sewing machine. these will be great for winter. cute and fits really well - not see through. love love love love love them they fit great. they make my butt look amazing. the price get out of here!!!!!!! great these are great underwear for a beginner.  they are not diapers.    but they do contain a small mess, so you won\\'t have to clean your carpet with every accident.  you will have to change their clothes.  use when your child is really ready for the potty. they are soft fit well.  these are better than pull ups when your child is ready because many children think nothing of going in a pullup, which feels like a diaper. i love these pj\\'s for home wear for my daughter. the elastic is not too tight and does not leave marks on baby\\'s body. washes and wears well. colors are aesthetically pleasing. the only small issue (not really an issue for me though) was that instead of the gray pj i got a sky blue pj in the pack. the other 2 colors are as indicated. the \\'large\\' size fits my 30\\\\\\\\\" tall and 21 lbs heavy baby perfectly right now. very nice fit these fit amazing!! i recommend them to all my co-workers. have paid literally 4-5xs as much for something not as comfortable & as great a fit than these! i prefer these pants over the thinner version of them...this gear is better for me because i am cold-intolerlant and can be in areas where its chilly.  this pant is very comfortable and is fitting to your form and daily use of them.  i recommend you get a size bigger than you wear and way due to the elastic inside they fit fine and you wear a belt to be more proper anyhow so it works. fit great! nice pjs awesome gym pants i\\'m in the air force and i love to run in the mornings with these sweats but they don\\'t have any pockets!<br />i was disappointed but they are still very comfy and fit great. i never buy items that don\\'t have reviews on amazon, but i bought these pants and i am happy with them. they look exactly like the picture, and are made of comfortable breathable material. i got size s, my measurements are: waist 28inch, hip 38inch. the pants are a little tight on top, but that\\'s how i wanted them and they are not uncomfortable. you can pull them up, high waisted style, or wear them lower on hips. length is below knee (i am 5\\'6&#34; tall) pants were pretty big and too long.  i still need to hem them (i\\'m a super procrastinator).  but i like them very much. how quickly will i be able to get every pair?  these are my favorite leggings yet!  they fit perfectly, great length (important as i\\'m 5\\'10ish), and the print is even nicer than i thought it would be!  i can\\'t wait until my greyjoys arrive!  yay!! love them just got these today (purple & cyan) and saw there were no reviews, so thought i would give my 2 cents.  i first saw these type of pants in israel.  i said no way would that waist stretch enough, but it does! (i am 38 waist, 41 hips and these are comfortable, although i do wear them slightly below the waist only b/c i don\\'t like anything sitting right on my waist, and it does fit if i pull them all the way onto my waist).  i did end up getting a pair in israel (as the shop owner insisted i try them on and i am glad he did), and these are much softer than the israel ones as well as the waist stretches better.  i regretted not getting more while in israel, and was delighted to see these on amazon.  the legs are a little baggy given the style, but the soft material drapes nicely.  however if you like fitted pants these are not for you.  i just now hand washed to test for wrinkles, and there were none.  oh, i also love the fact it has pockets ... not all harem pants do and i cannot live w/out pockets!  i ordered 2 more just now! (one of them being a different pattern on another link of candyhusky\\'s) they were great. my new go to pants for as long as they produce this quality and fast shipping. just filling in this review makes me want to buy more. ok, no time to chat, need to buy more pants. wow!!!!!  what a pair of pants for the price.  they are very comfortable, laundry well, and are very easy to iron!  you cant beat this deal anywhere else!!  if you wear 38w 30s(only size available for the price), this is an unbeatable deal!! i absolutely love these pants!  they came quickly and in great condition.  ive worn them countless times.  i get constant compliments on them and the string can be adjusted to look more like a skirt or more like pants depending on your mood or style.  after 15 or so wearings some of the thread on one part of a seam has come loose, but it is a small quarter sized gap that i hand fixed with no problems.  i would actually buy a second pair myself if i couldn\\'t sew.  can\\'t go wrong with these! these are pretty good. i followed the reviews and went to the next size up. i\\'m not sure i really needed to though. other than that these are great. they have several pockets as well which is what i was looking for i can not say enough about this training seat. it is very hard now a days to find a seat with a deflector. this one is the only one where my son doesn\\'t pee all over the place. great fit! love them so comfy these are really great bdu pants! they fit perfect, and have the adjustment straps on the sides for tightening up if needed. the material is really soft yet durable, with reinforced knees and such. the marpat design is really nice and the matching shirt is just as nice. they are super comfy and i would definitely recommend them! these pants fit great and are very durable.  the extra pockets are great and they have straps to tie around the ankles. this can be found in the orvis catalog but the manufacturer is clothing arts. i\\'ve worn these about 10 times and i am impressed with the quality. there are several pockets that are secured by buttons and zippers, so they are as pick pocket proof as anything out there. the fabric stretches nicely and is so light, comfort is supreme.<br /><br />these are already my favorite casual/travel pants.  i\\'m going to get a second pair for sure. i recieved this pretty quick. i didnt expect it to look exactly like in the pic. i wore this to a party and got great compliments. i love the material and the way it\\'s made. i will definitely be ordering more from this company. got these for my daughter. she likes them and i think the quality is decent. this is amazing...comfortable....and so cute...will order again...the material is sheer and i noticed anything velcro will pull the threads...will probabally rip easily but so light and comfy its worth it...and came 2 weeks earlier than delivery date...love this more than any outfit i have ever owned!!! i love these pants, they are so comfortable that i believe i can wear them year around. hiked in these pants for several hours and they are very comfortable and easy to move in. order one size up for the right fit. it works just fine when used correctly!  it saved me from tossing out good pants.  well worth the low cost. very pretty pants. good quality. good color. fits right. washes well. would buy again. fit great 5\\'4&#34; 128 lbs.  nice and long for long legs and 2&#34; heels.  stylish love these. very cute amazing product. i absolutely love these pants, so soft, so comfortable, and are a great value. these pants are as fun and as wild as they look in the picture.  they got rave reviews from my husband for fit and comfort. i bought this for my handicapped adult daughter who wears diapers.  they are soft and comfortable, but at the same time are waterproof to help prevent getting her clothing and bedding wet.  they are on the expensive side, but to me, they are worth it when i don\\'t have as much laundry to do. i have 2 pair of the pants and the shorts. these are by far the most comfortable and most affordable i\\'ve purchased. wish they came in more colors than just the cream and black. i did not think it was as good quality for the cost however i am very surprised quality is good .. love this i ordered a large i wear 11 or 13 sometimes pits perfect they run kinda true to size.. you might wanna order up a size- i had bought these at a differant store. amazon had a better deal. thats why i went with them. i like them they are soft and as a casual wear i can put a nice shirt on and they look good. of course they are durable too. they are really a dark brown not bad looking too perfect pants son loves and wears them all the time.  light weight and comfortable. sized right for my tall 15 year old. very nice style of pajama. these yoga pants fit very well and i find them to be very comfortable. i ordered an xl, as i am 5\\'7&#34; and about 185. the length is perfect. they are wider legged at the bottom than i thought they would be. i prefer a flared leg, and these are a bit wider. i was concerned about the fold down waistband, but my fears were unfounded, as it stays where i put it. there is no rolling or having it unfold while being worn. i have only worn them one time and have not washed them as of yet. i hope i don\\'t have to come back and make any revisions to my review. worked just great i am 5\\'4&#34; and 110lbs and a small fits me wonderfully. not tight and the pants are perfect legnth. they do not drag floor and cover my shoes a little. the jacket is also perfect. i have washed this about 5 times now and so far so good. the color hasnt faded and the material is still like new. love it! these pettipants are a necessary item during the hot, muggy summer months.  love them. very good pants they fit just right for my 6\\'6&#34; 250lbs frame. i love them so much, i never want to take them off no don\\'t make me augh! these pants are wonderful....with my son at that age of pants not fitting in waste and length too short these pants fit perfectly w/ the draw string elastic waste. color, fit, length exactly as pictured. i\\'m 5\\'6 with longer legs and the pants are the perfect length. with a pair of flats they just barely skim the ground. the material is a little thin and not forgiving at all. i would only wear these with neutral underwear as anything with a pattern or color will show through. pants are perfect. wore them camping and temps got down to 35 degrees. no problem. very warm. great quality. very nice linen pants. perhaps i could have gotten a 10. my waist is 31 inches and some of my clothes theses days are medium, some large. the pant leg does not look like the picture, though. yes, it is the correct length and design, but wider. don\\'t know whether that\\'s a function of being size 12? the waist is nicely made and comfortable, not snug. there is a discreet zipper at the front, but you won\\'t need it since the waist is elastic. üòÅ great fit and fabric, great style i was somewhat skeptical when i ordered these pants, however, i was pleasantly surprised.  the fabric moves with the body.  after laundering, i did not notice any shrinkage or pillage.  these pants are a great buy.  i originally ordered only one pair, then was so pleased i went back and ordered a second pair! i ended up buying additional pairs of these. the fabric is nice and soft and stays that way wash after wash. i\\'ve owned a pair for a few months and they hold up nicely and work well for those of us that are tall great pants! super comfy for everything but yoga, which i haven\\'t tried in them, lol. nice and supportive for cushing\\'s-growing tummies. (in spite of an expansion of 3 sizes, still fit) these yoga pants are comfortable!  i practically live in them. a good pant for us short & maturing girls. love these yoga pants,  i am hand painting them to create one of a kind, custome designed colors. cute and comfy love the fit, quality of fabric, feel, and shape. i\\'m a curvy girl and recently had a baby, and i love the waistband on these pants! they hold me in without giving me muffin top! lol i\\'m 5\\'5&#34;, weigh 251, and i have 53 inch hips and got the xl. it fit snug and comfortably.  they are long and do come to my ankles (unlike the picture). there is a rubber smell but it\\'s no different from any neoprene or &#34;sauna suit&#34; material so it is bearable. it appears to be durable so far and i have big thighs! lol the sweat stays in the pants and not on your skin so that\\'s a plus. i\\'m glad i purchased it and honestly don\\'t have any complaints that would warrent a return. it arrived on time according to my tracking information also. worth the money imo. cool with longer tops.  fits nicely and do indeed deceptively look like jeans. as yoga pants go, these are perfect.  good fit, they are very soft, and they are not too thick or thin. i love these pants.  wear them to go out and always get compliments. perfect fit for me - 5\\'4\\\\\\\\\", 38\\\\\\\\\" hip. i bought these pants for my 12 year old daughter, for her school\\'s dance concert. the pants fit her just right and they\\'re so comfortable! thank you even though this item fit somehow bigger than expected i was still able to use it but definitely if i purchase it again i would select  one size smaller. out of this i still love them i really like these!  the only downside is they are really thin.  don\\'t sit on any concrete or don\\'t do any gymnastics in them lol. perfect for an average day though. makes my booty look bigger! they fit great n look nice i\\'m satisfied i found these pants to be a perfect fit and of a very good quality for the price. excellent value. i love these.  i own three pairs and will be ordering more. i am a size 14-16 and the large fits fine. the only concern is the darker colors (black) wears thin very quickly. i can only wear them around the house, but my purple and blue pairs which i bought at the same time don\\'t have this issue.<br />the material is sooo soft and the waistband isnt annoyingly tight after a few weeks. it is very light weight which i adore cause of where i am at this moment. the price were reasonable and delivery was on time. i would recommend this product to friends and family. 5\\'1&#34; and around 120lbs post baby, bought these to have a boot cut pant while i lose the weight and feel less comfortable in leggings. i will have to cut them for length, but i\\'m so impressed with the overall look and feel of these. nice, thick material, stretchy and comfy, and look great. i bought a size small, and they are awesome. high enough to smooth out the muffin top but long enough in the crotch to avoid giving the dreaded camel toe. i\\'d buy more of these. do any of these pants have pockets? exceptional fit and quality when i walk into the gym people know! they feel the freedom radiating off these pants! these pants give you more respect in a room then chuck norris\\' fiery red beard! had to return pants because they were too big. material is soft and very comfy. fit great!!! i love the length, even at 5\\'7\\\\\\\\\" i hate flooding. they were a bit on the tight side though. i typically wear a small, but i\\'m returning these for a medium. i prefer my workout pants to not be skin tight, but most people probably like that for yoga. excelente the quality is great and the picture design is detailed and exactly what i was hoping for! i am very happy! excellent product performed as described.  i was able to stretch blue jeans that had shrunk about 1 1/2 inch back to normal size.  product could be a little stronger but did do the job .  i would recommend this product to all customers. these pants are fantastic!  i just tried them out  (got them last week).  i wear a size 14/16, short.  the x-large fit perfectly,  and yes, the waist runs smaller, but,  it is not a problem, @ all.  waist is stretchy.  the cords @ the ankle, make it adjustable @ the knee or ankle.  i did some dance steps.  these pants feel great,  i can kick,  i can move anyway possible,  no binding.  in fact, these pants are very cool to wear,  just exactly what a zumba class needs.  and,  i did some yoga and the pants are so comfortable to wear, i just may wear them to yoga class, too.  keep moving! so glad i have these incredibly comfy pants for my pregnancy! my mother-in-law purchased me for these which was very nice because i\\'m not sure if i would have paid that much myself. but now i understand and would definitely purchase more pants on my own. i am currently 28 weeks pregnant and these are more comfortable than a lot of my other maternity pants. i could also very easily see myself wearing these after the baby for a long time. i have the bda pants in black, size xs/sm. my pre-pregnancy size was a 4/6 at 135lbs and i\\'m currently at 160lbs. first use was in weather -10 f (water frozen on bank) but legs were warm. fit great and very comfy would love to see more colors in the medium, great fit and not too thin. very happy with these.<br /><br />for reference, i am 5\\'8 1/2&#34;, 135 pounds and i ordered a medium.  as others mentioned, they are quite long--i\\'m guessing maybe a 33&#34; inseam, probably too long for me to to wear with a flat shoe.  my pair is hemmed, so the makers may have paid attention to the complaints.<br /><br />the black paisley pantsi don\\'t seem sheer at all, but they are probably too clingy to be worn to work, unless you work in a very casual, arty place.<br /><br />the fabric is so silky that your significant other may find it hard to keep his/her hands off. i\\'m a 34-34 or a 34-32 in dress pants. i like having my pants ride on my hips, so a 34 waist, at my waist, can hold a softback novel (held vertically) in front of my belly button, and i can still breath.  when i sit down, the pant legs on the medium, still touch my shoes.. just.  i don\\'t like a 32\\\\\\\\\" length because it would ride up, and you can see my socks.  i got a medium, and they are a perfect fit. i don\\'t even have to pull the tightener straps.  the front pockets have a huge mouth. it runs about 2/3rds the pockets\\' depth. so if you stick your hands in your pockets when your cold, your pinky will be in the pocket, but from that knuckle to your wrist will be outside, but your thumb, and wrist on the thumb-side will be in the pocket.   i like the extra lower pockets.  cons:  i thought they would be softer, or more ... cottony.  they are the thin, hard, rip-stop material you get in bdus. they soften a little over time, and washing, but they will never be like kakis.    overall a good buy. i\\'m going to buy another one in black. as described these are fantastic. they look just like one would expect. they fit as described as well. i would highly recommend! these pants are amazing. they fit like a glove and are great quality. i don\\'t know why you would pay more than 39.99 for some other brand when these are top notch. im looking forward to getting a few more pairs. i\\'m a size 12, 170 lb.s and 5\\'9.  the l is a bit loose.  what i will say is that they do make you sweat!  i also like the high waist. i bought them for my mother and she loves them. great these yoga pants are very comfy and aren\\'t too long. they are figure flattering, however they were a bit thinner than i was hoping for, but overall very satisfied with the purchase. these are great!! they keep my 4 month old nice and toasty in combo with his fleece sleep sack. he is 26 &#34; long and weighs 13lbs 13oz. i ordered the 9-12 month size because we cloth diaper and a lot of reviewers said they run small. i am super glad i ordered them 2 sizes up because otherwise they never would have fit. these are officially my favorite comfy pants thanks these are exactly as shown and the fit is perfect.  they arrived in 2 days and i am very pleased. super comfy and fit well. go with anything. many compliments on these pants, i had never warn them before, but love them. flattering, comfy, great material. everything i want from a pair of yoga pants! i haven\\'t worn it out yet but i tried it on and it fits great!! my wife looks good in leggings so gave these jeggings a try. leopard print is cool, fit is great and they have a \\'jeans\\' design on them that does make them look like skinny jeans from a distance. arrived quickly and the product appears to be very good. i thought i had posted a review, but here is a second one.  these pants are stunning  they fit perfect. (sz med)  i am 5\\' 1&#34; and weigh 145 lbs.  my kids tell me i look taller in these pants.  i say it\\'s just the heel on my shoes, which is about an inch and a half.  my sister-in-law tried them on and they fit her perfectly even though she is a little wider in the hips.  they do not bunch or show any creases.  they are snug but lay flat all the way down your leg.  you have to see and feel the material to appreciate how beautiful these pants really are.  i did not have to hem them.  i just measured the amount i wanted to take off at the bottom and cut them. fits perfect! :) i bought a medium and i\\'m 5\\'7, 150 lb and they fit wonderfully. awesome! they were smaller than i expected, but my daughter didn\\'t have any complaints about them being a bit too small. teenagers. ...i have a feeling i will not be able to wear them for too long, especially if i get any bigger. the jeans are the perfect fit everywhere, except for right below my belly/pelvic area. it gets a little tight when i sit down too long and i have to constantly adjust them by either pulling them up or down. whoever made them could have lowered the stretchy part of the pants so that it would fit everything above the pelvic line. other than that, i can still wear them and they look great! stylish, but not comfortable to wear all day. gorgeous material, great quality but runs extremely small. i\\'m 5\\'3, 130 lbs, i ordered the medium i believe (16) but it was too tiny to get over my hips and i have pretty small hips! disappointed because it\\'s such a beautiful romper, i decided to gift it to a much thinner friend rather than exchange for a bigger size. if your a very thin or petite woman i highly recommend! *order a size up! fits great and looks great. i have a big baby and this brand is so great because it doesn\\'t cut into the buddha belly!  cute design, soft. quality seems like carter\\'s brand equiv. i would definitely recommend & buy these again love these perfect for my hulk hogan costume light weight and compact for storage. purchased for the just in case would recommend to any true viking fan. the fit is true to size (i am a young man 5\\'8&#34; 135 lbs) they are very comfortable, don\\'t ride up and was well. love them. look great and very comfortable i really like these pants and i have order my 2nd pare now. they fit well and keep the cold off the legs when the temperature drops. i am 5\\'11&#34;  185 lbs and the medium fits good. i have used them once for biking and they worked well for biking too. i am not a winter bike rider so that is why they were only used once on my bike. great for running though. this product is absolutely amazing. fits well and is made of great quality. got to me super fast. thanks again!!!!!! these pants are a little \\\\\\\\\"baggy\\\\\\\\\" but they are the perfect length. my little one has supper chubby thighs and a chunky belly, so these are perfect. she out grew old navy pants in the same size because there was no give in them for her thighs. these are perfect for her! great so cute! and well made! i bought these as a gift for a secret santa exchange.  $20 was the maximum price limit, so the typical $25-$35 options were out of the question.  the person i bought the pants for loves them and wears them regularly. super cute leggings! comfortable and perfect fit! my 17 yr old rocks these leggings she gets compliments everytime she wears them! hi guys, i got these and yea they do run a little small, so be aware of that. i really love the design of these they could be dressed up with the right shirt and accessories, or you could just stay casual.  i needed these for both of those occasions casual and dressed up, they are a very distinguished design and that was what i liked about them, not the every day casual pant, i do suggest ordering a size up thou, they didn\\'t shrink after the wash either which i was expecting so i was glad they did not, and everyone was asking where did you get those their so different, i said got them on amazon.  lol.  i was invited to check these out at a discount, for a full and honest review, ladies your gonna like them they are my go to pant, when i am tired of wearing jeans, i can throw on any shirt i own and done :) great product! a bit too hot to wear in the spring/summer. great feel and fit! this belt is very cute, my son loves it, but its pretty big - even at the smallest length, its more of a style accessory than a belt that holds his pants up.  he\\'s a skinny 8 year old and its just a little too big.  its also very wide, and only fits in some of his belt loops.  but, i knew it might be big when i ordered it, and the style is a wide belt, so i\\'m overall happy with it. the product came quickly and will work well for my intended purpose.  they run very large so if in doubt, choose the smaller size.  i\\'ll look like a balloon woman! for the price these jeans are such a great buy! should of bought a few more just as adorable as they look in the product photos. most adorable on my little girl!! they didn\\'t rip i think they\\'re polyester it was what i was looking for cuffs a little tight but overall a good pair of leggings. my mother is usually a 13 but i ordered her an 11 and it fit her perfectly so i recommend getting a size smaller than usual. or maybe it depends on the body idk but my mother loved her new jeans! if you hate it when you step outside and the cold wind cuts you like a nife then these thermals are just for you because these babies keep you warm. you may need thicker ones if you plan on being outside in the cold longer than 15 minutes. i am short and small so these pants were really great all the sizes they offer, the petite is great if you are 5\\'2 or shorter like me because regular scrubs you always have to  role them up and you dont want them dragging on the hospital floor these float nicely like 1/2 inch over my shoes plus they still have a drawstring if you want them higher or lower. i had to get white which i hate wearing white but at least these are not super see-through, they are comfy and have a nice flare at the bottom. and not expensive either, ive paid more for full elastic waist that was too long. bottom line: i bought 2 pairs great pants good material, fits as expected! would buy again. daughter has sensitive skin and material is solander and mix of cotton, very cute! very comfortable will order again not military specs, but pretty close. i would have liked them better if they kept the button fly (these have a bronze coloured steel zipper). the fit is good - not too tight or loose. dual layer fabric on the knees and bottom is nice for added wear and tear protection. very good bdus! üëç these pants are super comfortable and i love them. the length is quite long but being 5\\'9(155lbs idk if that matters), finding pants that are the correct length are hard to come by, so no complaints from me there. i bought the black ones and they are slightly see through if you bend over but you really have to be looking for your underwear to actually see it. i love these pants and i will be buying more! the pants are good for the money spent on them, but i wouldn\\'t buy another pair. the fabric feels weird its not very soft. they are not comfortable to do yoga in, very  scratchy feeling. they are now my daughters and she loves them, so personal preference plays a part in the review. it was as expected n my friend i got it for loves it. was glad i got it for her love these... they are super comfy and feel just like regular underwear. they are thick, soft and very absorbent. i am using these exclusively to potty train my daughter. just wish they made more styles/colors! it\\'s nice will buy again soft & thick & my 2 month old look so cute in it! very good materal and i received before i expected it! you should buy it although it is a some how tight mainly at the thigh region but it is good material and very nice design really i love it. love these comfy, roomy pants.  they look professional and i bought 2 pair this pregnancy after buying a pair with my last baby and getting so much wear out of them.  highly recommend them. i am around 5.2ft. tall and 103 lbs, thin girl, i read that it runs small so i got a small when i\\'m usually a x-small!!! it fits perfectly! and it doesn\\'t feel cheap.  the colors don\\'t look completely the same but that\\'s the only thing, worlth with the price. and it came after only 10days, fast shipping from china! recommend!!!! comfortable, fit well. esactly what expected.arrived quickly. very pleased. it is hard to find men\\'s scrubs out there! i will definitely order from here again. i\\'m 5\\'10&#34; and weigh 115lbs. i received this and was disappointed because the torso length was too small. so i took my sewing machine out! i\\'ll be ordering a medium next time! so pretty!!! vibrant colors! great fit these are nice for the price and have the &#34;real jeans&#34; look. they go great with wintery shirts, sweaters and hoodies when you want to be warm but not bulky. these pants are amazing so comfy decent pants for the price.  i buy several of these for the season for much less than the name brands and the ability to adjust the hem is great.  last one season and wear out with all the sliding at the knees. i don\\'t think a more expensive brand would do much better. these pants are better than expected. they are cut small, i wear a size 10, and a xlg. fits me a little loose, but not by much. the material is heavy duty canvass. these pants will last for a long, long time. well worth the money. glad i got them. great i am wearing these as i type. they are the one out of three misses\\' size sweats, all different brands, which i will keep. i am average height and build, these are cut for me. the weight of the fabric is nice for these cool, rainy nights. and there are pockets, and actual elastic in the waistband. i\\'m a fan! i\\'ll order two more of these to replace the returns. great fit all around‚Ä¶use for casual or with a tie and jacket very comfortable pants, and the fabric is amazing .<br />i wear it everyday and everywhere, it is so useful.<br />more than i was expecting. nice quality and good fabric...like the style also. i\\'m 5\\'2 and average build so they are a little big and long.  i wish a petite length was available! i am 5\\'9&#34;, 200 lb, athletic build.  i ordered a size &#34;large&#34; and they are a perfect fit for pajama pants.  the force is strong with these pants. very happy. apart from me loving the big bang theory, i love these pajama pant... however, these pajama pants do not have pockets. my daughter and wife loves these.  fits well and material is comfortable. cool work out pants thank you i stand out when i work out makes me feel like a pro but i am not o well. good pants love it! love them and came in perfect timing legs are baggie but the rest of the fit is comfortable love how this jeans fit! so beautiful. fits very well. will buy again great product fast shipping. super stretchy, super comfortable. i wore these for a dance recital. they move well with your body. they feel like softer tights, but are a little thicker. i am fairly certain you need shorts or something over them because they are slightly see-through. i still recommend them because they are soooo comfy and move wonderfully. love these pants. i bought every color.<br />i just want to wear them everyday. so comfortable. they go from yoga to all day activities. at last! yoga pants for those of us taller than the average woman! i am 5\\'10&#34; and ordered the mediums - i have a few inches still left for length. the material is a little on the thin side, but not see-through at all (i ordered black). they are extremely comfortable and make my body look amazing. i am going to get them slightly hemmed to fit my length better, but i am so thankful to finally find yoga pants that fit me! i will be back for more!! a little to long i\\'m 5\\'3 ordered the extra large size. washed in cold water on gentle cycle. dried on low heat. great product, nice soft material, labeled as rayon, color did not run. great for summer renaissance fairs, would need another layer for colder weather. seemed true to size. hawaiian ocean color a bit bright but still nice. i have been wearing a pair of these pants for a few years now.  i always wear them when i travel by air.  they are comfortable, easy up and down in the bathroom, and work in all types of weather.  especially wear them when traveling from nj to fl almost all seasons...just put on a t-shirt and light sweater, sneakers or sandals and ready to go.  in the below 30 degree temps we are having right now, i even wore them to the grocery store with a pair of uggs, long-sleeved polo and pea coat.  was very comfortable.  do wish they came in additional colors, too. these fit perfectly and long enough for us tall girls! i got my pants fairly fast. the pants were superb. they are bright and fit well. they also have string attached to the waist to help keep them tight on the waist line. i rate them 4 stars due to the suspenders. for someone who is 6 ft tall, the suspenders are too small and the chain will be to tight on the sholders. there is no option to adjust them. i highly recommend buying a pair of suspenders and replace the one that it comes with. other then that, i am pretty satisfied with the purchase. the pants fit well, i order them for a zumba competition and they work great. i had no problem with the waist. i\\'m 5\\'5 and 135 so i got a medium glad i did. exactly as expected in every way. little smaller than what i thought but it\\'s still fine. it was exactly as shown.  i\\'m happy with this item and would most likely buy another in a different color. when i first put these pants on they felt comfy, but as the day went, i kept having to pull them up repeatedly, don\\'t hold their shape like victoria secret yoga pants, but you get what you pay for. the multicam is the right paturn, and the stiching is pretty good. now remember this is not 511 or proper brand bdu, but seems to be made well enough to hold up for airsoft or paintball. i think you get what you pay for and more. perfect!! i like the abundance of colors too from this company.  price is awesome. i am in love with these!!!! they are a little long for my 5\\'6 stature. but they fit is good. i wear a 24 womens and the 24 of these fit great. will probably order more soon. these do not look like frumpy maternity pants, they are awesome! they look really sharp and nice, good with flats and heals, probably heals for me because i am short and they are too long for flats on me. they are so comfortable too. i would get them in another color i like them so much. so comfortable!!! i am in heaven when i put these on. great quality fabric. great buy! the website said they fit small, however, i wear a 4 and purchased a medium and they were very big.  i ended up sending them back and got a small and they have been great so far. these pants are very comfy for my little one to roam around in.  they are lightweight and very roomy in the legs.  also a very nice price for how much use i\\'ve gotten out of them so far. great pant these hot pants are exactly what i ordered.  they go well under many skirts that i wear.  i would recommend this product. i\\'m buying another pair!  love the material! a little big but she has grown into them. i like the quality of cotton. great price and easy shopping good to wear under dresses and skirts purchased these for grandson! they are so soft. they wash very well. will be purchasing more soon. seem to be very comfortable they\\'re very silky. perfect for the summer. they are cut long though. i don\\'t mind because i only wear them around the house but if your 5\\'3 like me and want to wear them out.. iunless you don\\'t mind hemming or walking on them it might be difficult i bought these for my son (who is 4) to wear for the first few days of preschool, as he sometimes has accidents when over-stimulated or excited. i noticed he came home with dry pants every day. the underwear are nice and thick, but not too thick as a diaper, but also not as absorbent as say, a blueberry pull-up underwear. good for the price though. i would recommend them for sure. experienced some issue with the infant pants and maple clothing company reached out to me to resolve the issue.  excellent customer service. would purchase from again. i\\'m not quite as sexy as the model in the picture, but these still look really nice. just looks like you\\'re wearing skin tight jeans. only downside is mine already had two runs in the fabric, one on the left thigh and one right on the buttcrack. not terribly noticeable, but there you go. the quality is great but they are really sized small. ordered medium but could not begin to get them on.  since i like the  quality i will send them (2 pr) to my skinny daughters! am hoping a large will fit me. second national product that i bought and certainly will not be the last.  the quality is superb and the price is very reasonable.  very happy with this. i love the way they fit and the feel of the material.  i think my legs look great in them & so in return i feel great. great quality, fit well and comfortable. exactly as seen in the pic.vpants have a lot of swishy movement when walking; a great skirt replacement. loved the color a decor, it\\'s very soft and true to size. only thing i did not get are those puckets on pants, we don\\'t use them and stitching on them started to come loose after couple of washes.  other then that its very good value. love, love these yoga pants.  they fit perfectly and aren\\'t thin.  they are perfect for walking, going to the gym, yoga and pilates.  they are slimming, but not too tight for class. these are a great pair of capris! i wear them all the time! i\\'m 5\\'9 bout 170 and ordered the xl.=although i love the pants, they are a bit long. these maternity pants are just fantastic.  the fit is very accurate based on the motherhood maternity sizing chart, and the pants fit me perfectly.  the secret fit belly keeps the pants up very well and is comfortable.  my belly tends to get a bit itchy after wearing the pants all day, but i also have sensitive skin.    i ordered these pants in heather brown and black.  as far as i know, the fabric is the same for both, but the black pants seem to collect every piece of lint in a 5-mile radius, whereas i haven\\'t noticed that problem with the heather brown.  also, it is important to follow the washing and drying instructions.  the pants need to be washed on a gentle cycle and air dried.  if you don\\'t do this, the faux, slit pockets will pucker out funny.  (my husband was doing the laundry and didn\\'t read the instruction label.  :p)    all that aside, i would still strongly recommend these pants.  very high quality! i was worried that these would be see-thru but not at all. i can move around in them without any restriction and they fit great. i bought a size l and i vary between size 10-12. i probably will buy a few more colors to wear alone or under skirts. do take care to wash inside-out and hang dry (not in sun-light). if they are in pretty cold or hot temperatures then it is good to put some vinyl oil  or safflower/olive oil lightly on them before storing (best not to fold vinyl clothing). love this piece!!! it\\'s baggy but it does not over power ur body...comfortable for a late stroll on the beach or to a relaxing cookout w/ the family or to relax around the house!!!  i will be purchasing other colors for vacations.  definite fashion staple!!! it fits well and it is as the vendor described, a capri. i am 5 ft \\'tall\\' and initially i ordered a large thanks to my oversized hips and the large was way up to my ankles and lose around my waist. so i ordered a medium and now it fits well.  i wear it to exercise and it doesn\\'t feel uncomfortable rather helps me sweat even further than my usual.  i have not seen a reduction in my waistline nor my hips but i do hope in about 6 months, it will eventually tone out. like what others have said, the skulls are upside down. but it almost looks better that way. i rated it 4 out of 5 because they are see through, but i was somewhat expecting that considering most leggings are. and because they\\'re kinda tight around the calf area, which was weird because my legs aren\\'t fat and i\\'ve never had that problem with pants/leggings before, but once i got them on they fit well and look awesome. so comfortable! washes well. these are very comfortable and cozy!! they came very early, earlier than they were supposed to come, and they are super duper soft!! they don\\'t feel too tight and gives good figure too! i recommend these pants. dumies there made for high top shoes, thats why there short, there not leather because it would be like more like 250$ for these pants, and it doesnt fit if you dont have slim legs like the model......get some knowledge.... these running pants are really a good buy.  the fit great, are extremely comfortable and durable.  my boyfriend loves them. love these beanies.  i bought the 0-12 month sizes in light blue and dark brown.  they are so stinkin\\' cute and my son lives them too.  he\\'s almost 4 months d with a 70th percentile head and the caps fit perfectly.  the stretch so beautifully.  they seem to be able to fit him months from now, as well.<br /><br />when reading about the product prior to purchasing, i don\\'t recall any mention that the material is bamboo but it is.  for those of you who haven\\'t felt bamboo material yet, please trust me when i tell you that it is the softest, coziest material on the planet.  recently, my mom ordered on amazon a bamboo swaddling blanket for my son made by beba bean.  super cozy. they fit nicely and are super comfortable! love these great price! these pajama bottoms are perfect. not too heavy, not too light but just right. i have very sensitive skin and i have absolutely no issues with them i wear a 36&#34; waist pants and these britches fit perfect with a bit of room to spare. the leg narrows nicely at the bottom for sliding inside boots. they are lightweight which was a good feature for a pirate that wears many layers of piratical garb. ye-arrgh! perfect for kids on the move she is 5\\'6, 125 lbs and these fit perfectly. the length is just right, but she is a little tall. the pants were true to size and very comfortable.  the drawstring on the pant leg keeps the pant leg up while dancing.  others, the leg slides back down in the middle of a dance. super comfortable and my soldier loved them! fit nice and arrived quickly these pants don\\'t have pockets! love these pants. got them the day they were expected to deliver. a little bigger then i expected. but other then that i love them! love these pants.  fabric and fit are just what i expected.  only thing is they\\'re too long, but i expected that since i\\'m only a little over 5 ft!  very comfy!  i bought 3 pair, all different colors. love them great training pants for the price<br />fit well and are absorbant to some degree good very comfortable. the quality of item is good, but the sizes are bigger. i ordered size l for myself but it it was like xl..anyway, it was ok for my dad:-) i love these pants! they\\'re super comfy and i always get comments on how unique and fun they are. :d beautifull had read that these ran small so i got an extra large but they\\'re really big on me. they are adorable though and i\\'m still going to wear them anyway, i\\'m hoping they shrink in the wash. probably going to order another pair in large! great price and product! these are fairly thin, but they fit well and are great for winter under dresses or tunics. they fit as expected. i tend to like pants a little bigger so i ordered a size medium. i usually wear them causal with flip flops but also you can dress them up with heels and a sexy top. i\\'m trying to ordering them in white. they don\\'t carry the white on amazon but they do on the company website. i highly recommend these lounge pants. the photo is dead on for what they look like in color ect... the cloth is soft & giving, & sizing seems to be right on the mark to. the person i have these to absolutely loves them, a huge hit!! these are virtually the same as any military issue clothing would be. same buttons, stitching, materials and other construction are as good as any military issued clothing i got while serving. the fit (large/long) is exactly like the l/l i used to be issued. i wear a 34&#34; waist and without the cinch straps pulled tight they do fit loose, but that\\'s how it\\'s designed. without a belt on i can draw up the cinch straps and the waist fits me perfect. button fly, button side and back pockets, good reinforced stitching, blousing straps on the cuffs of the legs, cinch straps on the waist line. the colors are great too! they don\\'t look quite as &#34;subdued&#34; as the picture dictates, the colors look full and the design is sharp, just what i was hoping for. rothco is for sure a brand you should consider if you\\'re looking for a product that is as close to military issue as you can get. this is the real deal! they fit well but are just a couple of inches too long for me, which is surprising as i\\'m fairly tall. good these are great fit. love these pants.  i normally would use a medium but the small was better in these.  wear them every night to bed and, yes, they do help with the loose skin while losing weight. i ordered a size three since i read someone say they ran small and there not necessarily too big but they\\'re a little loose. they definitely don\\'t look as good as the picture and feel kinda weird but overall i like them and think they\\'re great for their price. best invention ever! just wish they were thicker material this is my fvorite belt!! it fits amazingly and i received so many compliments. fast shipment and great product!! this outfit is really cute. the only reason i didn\\'t  give it 5 stars is because the shirt is quite thin (almost see-through) and not very stretchy. i found these while looking for training pants for my 2-1/2 year old daughter who wears a size 4t (i couldn\\'t find size 4t training pants in any store).  they are great!  i specifically want to comment on the sizes and how some reviewers are saying the sizes run big.  yes, the sizes do run big but if you read the back of the potty patty packaging it will read that they run big so your child can pull them off and on by themselves.  we have only had the training pants for about a week but they are good quality and they fit my daughter well with room to grow.  she has had a few accidents in them and no, they don\\'t contain the whole accident but they are not supposed to, you want your kids to feel wet and uncomfortable.  i hope this review helps someone looking for good training pants. i bought these for a baby present. the new mom has been thrilled with them. they are so soft and stretchable.  her baby has very sensitive skin, but she has had no problems with the pants or with the little onsie i also purchased. in fact, she has purchased more to fit her baby as she grows. got 3t for my 2.5 year old; 31 pounds it fits.   the only downside is that it\\'s so puffy very long, i know on purpose but even for that a little too long. gets a little fuzzy after a short while but all in all nice pants. very comfortable and airy feeling. love these i\\'m an 8 and  a medium fit perfectly so soft and comfy ... more will be ordered by me they fit very well, and are very comfortable but stylish. they didn\\'t take to long to get here either. thank you love. wearing them now! i love them! received the pants fast! they were a great price and fit great. these are a great purchase! they are extra long, which is great if you are tall. i\\'m 5\\'8&#34;, 155 (typically a size 8) and the large fit perfectly. excellent for lounge pants or yoga. i will definitely buy another pair! the product is very nice and it arrived much earlier than expected. being short and curvy i have a hard time finding pants that fit. these fit right out of the bag. they look good and they\\'re comfortable. the \\'secret belly\\' material is nice and thin, but keeps the pants up very well. i\\'m at 26 weeks and my baby will not tolerate any under belly waistband, he literally kicks at them. i have some other over the belly maternity pants and the belly coverage is a little bulky and i find myself pulling them up all day, not with these! these are much better and i want to buy more from motherhood maternity! i really like the fit.  i got a size small. i\\'m 5\\'4 about 170 lbs (wear size 10) (i have huge thighs and hippy, with small mid section).  i was sweating just using it doing work around the house. very comfy! wash and wear well. loooose fit and very comfy:-) bought for the husband. nice and soft, not too hot. very good made a little big these are great, if you have butt and hips these are perfect, regular zumba pants are very low rise and dont\\' fit if you have a butt or hips. these are great, what i did was put ribbons on the legs just like zumba pants and they look fab, yes the legs are big but they are not clown pants and they breathe when working out. bought for my grandson but he won\\'t be here until nov. 2014 so can\\'t really give a review on the fit. well made and can\\'t wait for grand child to wear bought for my daughter for halloween she loved it, very comfy and well made but really does need a belt or a extra something like the picture has to make it perfect. first of all i want to say that this company has great customer service and the quality of the product is just amazing. nowhere else in us you can find such warm and baby friendly items. thanks! i have this product and it works great.  it saved me from having to purchase new jeans.  i am slim through the hips and thighs and find that jeans that fit in the hips are too tight in the waist, leading to the dreaded \\\\\\\\\"muffin top\\\\\\\\\".  i don\\'t use the waistband stretcher when the jeans are wet from the wash.  i dry them in the dryer, then lightly dampen them with a spray bottle before inserting the stretcher.  i find that they dry and stretch to the right size in a few hours. i had been looking for a pair of these forever. luckily, i read the other reviews before ordering and instead of getting my normal size of medium ordered the xl and perfect! have gotten compliments and inquiries from other women as to where to find. cute! thin fabric. i have a big butt, so i always have problems with jeans in that area. but they\\'re cute none the less, nothing a long under shirt can\\'t hide :) im 5\\'4 155. these pants are awesome! i ordered an 11 and could have fit into a 9. they are soft and comfortable but professional looking. i have to wear black dress pants to work and these were perfect. small pockets but i dont really carry anything in my pants pockets at work. these pants are tight fitting and slightly flaired at the bottom. they have some give to them. have not washed them yet but i\\'m confident they will hold up well. on time delivery look and feel good on him. larger than i thought, but it\\'s ok, i still love it. and the pocket inside are better than i thought glad i found these there are hard to get in my size my son loves these.  wears them all the time to bed.  very soft and comfy and was up nicely too the models are very modern and beautiful with good workmanship and good quality fabric. the pants fit as expected - they are definitely tight leggings, but i don\\'t have a problem with them being really see-through. i\\'m 5\\'9&#34;, 150lbs, and usually wear a size 8, so the m/l fit fine on me. i\\'m excited to wear them to the world cup this summer! great pants good thickness and the words and emblem are as expected. they are mens sizes so they run a little large if you are trying to fit these to a girl. i\\'m ordering a second pair. i\\'m quite tall (5\\'8 size 6us) so i was worried that it would be too small, but it actually is long enough!<br />the shipping was fast(only 10 days)!<br />i\\'m more than happy i got those legging (especially for such a low price) :) super cute i woud recommend these yoga pants. great snug fit but not to snug. i am 5\\'11&#34; and need to order tall sizes. this hits my sneakers at the perfect length. comfortable material and good quality. i am going to buy one more pair. nice product for the money these pants are awesome! i read the other reviews that said they were too short but since i\\'m 5\\'1&#34; i figured they\\'d be fine, and i was right! i wore these to see sts9 and i love hooping in them love them! great quality! fit very very comfy! i had never owned or even worn a pair of yoga pants before but these may have converted me! so soft, yet breathable. gives the illusion that i have a butt (and a nice one too!) the waist band is weird but worth getting used to. :) satisfied with my purchase. cute shirt for dad to wear to 5 year olds spongebob party! runs large but nothing a wash in warm water and dry on high couldn\\'t fix! would recommend first thing i have to say .... when i ordered this item, it indicated i was going to receive it the 1st of dec, instead i got it on 11/26 and i purchased it the friday before. loved how quick i got it. i tried it on when i got home and &#34;wallah&#34;... love it x 2!!! fits me perfectly... i\\'m thinking of getting me another one in case this falls apart due to wear and tear. can\\'t wait to rock it like a rockstar!!! i purchased these for my husband to wear as an overpant during cold weather while riding his motorcycle.  he says they keep him warm and dry.  he had rather have them in boot cut so that he could just slide them over his boots, but they are somewhat difficult to do. pants are adorable.  colors are bright and quite attractive.  i have gotten many complements on them.  love them. great tactical pants. i\\'ll buy more. comfortable as can be and still looks like jeans! i\\'ve purchased several pair for myself and for my daughter. great product! very cute but would def wear with tunic or longer shirt. they\\'re a little thin but fit is spot on! overall at this price would buy again. i love these pants. own them in all 4 colors! nice fabric for the price.  fit me well (5\\'6&#34;, 130 lb). these baby pants are very cute and the colors are very pretty.  with a crawling baby, it\\'s nice to have some pants without the feet built in! these are very fitted since they do not have flame retardent on them. when they first came in the mail i thought there was no way they would fit my little one, but they fit perfectly! super soft, and very comfy. the one negative i will say is that the pants are a bit see thru, which is strange. i have some friends that use these for dancing and general wear, got myself a pair of them large (which fit perfectly) and i couldn\\'t be happier. love love love this brand! super soft. doesn\\'t shrink. just adorable! i received my high waist leggings and they are amazing they fit perfect and i cant wait to go out in them:)very satisfied !!!!!!! these fit so good and are so comfortable.  i loved the black so much that i ordered the blue too. at 8 months the size i would wear prepregnancy fits well, good length too (i\\'m tall), i know they will be great after pregnancy too. i absolutely adore these pants!! i have fairly wide hips and thick thighs, bought a medium in different colors and they fit wonderfully - not too tight (which is what i have to watch out for) or too loose, just perfect. it\\'s excellent quality and i\\'ll keep buying more pairs from them! i recommend this product! the dockers \\\\\\\\\"individual fit\\\\\\\\\" system works well, in that one can get by without \\\\\\\\\"odd\\\\\\\\\" waist sizes like 33, 35, etc. by ordering even sizes and allowing the system to stretch a bit if it needs to. these pants are very durable, and still look presentable after washing and machine drying. an ironing every so often would probably be useful for \\\\\\\\\"business casual\\\\\\\\\". a good value. nice.  love it.  will purchase again. they hold liquid well, and turkey work over night to help bed dry. however, if child poops in them, it\\'s a terrible mess. does not clean well. do like that it has the snaps on the side. very helpful. would recommend, but wouldn\\'t depend on them regularly everyday. great product for my mother. my daughter loves them these are great jeans.  i highly recommend them.  i\\'ve worn them all the time for the last 2 and a half years and they still look great.  i want to order another pair, but they are on backorder for the next 2 and a half months.  i guess that i\\'ll have to wait! i bought them for my wife and she loves them.  she loved them so much that we bought a second pair. i have been anxiously waiting for these to become available again in black, but so far, no luck. i wish i had bought more at the time bcuz now they aren\\'t available. i love these!!!!! i was nervous about the fit. but even high waisted they fit like a charm! a little bunching at the bottom, but that\\'s ok these pants are great. very comfortable. but they were a it short on me since i\\'m tall. at my school you arnt aloud to wear leggings unless they have belt loops and these are great! i love these. they are so comfortable and flattering! great quality pants.  i was just looking for decent cargo pants.  i was not familiar with the tru-spec brand when i purchased these but i\\'m a fan now. i love the quality, look and feel of these pants.  they look good enough to be worn in my office but durable enough to be used working around the yard as well.  great stitching and reinforced at the knees and the crotch area.  deep pockets and deep cargo pockets too.  these pants have gone through several washings and worn at regularly.  there has been no sign of wear or fade anywhere.  highly recommended. these pants are very soft and nice. will keep my granddaughter warm and very pretty i bought a pair of the woolrich 44447 elite lightweight operator pants about 2 years ago while searching for cargo pants with maximum pockets and pockets that are deep in order to keep things where i put them, and not have them fall out in the car or wherever they should happen to fall out.  after two years, they still take the abuse.  they have suffered a little fading in the knees, but these pants are so comfortable and fit the parameters of what i wanted so well that i would literally wash them nightly so i could wear them everyday.  the fabric is unbelievably durable.  mine only met their end because i caught one of the rear butt pockets on a welding cart and ripped a 3 inch hole in them.  it was almost enough to make a grown man cry loosing a pair of pants that have lasted that long and served that well.  when compared to other brands, woolrich blows the competition out of the water.  you\\'ll never want any other cargos.  the only downside i could see is that they are $60 each, but you can rest assured you\\'ll get at least a few years out of them even with excessive wear.  a definite buy. after pulling my hair out reading tons of reviews on different training pants, i bought a three pack of these for my 10 year old son with autism. i also ordered waterproof covers, but these arrived first. today he\\'s gone through all three, but only one soaked through to his shorts. he drinks water almost constantly, so for these to hold his pee is pretty impressive in my opinion. for a child this age, these are only going to hold one pee - but there was no dripping! my son is a very small 50 lbs with thin legs and i bought the size large. the only reason i didn\\'t give them 5 stars is because they shrunk quite a bit more than expected in the wash. they did fit, but were a little snug, especially the waistband. they fit perfect around the legs though. i just ordered another 12 pack in the xl. these are much cheaper than imse vimse and a lot of other brands, and are thick but slim fitting. my search is over :) i get compliments on these pants all the time! soooooo comfortable and cute! i can dress them up or down- great buy! fits well! i have been wearing these for 3 years and counting. i love the tight fit and the wet look. fantastic product. don\\'t be afraid to wash and dry. i ordered these pants a while ago and even though the wait was very long because i experience little difficulties i am 100% satisfied with the product. it has to be one of the most comfortable pants i ever bought.they fit perfectly the way it says it should and i am overly happy with my purchase.<br /><br />thank you for making buying online possible and so easy!<br /><br />marie .....watch it bring it to your.....sha, na, na, na, na, knees, knees!!!!<br />as if these hideous monstrosities weren\\'t bad enough back in \\'86.<br />it would appear that my beloved/reviled zubaz have made an impossible comback.<br />well....they are comfy. &lt;gulp><br />they\\'re big, they\\'re ugly, they\\'re zubaz.<br />you better own a pair or every hair band from the 80\\'s is gonna get you!!!<br />not recommended unless you\\'re dressing up like dee snider for halloween.<br />and if you don\\'t know who dee snider is....<br />how can you possibly know what zubaz are either??? my 10-year old is very picky about pajamas, and he found these pants very comfortable.  they are not the softest flannel in the world, but they feel nice and look good.  i have not yet washed them, so i can\\'t comment on the durability. if your looking for bright, unique minion pajamas for adults these are perfect. love, love, love these. just what i was looking for these are so comfortable and so cute--i get compliments every time i wear them!  the material is very soft, but i think they would be better described as fleece leggings rather than fleece-lined.  the only downside is that they are not full length on me (i\\'m about 5\\'6\\\\\\\\\" for reference).  i only wear them with high socks and boots because i feel like the length would look silly otherwise. comfy and nice material.  fit is accurate. i have to give this a four because the person i got them for loved them, even if i find them absolutely ridiculous. they are starchy feeling--kind of scratchy--even after washing. but they\\'re really there as a novelty item rather than comfort, i\\'d imagine. they look like something out of a bad 90s music video--but they\\'re pretty funny. it had a hole in the crotch part and a hole in the side pocket nice pants, fits perfect, good quality...........great price........... nice fit and look.  good fabric too. have you tried to find cotton training pants in the stores lately? i did for my grandson. all you find are pullups which take the moisture away from the child. how can they learn not to wet their pants if they don\\'t feel wet?<br /><br />these pants fit perfectly for the size listed. the price was great (i really searched for the best price). getting six pair of pants was awesome! the shipping was fast too. now for the hard part -- potty training! good waist fit, but s tad long. then again i\\'m 5\\'8&#34; on a good day. but not super long. good pants nice pants good quality and every thing i really did not like the shade of the green. i thought it would be like an olive drab darkish green but its not. it\\'s hard for me to describe which green it is, so here goes. if any one reading this is as old as me then i remember when i was a kid i played with the little green plastic army men, if you remember that, then thats the green these pants are, do a google search \\\\\\\\\"green army plactic men\\\\\\\\\" i would get another black hawk but not the green though.<br /><br />thanks for reading. fits true. dries quickly. very comfortable. the price and performance makes this a good value. i have used cotton spandex ones which do not perform as well. i love !!! i am a brit living in the us.<br />i have several of these pants, some for 20 years. bought in the uk. they are indestructable.<br />have used for running and heavy duty mountain biking etc.<br />they wash and dry quickly and safe on the \\'hill\\' when weather turns bad. quick drying.<br />no brainer at the price.<br />if you do any sport outside, you need some of these. see thru, but cute for the price these pants are a yes. they are a little small after the first wash, but i think that\\'s just because of my, ahem, assets. they still fit well, and they\\'re plenty comfortable. heads up, though, they show everything. long shirt of jacket fixes the problem, no biggie. these run small. leg length made for rolling up if desired. hence 4, not 6 stars.<br /><br />these are  very lovely and well-made. but buy larger than you imagine. this style is made to be a little loose, and the size runs a bit small around waist and hips.  i\\'m buying another in a larger size. the chain was cheaply attacked the the clips. but if they snap off just attach a key ring holder at each end and it is better and more secure than ever before! purchased these for my 2-yr. old twins\\' &#34;sesame street&#34; birthday party!  not only did they look freaking adorable, but the quality is fantastic.  true to size - pants may be a tad bit long (that\\'s a good thing).  i have washed several times now and they haven\\'t faded at all.  thick sweatshirt material - very impressed! i really love these pants. they fit well, and stay wrinkle free. they wash and dry with no problems and do not stretch out as you wear them. maternity pants are ugly by nature.  these run small.  i am a standard 12-14 and i needed and x-l.  luckily i can cover the gathers at the back.  the material is thin and shows panty lines.  back faux pockets poorly executed.  normally i shop the republic of banana, and the big g as been a savior for maternity wear. but theses do come long which is what i need, and are economical for 3 months of wear good material these underwear have been a lifesaver for my now 3 yr old!  he loves the softness and i love the durability.  they do stretch some after he has them on for a few hrs., but wash after wash, they are super soft!!! love it my dads a retired vet for usmc and i got him these for christmas very simple, but my son loves it. the cotton is really soft and extremely comfortable! you can use it for many occasions, sports, playing, sleeping etc i luv them!!!!! they fit perfect and complement my shape perfectly.... good awesome! good product. i underestimated the size. not the seller\\'s fault. xl may not fit everyone a size 14 and up. i\\'m size 14 and my leg couldn\\'t go through. turned out to be an excellent gift for my sister to wear under her wedding dress. getting hard to find and would be nice to see them without the elastic cuff... bought 3 pairs, 2 (red/black and charcoal) are just fine but the 3rd (gray/black) came with a rip in it. i\\'ll be returning the one pair but keeping the other 2. pretty satisfied overall! nice quality, but i ordered a large and it fits like a small! i love these pants!  they fit great, look good even after being washed, and are made of a material that can be worn in winter or summer.  i wish they came in more colors! fit very well.  i like the quality of the material.  substantial and form fitting without being see through like lesser price leggings.  color has held up well through several washings. i\\'m pregnant and jeans are too restrictive so i ordered these. i\\'m as big as a house right now but these make me look more slender. i\\'m 6ft tall and the length is perfect. i just ordered my 3rd pair. i wish they were cheaper but then i would probably live in them and wearing yoga pants every day is a fashion no no. leggings were just a tad bit more transparent than i was expecting it would, and it actually has a more brownish-gold vs. gold gold as i see from my computer on the site. but otherwise the spandex part of it works and fits me fine! thanks for quicker than expected shipping as well! came in a week before i planned of it coming in. i was very happy to come across these yoga pants. i\\'m 5\\'9\\\\\\\\\" and wear a leg/x-lrg when it comes to pants. i ordered a large and was hesitant to even bother when i took them out of the package. they looked really small. but, they fit just fine! they don\\'t loosen up, they stay fitted and nice even through a vigorous workout. the crop hits mid calf and the ruched waist band isn\\'t low rise and fits snugly above my hips. would order more if there were different colors! if you looking for a colorful pala<br />zzo pant this is the one. don\\'t hesitate to get it. material, color, and size are perfect for me my 5&#34;10 and i bought the large. they fit great but i will say that they look and feel like a medium size!! great pants though :) really nice, bottom seam a bit tighter than expected but lovely fabric i really do love these pants and they fit nice except the length. im 5\\'1&#34; and they are very long on me. i\\'d definitely recommend these pants to any one who loves harry potter and is a fan like me but for those of short stature like me be prepared to hem the pants at least 8 inches i got an xxl because of the reviews and i am 185 and 5\\'7 and i am usually a large to x large anyways. i really love how these enhanced my bum it did not look wrinkly or anything which it normally does i might add these make my thighs look so smooth and my bum i ordered another pair in white and will order more. my only complaint is they are a bit thick not as thick as jeans but i am so used to wearing regular leggings because i hate jeans that this was a bit different but its worth it when you are going somewhere special or out or whatever they make me look a lot thinner. this is just beautiful and very well made. my daughter teaches belly dancing and her students has a blast putting on all of the belly dancing items. they took photos and all with this pair of harem pants, the tops that i also bought and the jewelry. it is so much cheaper here then in an outlet store , if you could find them. thank you so much for the great service. i was very happy with all of your items i purchased. comfortable and cute. very comfortable and fits perfectüòÜ i can\\'t get enough of these! they are incredibly soft, with the prefect amount of stretch. i\\'ve read some reviews of this brand coming apart at the seams after a wash, but i have not experienced that. we love this brand!! fits just as expected, looks just like the picture. i love it and am going to use it as my new work out pants a bit tight in the leg, would have preferred  a little looser, great material, perfect length for petite. zubaz are well made, soft and comfortable. perfect for relaxing around the house or a trip to the gym. they are well worth the money. i wear these tights for playing roller derby. they are fun and a perfect fit. (i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; & 115lbs in a size small) i order the size large. fits perfect but i thought it was a capri pants. the ones i got is up to my ankle. but i love the high on the waist it goes to my torso. which it covers all the way up my torso. (love it) but wish they were capris.  also the material is excelent. thanks reccomended 100% i have been using the caruso molecular steam hairsetters for several years,  i absolutely love the product, kudos these are fun and great for everything! i\\'m very happy with them. i got them two days early, and i haven\\'t taken them off they fit when you first put them on. after a while they are way loose rothco makes some pretty nice bdu pants. they fit well and are well constructed. they came within 5 business days to the door. when not at work, i live in yoga pants. these pants may be my new favorites. they are comfortable and warm. i love the way they feel. my wife is 4\\'11&#34; and the small was a little bit too long. nothing scissors can\\'t fix! (three more words) adorable! love these pants! great i bought these for burning man and other regional events. i was expecting a really lightweight (cheap) material but was pleasantly surprised! these are a sturdy, denim-like fabric but not too heavy. i have a 33 inch waist and a 34 inch inseam and the medium size fit great! couldn\\'t be happier with these. i ordered these palazzos with my fingers crossed and i was pleasntly surprised at the fit and the likeness to the photo. these pants are comfortable and fit well. i am happy with this purchase and will definatly  buy more of this label plus the delivery was swift. thank you amazon for understanding my needs i purchase the same pair of pants from a large sporting good store about 5 years ago. i knew i had to part with them, but couldn\\'t bear to do it until i replaced them with the exact same pair. finally found them on amazon!<br /><br />material and fit are nice for a basic lounge pant. don\\'t expect too much out of them if you are looking for a fitness pant though. loved the pants, however based on reviews at the holy clothing website i followed the owners advice to base size ordered on the sizing chart. the chart indicated a large stretched to 10 inches larger than actual measurement so i chose that size. needless to say they didn\\'t fit. this company who shipped them is at no fault. however, i\\'m out over $15 for shipping charges at each end i love these pants. they\\'re soft enough, not too thick, and have pockets. perfect for lounging around the game room. these pants are the best i have ever worn.  in fact, i bought the black pair and lighter color.  they hide any bumps and bulges and make you look 15 lbs lighter. my husband loved them. they fit just as well as all his previous ones. i wore this out to dinner with my family, and i received so many compliments!!! i wish it was in different colors. it fits just perfect. i paired it with a white tank top, a black blazer, and wore some black and gold pumps. looking for a good gym pant?  this is fabulous!..i have been buying crazee wear for years and these pants will last for more than 10 years when worn a few times a week.  this was a great purchase. ordered these in a size medium, which is my pre-pregnancy size.  i\\'m currently 8 months pregnant and wanted some attractive pajamas for the remainder of my pregnancy and for nursing.<br /><br />the pants fit perfectly.  the top fits fairly well, it\\'s a bit snug over my nearly full-term pregnancy belly.  the pull-down function looks like it will work well for nursing, and the camisole straps are adjustable.  the material is a pretty nice cotton - soft and lightweight, great for warmer weather.<br /><br />overall, based on fit & style, i really love these pajamas.  just wish this seller was an amazon prime partner so returns to belabumbum weren\\'t so expensive! these pants are great. i ordered a 2x and they r too big but i will be ordering smaller size. they do show off curves so if you don\\'t have cellulite then they are great. i didn\\'t realize these pants were lined with a flannel type lining.  they will be good for colder weather.  they came through the wash just fine.  the waist and length were just right, but won\\'t last through another growth spurt.  hopefully, my grandson will still fit in them when and if the weather ever gets colder.  we\\'re in california. overall great for the look we were going for.  a little snug in the thighs and loose at the waist, but they are mens, not womens, so it was not a surprise. elastic a bit loose.<br />the fastening arrangement not to well.<br />material is good. stretchy, not see through, but the fabric isn\\'t all that soft. very comfy and the pant legs are long enough. stocking up on more since they are so affordable! <3 the material is thin but being somewhat fit, not a big deal. my son loved it!! these run a little small but i was prepared for that from other reviews so i\\'m very pleased with these! i ordered 2 pairs of these at separate times. first time was a black medium and they fit well but quickly stretched out a bit as some other reviewers have said. i went ahead and ordered another pair though, because they\\'re quite comfortable, this time the charcoal in medium.  the charcoal ones almost seem to be made of a thicker, more elastic material. they fit nice and snug and have quickly become my favorite pants.  i checked the tags to see if maybe they were different brands, but they\\'re identical.  i may buy a couple other colors and see what the differences are.<br /><br />overall though, i do enjoy both pairs.  very comfortable. nice and long (i\\'m 5\\'7 with fairly long legs).  not as thin as some other yoga/lounge pants i\\'ve purchased in the same price range. i love these! they are stretchy and comfortable, and they are just the right size! everything just about, said about these yoga pants was true.  i hesitated, because i did not know whether to order a medium or large since they were juniors, but from the reviews, i took others\\' advice and got medium.  i am 5\\'4&#34; and 128 lbs.  they are perfect, soft and comfortable.  i love the royal blue.  as other reviewers said, they are a little long, but they may shrink and can be hemmed easily enough if you sew, and i do, although it is a little tricky hemming jersey material.  i wanted these for a long time, and for $12.99, they are a bargain.  now i have them, and plan to wear them to yoga. cool these are great‚Äîcute, soft and an excellent fit on my tall son. i\\'m becoming quite a fan of burt\\'s bees baby clothing. highly recommended for those newborn days. i would give these a 5, but they are see through, so i always have to wear shorts over them. love these, they are comfy, fit perfectly, make you look slimmer, hides any un-perfections you may have in the stomach area, you can move and these are way better then the victoria secret pants and way cheaper. i plan on ordering more in other colors..love them i ordered a large but when i went to try them on they fit kind of small and somewhat tight but i am happy with them. i love that they are extra long :) these pants are no frills, which is fine with me as i mainly use them for my kid\\'s sleepwear.  they are a little large, but they leave plenty of room to grow into.  i also bought the 0-3 months set, and am still using them at 4 months without issue (and i have a big kid).  i\\'m guessing these will likely work until 12 months i like these pants, they are very comfortable - they look better than wearing sweat pants or pajamas around the house.  they are long but i only have 31&#34; inseam, so i need to shorten them.  the seller did an excellent job of getting me to me quickly and in perfect condition so i would recommend this seller and i would purchase from the seller again. i haven\\'t had a chance to wear these &#34;out&#34; yet, but i have tried them on and they fit perfectly. they appear to be made exactly like regular uniform bdu pants i\\'ve worn for years. soft, and the elastic band is perfect for the big tummy of my bb;  i will buy more for sure.. i bit pricy it is more than what i expected these are super cute pants and wash nicely too! great fit and easy to care for. i\\'m in my 30s and pretty curvy so i purchased a large in navy.  i love them! very soft and comfortable! very cute and comfy. shipping was very fast. this cute thermal set is exactly what my son needed it fits well and described perfectly in the description. the size is marked as 0-12 months.  it is obviously too large for most of those months, but i ordered it with the intention my baby can wear it next summer.  it is so cute and i can\\'t wait for her to wear it! love these pants. i\\'m 5\\'4\\'\\', 116 lbs, usually wearing a small and these fit perfect! love the design as well! i usually have the problem of my shorts riding up while running, and this is just the perfect length - it doesn\\'t even ride up that much. i think it\\'s really the worth the money paid for! they fit great and seem very durable! the side cinches work great for me! i love the style, they are well made. i wear them with my nursing scrub tops, they go great and are warmer than scrub pants. i\\'m ordering more! these are my new favorites. i like that they run a bit bigger, i took the advise to go a size smaller and they are perfectly roomy! would prefer a shorter pant. love these! arrived super early too! very comfortable and beautifully made. i bought u turn 381 and 1119. after trying them on i feel i am equally in love with both. only difference to me is the style. i will order more colors from the u turn line. you cannot go wrong owning one pair or several pairs.<br />i love these pants they hug every curve and molds to my body. my legs/thighs look leaner and butt is looking sexy.<br /><br />i placed an order for 4 items from fashion2love. this order rates as one of my best online shopping experiences. the seller miri responds very quickly to email. she also provides her personal phone number and email with your purchase. if there are any questions or problems she is available because she wants to ensure the customer is satisfied with the purchase. she was so helpful!!!<br /><br />i felt like i had a sales associate with me just like when i am in the store. she was able to answer all of my questions regarding sizing. if you are in doubt about what to purchase email miri with your waist and hip measurements.<br /><br />i am going to order additional items from fashion2love. i will be a lifelong customer as long as they are in business. wow---what a beautiful christmas dress ! it arrived quickly to canada, & am so pleased with this purchase. couldn\\'t find a nicer one in my city for that price ! i. enjoy exercising in these yoga pants.  they fit well according to what size you request and are quite comfortable. i have always exercised in sweats.  i have been losing weight. this is my reward for hard work.  i am looking for to future rewards. exactly what i paid for!!!!! these jean are the best buy that i ever, most satisfied. also they fit really well, i look forward to purchasing more in the future. my niece loved them. i spent considerable time reading the review to make sure i got something that fit well. i went back and forth multiple times between this one (drskin) and tesla. i was worried at all the comments on tesla about order a size larger than typical. then some people liked them, others really did not. sol ultimately, i settled on the drskin compression set and it was a great choice!<br /><br />i am 6\\'2 and 203 lbs. i ordered the xl and they are great. they fit exactly as expected.<br /><br />i bought these to wear under my shorts when i bike in the chilly early morning hours. these definitely keep me warm when i first get out (low 50\\'s). then, when it warms up a bit, the fabric breathes very nicely.<br /><br />if you are like me and not sure which ones to choose....get these! you will not be disappointed. i will be back to get more no doubt. a gift for our granddaughter. parents loved it i am a patient coordinator for a mobile imaging unit so i have to have different color scrubs depending on what location i am going to. i didn\\'t want to spend too much on each set. i was very impressed with the quality of these scrubs and the price was just right. love this- the pattern is gorgeous and the style is so comfortable, but despite getting the one recommended for my size- there\\'s no way it would fit. they\\'re not the best quality and they\\'re a big long, but they\\'re super comfortable and they\\'ve lasted many washes already. i ended up buying another pair in another color and probably will get another on top of that. great fit, very comfortable. love these. super cute and lasted forever, bought two new pairs! i will forever be a kp fan! the absolute softest material! the bunny print is adorable and perfect for easter and spring! got them in a week so, so far so good.<br />i don\\'t seem nothing wrong with them, and they fit perfectly:) i was looking for dance pants that were comfortable and modern looking. i am a size 6, regular pants and i got the medium. it fits perfectly. i read mixed reviews saying they fit slim, and other say they fit big. ok, they are harem pants, they have to hang, period. that\\'s the look i\\'m going for. they look exactly like in the picture, but a little bit thinner, which i don\\'t mind because other wise they would be too hot for dancing. soft cotton and stretchy. super comfortable. i almost bought the large after reading the reviews but decided for the medium. it fits just right on my 29.5 in waist, and my 14.5in calves, and they still have some room to stretch. large would have been too big. their length is right too, for a 5\\'4\\'\\' tall woman. i may buy other colors. recommended if you feel comfortable wearing harem pants/baggie pants. :) love them...i wear a 12 long so i guessed they ran small...i was right but the length is great! cool comfy, soft and functional while being cute.  i\\'d recommend. run small.  material is really nice though. excelente exceeded expectations. great for boys too. it\\'s very difficult to find high waisted jeans/leggings and i cannot believe how amazing these are!  the fabric is dense making your legs look sleek and waist is high enough to help cover that extra inch.  i am 5\\'5&#34; , 135 pounds, i bought the size 9 and 11 because i wasn\\'t sure which would be best, and i\\'m keeping them both! the size 9 is a dream , and 11 is a little looser but because it sits so comfortably at the waist it doesn\\'t make you feel like you\\'re swimming in it.  my waist is smaller than my hips and i love that it accommodates curves.  as a bonus this arrived so quickly i was astounded. these pants rock.  i\\'ve had another pair of thai fishermans pants that ran me about 25$ and those ripped within a week of yoga practice. i\\'ve been wearing these quite a bit.  they\\'re well made and they look great.  no one else in the class has pants like this ;)  they also cost 1/2 as much as a pair of yoga pants i was looking at previously.  they truly are unisex, they look great on men or women.  i think you\\'ll be pleased! i\\'m really glad i ordered these. they are fun to wear now and again. they are a little bit see through though so that\\'s kinda a bummer. fits great, although i normally wear a size 10 p i did order the larger size to accommodate wide hips and thighs and i am glad i did. i\\'m 5\\'10, 120, and these are just a wee bit too short for me. they are true to the picture with a shiny, ski-pants type of spandex feel. with the pelvis and hips, the pattern is such that it will give the illusion of curves (or accentuate the ones you have), so if you are hippy, beware. the bum does not go see through when you bend over (hurrah!). they do not bag. definitely a unique find. just got these fleece cargo pants today and was so happy. these pants are so soft and they fit peeerrrrfic!!! i will surely be ordering another pair. thanks amazon always dependable brand for fit and quality. forgiving of the older figure without being baggy. good product. these training pants hold up wash after wash. i have washed them every morning after my son wears them at night and they maintained their shape and padding doesn\\'t shift or anything. my son is potting trained, so we just use these training pants at night. i will say though they are not as absorbent as say a &#34;pull up&#34; . if your child wets excessively at night, you may still notice some leaking. i still think pants are great product, just may not be as absorbent for night time use. comfortable and stylish (i get lots of compliments on them). they are a little thin, and the fabric stretches after you wear them for a little while. certainly worth what i paid though. very happy with this purchase the pants work as advertised, does work up a sweat and the high waist stays put.  would buy the brand again. inseam a little short i bought these because i wanted tight pants, but i also wanted something covering my crotch at dance rehearsals [because frankly, i can\\'t get pants that are tight enough for me without having weird tightness in the crotch].  these have that thing in front and it works very well.  i made a cut along the seam at the bottom so i could tie up the pants if i needed to, i\\'ve seen pants that have that already, but these don\\'t, so i just quickly cut and seamed them and can now tie the bottoms up if i\\'m doing floor work or something.<br />very comfortable.<br />would buy again. my daughter loves them! it\\'s not too snug (not loose either) and really follows the contour of your body.<br />it\\'s not as tight as the sub sports brand or the under armour brand but that\\'s how i like it, and it really does keep you warm.<br /><br />it\\'s easier to fit your foot through the leg openings compared to others brands and still keeps out the wind from coming in.<br /><br />i&#34;m 5\\'6 with a 29 waist and the small fit me perfectly. love it thank you these pants are great. very comfortable. not too thin not too thick or tight. just a very nice soft cotton stretchy pant. length was good too. i am 5\\'8 and i like to have an inseam of at least 33&#34;. i ordered a medium if curious. they are comfy pants to excersize in thanks you guys are awesome an t has a diamond on the front im about 5\\'7 and these fit perfectly. they are a tad bit long but its not a problem. theyre thick and the best yoga pants ive found. theyre the only pair i can find that fits my waist and my leg length. i love these pants, they are thick enough to wear everyday, but you don\\'t get too hot in them!!!! i wear them to work all the time, and nobody notices that they are yoga pants!!!! ok, nice and fluffy; runs small though. the measures where acurate, nice cut, surprinsinly fresh and cool, i was expecting a sweat box, since i live in a tropical country but no. overall very good product, and a very cheap price i love these pants.  very soft fabric and comfortable.  i have the lighter grey ones also and they seem to be a bit longer than the dark grey.  i\\'m 5\\'9&#34; so longer is better.  i just ordered 3 more grey and 1 dark grey to have at home, my daughters when i visit her and our cabin.  i was thinking of getting the pink ones but the review on them wan\\'t good... i bought these pants for my husband who is serving overseas. he wore them for 2 months during the harsh desert winter and said they did fantastic. he is a rather tall guys and sometimes has problem with length and seams tearing but these pants did well and did not \\\\\\\\\"wear\\\\\\\\\" where his weapon set everyday. he said they were almost too warm. so i would reccomend these to anyone serving in a constantly cold environment. i ordered these and their \\\\\\\\\"tight\\\\\\\\\" counterpart. there\\'s almost no difference between the 2. both are of course rayon (wash, but hang dry), and have the same features. at 6\\'5\\\\\\\\\" the xl fit well enough and are tucked into boots anyway. the \\\\\\\\\"loose\\\\\\\\\" is really more in the thighs than the groin, and side by side you can\\'t tell much difference between these and the tight ones. i love these pants! they arrived much faster then i expected and they are exactly what i wanted! my only suggestion is the use of a slightly softer fabric. material a bit thin, but pants are cute and looks the same as the picture. love them!!! need to order a smaller size to be perfect i received these earlier than expected and they were the quality and size/fit that i had expected. love these!!! i wear them whenever i can!!! they are so comfortable!! the leggings fit just great. very comfortable! so this is my third child and i wish that i had found these with my first!  they are so soft and comfortable, comform to her body without being tight.  i use them a lot under my daughter\\'s sleep sacks and they will be very useful as a bottom layer this winter.  i\\'m back for more colors! these pants are very cool looking.  the only problem is i am a size 0 & these are a size 1.  they fit nice but are a little lose around the hips & butt. its fun to wear and different. my infant is cloth diapered with flats and thirstie covers. but most pants out there are too narrow, assuming your baby is in disposables. i purchased the 3-6 month size and they were perfect! very roomie, soft and comfy.  he looks like a mini old man, a bit hilarious at first until he grews into them. but, i like how comfortable my baby is, how easy they are to get on, and he\\'s comfortable. that\\'s what\\'s most important.  i\\'m not squeezing him into narrow pants.<br /><br />i liked these so much that i bought the 6-9 month size.  i\\'ll have to update whether those are too wide or not, because the thirstie covers don\\'t come in a larger size than size 2, which he\\'s already in. so, i\\'m not sure if he\\'ll grow much wider long term or not. he seems to get fatter, then grow taller, then fatter again etc... but they worked so well at the 3-6mo size i\\'m willing to spend more to try them again in this larger size. i haven\\'t found another brand that works as well for cloth diapers. good for how much they cost. i am 5\\'9 and a m fit love these yoga pants. very comfortable and fit true to size. love these pants i never thought i\\'d buy &#34;harem pants&#34; but was looking for something comfy to wear after a day in the sun.  these work perfectly!  they are not only comfortable but really quite stylish.  i wear them as a one-piece outfit and get loads of compliments on them every time i wear them. background you can skip<br />i am a 40r suit, 5\\'11\\\\\\\\\" 185 lbs. the m first me perfectly.<br />i decidedly did not want the skin tights for running because i simply do not feel comfortable in them. mostly because it accentuates my flaws in my 40+ body (cellulite bum, anyone, anyone, bueller, bueller).<br />i also didn\\'t want the loose training pants because with 5 mile+ runs and heavy sweating those can really start to chafe given that the fabric tends to hold moisture and is thicker and those creates more friction.<br /><br />so i looked and looked and found a couple of pants online that i decided to buy since they looked exactly like what i was looking for:<br />loose fitting tights: not tight, not loose, not a thin fabric, not a thick fabric.<br />the 3 pairs i bought on amazon were in 3 different price categories, from cheapest to most expensive:<br />- these ron hill gt\\'s (around 25 bucks incl. shipping)<br />- asics men\\'s aptitude 2 (around 50, but seen for as low as 35)<br />- gore running wear men\\'s essential loose tights (around 75 but seen as low as 50)<br />i know you might think that i am overdoing it with 3 pairs but anyone that runs for exercise deserves to spend a little bit on the gear. running is the cheapest sport out there i think and there is nothing wrong with some great shoes and comfortable gear. you\\'re still more economic than the person buying hundreds of dollars of brand name golf gear...<br /><br />they are all similar in cut but the fabrics are wildly differing and the experience when wearing is different so i found that i wear each in different circumstances. it would not be fair to pitch these 3 pants against each other because they are of different quality and each is worth their price. the only place i think i can make a fair statement is around the price vs quality (i.e. what you get for your money) and in that case the ron hill wins hands down. it has also become my most worn pair and i just ordered an extra pair 6 months in as i got worried that they might go out of production and i would not want to live any longer without these.<br /><br />about the ron hill\\'s<br />first off, these pants are very carefully made. i always look for crooked stitching or loose threads or misaligned panels, i\\'m ocd like that. but these are very very well made. even if they clocked at the 50 dollar price point they would have held up. i.e. they are no less quality fabricated than the asics.<br />the fabric is, even though the description does not say it, of medium thickness. it is not as thin or polyester-ish as the  skin tights but feel like a loose spandex yoga pants. i.e. a little thicker and stretchy in all directions.<br />it does not ride, rub or stick against your skin even if you sweat profusely. not even where the thighs meet. they also do not soak moisture, they wick. they have a fancy name for it, exertec 100 (tough, lightweight, breathes and does not strap when running).<br />my coolmax running underwear is still wet when these are already dry.<br /><br />all in all, i love this fabric. it is thick enough to go for a run in with this as the outer layer in 32f  and thin enough to still be comfortable at 60f on a run: very versatile.<br />the foot straps are great. nothing gets tangled up and nothing rides up. also like flat seamed wider waist band with draw cord: you really do not feel these pants on your waist.<br /><br />the blue is very dark. like a midnight blue and i have them with a bright red band. there is also nothing reflective on it so be aware that you should wear shoes with clear reflection or a reflective top or cap as these are not made to highlight you.<br /><br />regarding the fit: they are very flattering. my cellulite doesn\\'t show and it makes my huge calves look normal. they also do not rub the hair on my tighs which other pants tend to inflame. they also are loose enough in the groin area that you do need worry that you\\'re showing contours etc. just very flattering is the best i can describe.<br /><br />for the 25 dollars these are offered for i think these are a must have and would be a staple in any runners arsenal. i think the price point is making people think they need to shell out more and go for the asics or more towards the 50 dollar range in general as most of these boston track pants , loose tights or soccer trainers (however you want to call them) are more in that price range. again, let there be no mistake: i would spend double on these and still be very very happy with them. at this price point i am delirious with joy. i love these pants.<br /><br />about the seller: they ship fast and communicate well. the shipping at 5 bucks from the uk is very reasonable. i am not sure but believe that customs could in theory make you pay for importing these yet i have rarely had that happen with stuff i bought online and it would be very little. so don\\'t worry about it coming from the uk, these guys are trustworthy and efficient.<br /><br />in summary<br />pros<br />- quality build<br />- high quality fabric that stretches, wicks and does not rub<br />- versatile in wide temperature range<br />- long lasting quality: after 6 months of use there is no visible wear on my first pair<br />- the cut is very flattering and fits very comfortably<br />- price: at this price point these cannot be beat.<br />- foot straps are great<br /><br />cons:<br />- maybe a reflective stripe would have been great for evening and early am visibility<br />- the women\\'s version is twice as expensive? why...<br /><br />truly a 5 star item. spread the word.escribe.<br /><br />for the 25 dollars these are offered for i think these are a must have and would be a staple in any

them! ben davis will always get you out  of a jam ,for they look cool and they also can be worn in the work place whether it be an office or any other kind of work place! color is amazing! they run true to size and they last a long time. they are well put together and they are worth the price!! i love my friskos! i love these i am six foot and they are a little long which is a great thing so many pants are too short. i will be ordering more. the shorts were perfect.  10% cotton as described. i love these tights they are very comfortable and great  price. love them sizing good and comfortable so nice to find these pants in a lavender!  and with the flat front! i bought these lounge pants for my daughter for her birthday. she loved them, she lives in her p.j.s. great pants they are not to tight and best of all cannot see thru them these lounge pants are quite soft and very comfortable. the fit and sizing is as described but they run slightly small.<br />i\\'m a small but i prefer a loose fit so i ordered the medium and it\\'s perfect. the drawstring accommodates an expanding tummy after a big meal!<br />i plan to wear them indoors to lounge around. they are too casual and not suitable for the streets but very good for a cozy afternoon by the fireplace. after having stumbled on these on amazon, i am hooked. the sizing is accurate, the belt comfortable. the pockets are huge, i can get an entire 18 volt battery drill in the back pocket and i can still move to work. i work for a guy and we do anything from building walls to plumbing and the pants are durable and handy. no need for a tool belt here (as long as you keep your belt tight)! they do seem to be a bit less warm even the lightweight version but all the pros far outweight the one con i can come up with. this product fit exactly as indicated.  i am 5\\'6&#34; and wear a size 10, therefore i ordered a medium and it fit like capri pants.  i love them!  i wear these to my cross fit and hiit classes and i have sweat dripping down my legs!  the product is durable and well made.  i will reorder in a smaller size once i no longer fit the current size i\\'m wearing. like them these pants are thick enough to hug the body nicely, and are a pleasure to move in.  i\\'m an athletic pear shape, slender waist and abs, big behind and thick thighs, and i find the fit very flattering and supportive for my body type, i feel better and more confident when i\\'m wearing these, thus i tend to play better.<br /><br />if anything, they are slightly too long for me when wearing snickers (i\\'m 5\\'7\\\\\\\\\", 165 lbs, bought these in size l), but since the material is slightly \\\\\\\\\"grippy\\\\\\\\\", i can kinda re-distribute the pant length upward to shorten it slightly (repeat as needed) :)  comfortable, moisture-wicking, retain shape nicely throughout the day or a workout.  i scored this pair and a similar capris at a local grocery outlet for like $10/pair though :))) my husband loves these sweat pants.  they wash beautifully and he finds them comfortable when taking it easy. i will have to loose some weight,are to tie to me,133 lbs,to be exaclty like on  the picture,all good in rest excelente having been a wearer of cords all my life, these have to be the best. an expandable waist for when ive guzzled too much food, fabulous! these particular pants match a shirt i have.<br>i take my cap off to them. great pants nice and lose and stretchy. love them perfect! this is the new style, that is the old style from the 70\\'s my son love them, and would like new colors. fits as expected and good quality. i love these pants!  i have already worn them a few times i saw other product reviews saying runs small but this fits as expected... the only issues i found was getting it on they should have a button or zipper on the top part to make it easier, also shipment was late i am very petite and all of my scrubs always look huge on me. these were the perfect size and are very comfortable. they shipped fast. i am very satisfied and will order from them again. i am 5\\'5&#34; 135 pounds, got a size small and they fit to perfection.  extremely comfy and are made in the u.s.a. a little short but overall okay. surprisingly, i have to shorten them a bit.  otherwise, very nice. high quality material, draw string was perfect.the material is very comfortable. my friends are all waxing nostalgic after seeing these. like it ! these are a bit small but i do yoga & my instructor is able to make sure i\\'m doing yoga poses correctly-i love them! in love i don\\'t like the elastic in the waist of pants but other then that fit perfect thank you these pants are a good value for the money, fabric and construction are good ... even if the fit runs small. i like hot pants. love these pants! have them in thunder and acorn. colors wash up nicely/dont fade. my son can not keep socks on if his life depended on it. for some reason footie pants are super hard to find, these fit the bill perfectly. wish they weren\\'t $15 each because he grows out of things so quickly.... but they have been worth it! he is 3.5 months old and 16 pounds, wears the 3-6 month size and they fit him perfectly right now. he is a very tall baby though, so if your baby is shorter they will fit them for a longer period of time. considering buying more of these in the next size up! washes well. soft. loose fitting and comfortable.  kids wore them from about 9 months to 2 years of age.  excellent price and value. the columbia early autumn bdu pants are just right for cool weather scouting and hunting.<br />you will find these are just what you need. i am very satisfied with their quality. they launder well and feel great. i have yet to be disappointed with any of my columbia purchases. like the right tool for the job, the right weight clothes makes all the difference for hunting in comfort. the early autumn bdu pants have been a great addition to my assortment of hunting clothes. don\\'t forget to put a [[asin:b0002a7dps camouflage bandana]] in your pocket. ~ the boss these are great pajamas and well worth the money.  they are lightweight, stretchy, and form fitting.  they are mostly bamboo based rayon, which breathes well.<br /><br />our son is in the 95th percentile for height and weight so these fit great starting at 9 months very breathable and stretchable material. allow me to workout at the club without over heating and provide a method to hide my legs. super comfy these pants definitely make you sweat i use sweet sweat cream on different parts of my  body prior to working out and it helps intensify the sweating. the only negative thing i can say is they are not capris like you see in the picture, they come all the way down to my ankle.  i wish they were more of a capri pants, regardless i would buy again for sure! i am giving this seller the highest rating because he responded extremely courteously and within literally minutes to my email about what i thought was a problem that turned out not to be.<br /><br />the pants are cut slightly small and low-waisted in the current fashion (which is not my personal preference) but i should have expected that and they fit pretty much as they should.  and, of course, this is an issue with the manufacturer, which is a well-known brand, not the seller. there is nothing like a great pair of pallazzo pants to make your legs look miles long. the fabric is that kind of knit that travels well whether it\\'s in a bag or on the body. very cool to wear. the length is perfect for me because during the summer i love to wear sbicca wedges. these are great at home, for the summer parties, vacations, work? maybe, but for the price you can\\'t beat a great pair of palazzos. i love the vivid, bright colors. super soft and fit just as i had hoped this pants seem to be exactly the size they\\'re supposed to be. fairly light weight material, nice looking pants. they are marked as extra roomy in the seat and thighs which i didn\\'t really want but they aren\\'t too baggy on me and i am fairly slim. they seem to be well made and i am happy with them. i shouldn\\'t be required to write a disortation about a product that i rate at 5 stars. that should tell everyone that i like the product. love bought these for my dad a few months ago, and he wears them all the time.  they\\'re true to size and the fabric is comfortable.  the print is vibrant.  overall great product. my cousin didn\\'t complain so i suppose she liked it though i\\'ve not seen her wear it. very flattering! very nice fit on top but as i am 5\\'11&#34; a little more length would have been better for me. great perfect fit, wonderful feel.  i wear a size 10and the medium size fit just right  i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; and the length was also perfect  i could live in these and probably will got these for a 80\\'s party! fit as leggings do usually and not see through. didn\\'t have much expectations on this product at first. when it came i put them on and it was like magic! they are comfortable, breathable and like another reviewer said &#34;just enough cling&#34; i am a larger woman and this does not show extra dimples or folds that i did not want seen. will order more soon. i guess at my age i should have learned to read the description instead of looking at the picture. anyway, for the price i was expecting a top and a bottom but (as it clearly states) these are only bottoms. that said, my wife loves them. they fit well and look great! love these pants, comfy and long enough for a 5\\'10&#34; thick chick. ill be getting more colors! i like this product cause my boyfriend who owns this account buys this pajamas for me, the top is great cause of the breast pocket which is big enough for me to put my car keys or some change and even my cellphone i also put my pack of cigarettes too in the pocket and its great i wish the pants had pockets too cause then it would make these more functional. these pants fit great. i love everything about them.  i don\\'t understand why they areonly available in black though.  i would buy them in every colour.  great for work. super comfy pants.  i love them. i usually order a size large so my pants won\\'t be too tight...but these are a little big.  i wanted to order a medium but they were already out of stock.  just order a size smaller super cute and very confortable fast delivery..ordered friday and got them monday. fit perfect and looks amazing on. i am only 5 feet 1 inch tall so these will need to be altered , maybe try to take 3 to 4 inches off the length , the color and pattern is what i expected , they feel a little thin but nice for spring, summer, and fall , and again so comfortable to wear for a middle age women ,  personally i  prefer the maxi skirts ,because you can fold waist over, better and i have not have too alter any of them, if your a person who is 5 feet 5 inches these probably wll be nice with heals or flats much better than the picture  officially my new favorite pants  with these pants and the compliments won\\'t stop  fit perfectly, well made & quality fabric  i can\\'t wait to buy all the harem pants from ellazhu!!! first, they arrived before \\\\\\\\\"estimated\\\\\\\\\"  and second, they are completely adorable...  just as a side note, they are very bright, fuzzy and warm - so definately a winter buy, but not a bad find - especially for my little sister, who loves alice in wonderland. comfortable and attractive. they are even more comfortable after washing. i am considering purchasing more. i did have to hem them to fit my short frame 5 ft i got two pairs, will buy more, no doubt. they are sharp looking so as i lounge around my house in comfort i needn\\'t worry how i look if someone drops by. run a little small but my son loved them!! nice pants. they are very comfortable and wash well. i tumbled them and then put them on a hanger and they were fine; little wrinkling. may order another pair in a different color. these are the most comfortable tube top/pants that i have ever worn. i am a mom of three and i need comfy and this product fits amazing and feels amazing and is more comfortable than sweat pants. i purchased three of these. i have machine washed and dried with no issues at all. i have worn as a tube top set and also with a comfy shirt while using this product as pants. extremely flexible (especially because i have a newborn), the stretchiness really helped for comfort. bought this for my son\\'s girlfriend for christmas.  she loved it.  the pattern is crisp and clear.  the material is awesome hits all the curves just right. these preppy plaid pants caught my eye as i was looking for different apparel.  i love that they come in a multitude of colors.  i just have one problem, i am 5\\'11\\\\\\\\\" and can\\'t purchase these due to they would be a very awkward length.  not long enough, but not short enough either.  i would think thses designers would wake up and realize people are getting taller these days.<br />anyone else without 3\\' legs would have a lot of cute choices to pick the perfect look.<br /><br />lisa, (to long in the inseam, bummer)<br />centennial, co. material is very soft and comfortable.  they didn\\'t shrink when washed and i love the print!! i would give 5 stars but i am 5.1 and these are a bit too long for me but i love them they are comfy stretchy and perfect for my body other than the length! the pants were nice. they were darker, much darker than the picture depicts. they were the color of a cardboard moving box, not the softer khaki color in the photo. i am a petite woman, (5\\'2\\\\\\\\\"0 and wear a size 8/10 and even the small was too big for me. looking to get an xtra small. luckily one of my co workers loved them and bought them from me, so i didn\\'t have to return them. just get these :) they fit really nicely and the quality is good. for the price you really can\\'t go wrong. nice pack. i am obsessed with these leggings. i work at a bar and i get compliments all day with these on. they are sexy and edgy and i could wear them everyday. before purchasing, i was afraid they would be a little too slutty to wear out but they are not! definitely recommend these. i am very pleased with these pants! they look exactly as pictured. i am 5 feet tall and they are the perfect length with a small heel. a little thin but that is fine. great for summer and comfy pants for pettite woman. purchased size small, color: sexy gold brown tan black giraffe leopard animal print.<br />they are very very beautiful. the fabric isn\\'t cheap and you can feel the quality & weight of the material.  the fabric flows, silky and  absolutely love the wide legs.<br />the waist is high but i fold it down to see how it looks (looks good both ways) , but to  me it looks good up with a wide elastic cinch belt.  well made nicely hem.<br />the color is rich just as pictured.  i\\'m 5\\'7 132 lbs, i\\'m giving my height weight due to front crouch of the pants sits low as pictured,  so i  folded waist, pulled them up (but recommend don\\'t pull up too high (reveals sacred area).<br />length: 45.5 in long (fabric hits the floor on me), nice for heels.<br />hope this help if trying to determine fit/sizing. nice very comfortable pants washes well these pants make my wife\\'s rear look fantastic. can\\'t say much more than that. the material isn\\'t quite sheer, but won\\'t offer too much warmth in the winter. probably light enough for summer use thanks, fit nice these are not jeggins or like legging pants that you would wear with a croped top as shown. they are more like heavy tights, they have a crotch panel just like panty hose. but they are really cool looking and comfy. they look great with an over sized top that hangs past the crotch area or even a tee shirt/ sweater dress would be cute with them. also the customer service was really great and helpfull too! i love it i am 5\\'3 117 lbs wanting to weat them to dance in and they need to be tight but comfy at the am time will these be too loose to dance in by them selves worked great for halloween. i still use it for parties from time to time. it\\'s holding up nicely they are very stylish. i usually wear wear a large but had to exchange for an extra large to get a better fit. they are beautiful on. i went to a communion event and received lots of compliment. these pants are so adorable. i have to wear leggings under them because they are a bit see through, but it\\'s worth it. she wears a size medium in junior and they fit her fine. nice to wear under skirts as there are not lines. these are fantastic and high quality material and construction.  super cute summer pants for the office and out and about wear. these pants are super comfortable. they arrived at my house 2 days before the expected date. i had ordered other clothes from allegra k and they all showed up in great condition! i love the fabric used for the pants, it\\'s absolutly perfect for summer, since it never gets too hot. love it!  -k. sanchez (wife) i love the material; they\\'re very easy to move around in.<br />my only problem was the size. they\\'re supposedly one size fits all. ladies, if you have a butt, these will not fit you. i am about 5\\'6&#34;, 140lbs, and i have a big butt. these barely go over my butt. they\\'re more like boyshort undies. i still wear them to workout in the privacy of my own home, but i wouldn\\'t dare wear these in public. now if you are petite, they\\'re perfect for you! the pants arrived today and they are great.  thank you i would definitely buy from you again. wear these all the time and love them! you can feel the quality. so soft! i purchased this to make a costume for my newborn for our christmas cards. she wore it all the time. the fabric is so soft and the little butt flap is so adorable. love!!! fits ok. tons of great comments when i wear them. this is my second pair of pants from the haggar maria. i love the tummy smoother. i typically wear a woman\\'s xl-xxl (18-20 us size) and these fit me well, there a bit more snug in the hips and thighs and slightly flare out, which is the &#34;palazzo&#34; style. i was looking for a spandex material and these are it and look nice enough to wear for a night out. i pared them with a spandex cowl neck top and you can\\'t tell the difference in the fabric. arrived in 2 days (amazon prime shipping). will defiantly be purchasing more. the only word to describe them is amazing !  i have purchased three pairs and i think i will be getting more of them as gifts.  they are so comfortable and i\\'m tall they actually reach up to my bra (if i want them to).  they give a solid look, slimming, and attractive. i wear a small in all my yoga pants and these wear a little big on me. hit and sexy,  just need to lose about 5 lbs...then watch out really comfortable! i was surprised when i used this the first time.  it actually works.  when you have gained just that little bit where it is hard to snap those pants this is the best solution i\\'ve found wife loves them, she takes them to the gym mostly. i use these and i treat them hard.<br />no quarter given and they get streached and used very hard in the sand, mud and still look good in inspections.<br />these are a  must have. fits my curves to a tee. sexy says the men. love them!!!! i bought one, then another, then 2!  so i\\'m a happy amazon customer on this one!  i hope they continue to make these.  the fabric is heavy and of good quality, and the fit is fine -- a little low at the waist but got used it and like it.  it\\'s now one of the essential parts of my winter \\\\\\\\\"uniform.\\\\\\\\\"  comes in a plastic bag -- be careful if you use something sharp to open it!  i cut the fabric once. my brother in law dom bought me a pair of these pants for christmas last year. i\\'d heard the stories but never believed him. luckily for us, mom needed more canned pumpkin so we volunteered to go to the store.  once we were outside, we put our powerful striped pants on (dom always keeps a spare set in the trunk.) we were careful our legs didn\\'t touch as we drove down the street, not wanting the powers to combine and explode the world. we stopped at a red light and a lady of the night approached our window. i rolled it down. she started to give us her spiel then noticed our pants. not another word was said. she climbed through the window and sat between us. dom pulled away as she pulled out pants down and began \\\\\\\\\"skiing the moguls\\\\\\\\\". after we finished she thanked us and gave us her switchblade and a roll of twenties. we bought the canned pumpkin and made two more stops on the way home, both free. i am now a multi-millionaire. thank you zubaz pants. they fit perfectly and are super comfortable!!! :d thank you awesome! given as gift loose in the bottom, wrinkles easily, but they fit nicely. these looked cheap but fit and feel great. keep there shape even after hours of wear.  can\\'t find the same thing anywhere else. i have looked locally and found nothing similar or with the same quality. luckily i also ordered an additional pair in blue. would order again. gave these s a birthday gift to my brother and he loved them. he said they fit great! very comfy, fits as expected. lots of compliments for it! great quality, long enough if you r 5\\' 2&#34;. legs run really thin/narrow.  nice size thick waste band pockets i love - hard to find! if you r normally a medium 5-7 i would order xl. sizing runs really small otherwise great product. really the n2n have a good quality but the size was arrived is large and in my order is medium but i will give 5 stars because i love the products . fast shipping - exactly as described - would buy again. they\\'re supper comfortable and cute. i  them mostly to just sit around of wear them to school on those lazy days. i wouldn\\'t recondite them as pants to use when working out because the material is pretty thin and gets those little balls on it. other than that, they are perfect for what they are advertised for, lounging about! i ordered these leggings for my 14 year old sister because thats what she loves. and she was overjoyed when i gave them to her and they fit her perfectly and she loved them. they are very well made and just excellent. very satisfied :) let\\'s just say, i wear it a lot. feels like pajama pants, but looks really classy worn with a black silk blouse and a long necklace, high heels, just what i have in mind i like it very much. it\\'s better than i thought. my daughter loved this outfit.  she prefers the one piece for her newborn and i ordered a few more so she doesn\\'t have to wash so often.  he was over 9 lbs. and 21 innches.  so i ordered a 3-6 mos. so he could grow a little into it.  the baby received lots of clothes but she prefers a one piece.  she was so excited because the fabric is so soft!  i would highly recommend this product. although some reviewers found the print to be blurry, i\\'ve received nothing but compliments on these, and questions as to whether or not they are tattoos.  the thickness is actually really good, and are more opaque than any leggings i\\'ve bought in stores. the fit was great, i am fairly athletic, 5\\'9 and 165 pounds, and there is no muffin top or uncomfortable fit.  while the print is certainly not anatomically correct, it looks super cool and will definitely get people\\'s attention! fit great  didn\\'t listen to every one reviewed but went with the size and it fits perfect.<br />smooth comfortable fast shipping<br />excellent will buy again i figured that i should order up a size or two because these are \\'junior\\' pants and i\\'m glad that i did. i usually wear a women\\'s large in track or lounge pants. they\\'re a little long but i suppose it\\'s because i ordered a much larger size. the material is soft, hasn\\'t had any pilling yet and i\\'ve washed them five or six times. had the product for a month, the screen print is holding up nice which is the only reason i bought these pants. happy to see an 80\\'s cartoon that i grew up on. i love the pants. they are skin tight but with a pouch large enough for my &#34;package&#34;. i wear a leather jock under them to make sure the pouch is full and smooth. the only complaint i might have is that the back waist is a little low. when i bend over, like at the gym, i have to be sure to pull the back of the pants back up. however, i realize that that is somewhat a result of the wonderful stretch of the fabric. i will be getting more . n2n and i go way back. arrived early. looks great and fits perfect. i ordered a small. i absolutely love it will definately order more. love it! the product looks so pretty the quality is so good, and fast shipping too, more beautiful than the picture! comfy the thing with these pants is something that i did not expect. yes, they are cruelly comfortable. you will never want to take them off. you will hate every other pant you\\'ve ever worn! yes, they are stylish. they have the perfect amount of harem sag in the middle. yes, the quality is surprisingly good, no amazing but good. they seem like they may wear out quicker than a lot of other pants, but the biggest problem, like i said, is not one that i at all anticipated. even though these pants are 95% cotton and 5% spandex, they are handwash only!!! i bought a large. i\\'m 5\\'8 and usually typically wear size 12-14 in pants. after wearing them all day through 2 airports, 2 plane rides, and a cab ride, they noticeably stretched out. not horribly, but as i said they became roomier. now, i still wore them a little baggy and didn\\'t mind. some people might though. however, i figured this wasn\\'t something that a good ole warm wash couldn\\'t fix. low and behold, handwash only?!?!!? what?! but they are cotton!! cotton comes preshrunk b/c everybody knows that if you throw cotton in a machine in warm water it\\'ll shrink a good size and a half or more. soooo, yea. just trust me. go with a size smaller, b/c there is really no way to shrink them back up. the stretching out isn\\'t horrible, as i said, but if you want tight harem pants i would take a hard pass on these. i love them though!! excellent price. perfect fit and very good quality. they\\'re comfy but a little small very good fit. good quality, fit just right. if you\\'re a real patriot, you need to pick up a pair of these bad boys. they\\'re comfortable and roomy. they feature a drawstring elastic waistband so even if you add on a few pounds they\\'ll compensate for you\\'re beer gut. they even have pockets for carrying stuff. don\\'t let terrorism win. perfect sometimes you get a package in the mail and are not sure what to expect -- i was just delighted with these sweet little pants. they are of excellent quality, are soft and organic with room to grow.  plus they have cute stitching detail.  they fit well and are quite easy to dress my little guy in.  they have become one of our go-to favorites!<br /><br />also, the brand and its social mission resonated with me.  i will definitely be coming back to purchase gifts! i picked up these pants for a music festival.  they are ridiculously comfortable, very light and breathable, and yet so far, very tough.    they\\'ve been danced in for hours, run through the woods, rolled through the dirt, soaked with rain, buried in mud, and wadded up muddy in the bottom of a bag for days.  but they\\'ve come through it all without any visible wear or discoloration so far.    i\\'m getting another pair or two... based on other reviews, i ordered up one size. normally i am a medium, but ordered large. perfect!<br />softest material and very comfy. wore them just hanging around house and added a scarf at waist to dress up for an evening out. i had been looking for tribal pants that i wouldn\\'t have to hem or take in and these work great.  i am 5\\'2\\\\\\\\\" and 105 lbs.  these fit very well.  i need to fold the waist band over once to get them to sit where i like it on my hips which is no big deal.  the material stretches too so they\\'re really comfortable and not restricting.  the flow of the material during spins is beautiful. i read reviews and decided to order up a size. i usually wear a 20w at old navy, lane bryant, etc. so i ordered these in black, size 22plus. they fit perfectly. my only complaint is the pockets on the back are so plain and ugly (like typical jeans). they could\\'ve done something a little nicer, but hey what do you expect for 22 bucks?? i use these pants to wear over my gym clothes. thankful for the larger size, making it easy to put on. i loved these pants so much, i reordered another pair...they are sooooo comfortable and very stylish...can wear pretty  anyplace.... great buy!  plaid very well matched at seams.  back pockets and faux fly a design &#34;plus&#34;.  very stylish and a real break from boring solids. i fell in love with the colors and pattern of the \\'tribal\\' print. they are just as pretty in person. i am 5\\'5 and 135 lb - ordered a size small and they are a little snug. i think i would like medium a little better, but the small will be fine. i love that you can cut the length to size. make sure to use sharp scissors! i cut them short enough to wear w/ flats but if i move the waist down my hips a little i can wear with heels. the fabric is wonderful, so comfy, and no wrinkles! this item is adorable and well-made. i can\\'t comment on the fit as it was a gift for a mother-to-be. my wife likes them. she says they fit great. they are kind of thin but i think that\\'s how yoga pants are supposed to be. for the price, i think its a good price. the pants fit wonderfully. they\\'re a tad long, and i\\'m 5\\'8&#34;, but the feel like i\\'m wearing pajamas. i\\'ve never owned a more comfortable pair of pants. these made michael look nice.  however, they are more an entertainment type of pant set.  this isn\\'t something you could pull off with wearing casually. i like the cargo idea, big pockets and the possible tear away section. these actually deliver on that. material is good, has the fabulous double pocket with magnetic close, and the bigger pockets on the pants are just there. put stuff in and it feels fine.<br />getting hot? zip off the bottoms.<br />the best part is they don\\'t look super casual, so i can get away with running them at work when i know i\\'m going to be doing messy or hot work.<br />they work really well as a casual pant, the zippers on the legs don\\'t get in the way or \\'feel\\' like they are there.<br />brillian work once more sev. i love the way this looks, but it is almost to short in the waist for a romper. i am 5\\'7 and 200 lbs. wearing this as pants will never be an option for me. if you are large breasted then you might have a problem with this being long enough. i ordered a xl, in teal. i like the color. haven\\'t washed it yet, so not sure about the reviews with the color bleeding. it is perfect for the grab and go outfit. it will be very cute with a long necklace. the elastic around the legs is loose enough, but you can also adjust the length by pulling them up or down and it stays in place. it is loose around the waist, which is great for me since i have a few extra rolls. :)  the fabric is cotton and it is very thin. i suggest getting a dark color so that you will not be seeing through it. long pants for slender legs. i am a long legged person @ 5\\'9\\' but there is 2 &#34; to spare on this pant. otherwise delightful. i was skeptical about buying these but i saw that boutiques were selling them for almost double the price and gave it a shot. i love them. my new favorite pair of pants.<br />i ordered them on a wednesday and received them that following tuesday. i like this workout fold over pants. my only issue is that they are a little long and i have to get them cut. they are comfortable and good quality. i can recommend to buy them. excellent 100% recommended thank you for the lovely wrapping and the cute nail file... nice touch !!!  :-) must say very sexy...i bought these because im big on tights...and i have similiar pink shoes...and the similiar body aswell...but you must be careful putting them on..as any other tights or stockings you might wear..i would wash them on gentle too .. so cute...take a risk... i love these pants, doesn\\'t take much to work up a nice sweat. these were fort son-in-law he was thrilled outstanding. comfy i actually bought these in a store and rushed home to order another pair in blue. i got these for emt pants. they fit great!!! the others that i had tried on came up to my belly button. i\\'m just not used to wearing pants with that high of an inseam. these fall lower on the waist and have a more slender leg. (the others i tried on had really puffy legs- seemed to be made for women with tiny waists and larger rear and thighs). i am 5\\'4 and weigh 117- kind of boy shaped. the quality is great on these. very pleased with product and probably will only buy this style from now on. i bought these to go under my costume, because i am a tall girl.. and most costumes are on the shorter side. man are these cute.. and well made! i was very surprised that the fit was so spot-on.. and the fabric is not cheap or too thin. i will definatley be putting these to good use!! comfortable and cute! i\\'d recommend inside out, the tag and seams are a little scratchy. very soft cotton, just thick enough to be absorbent for potty training accidents. thank you cute yoga pants that run just the slightest bit small. this is because (as the name states) they are juniors sizes. i am 5\\'1&#34; and 105 lbs and got a small. they fit perfectly but will be a tad to small if they shrink in the wash. ill make sure not to dry them. i would recommend to anyone buying these to take the &#34;juniors&#34; sizing into account when choosing a size. i usually wear a small and the small does fit me, its just a smaller small than usual....if that makes sense...lol.<br />other than the smaller sizing these are great! i love the fold over portion- very nice detail. im going to get a couple more pairs in different colors (i got the black pants with grey fold over).<br />they are a tad long so shorter people like me will have to fold the bottoms over (or take them in).<br />they got to me quickly through amazon prime. son loves wearing these.  they are soft and just as i expected. i love these pants and would wear them all the time if i could. cozy, lightweight, plenty long (i\\'m tall), and very comfortable for a pregnant belly. great pants! very comfortable, they move easily and don\\'t bunch uncomfortably. thin and light, but definitely not flimsy. i must assume that all the complaints from people saying they tore must not have been paying much attention. there are a lot of hanging loops (they\\'re bondage pants, this is to be expected), so if you\\'re not careful you can snag them pretty easily. however, if you are aware of your surroundings and make sure you\\'re not stuck on a chair or in a door before standing or walking away, it should be fine.<br /><br />also, i\\'m pretty short (5\\'5\\\\\\\\\") and was worried that they\\'d be too long. they fit just fine; yes, they do drag about the last 1.5\\\\\\\\\" of hem, but again, this is sort of expected. these are definitely the sort of pants made to be worn with boots, which would make them just the right length.<br /><br />they\\'re a little expensive, but not more more than \\\\\\\\\"nice\\\\\\\\\" jeans, really, and they\\'re definitely a lot more comfortable and eye-catching.<br /><br />definitely wash alone the first time, though! they do bleed a little bit. managed to turn some socks and my fiance\\'s shirt pinkish. great product for the price.  my son is 9; fit perfectly and they keep him warm during outdoor soccer practice. i like adding a bit of edge to my outfits, and these leggings definitely do the job. they don\\'t look as expensive as they do in the photos, but i wouldn\\'t say they look cheap either (they do feel cheap, but for the price i couldn\\'t complain). they fit just fine, i\\'d say they\\'re pretty true to size, and they are plenty long (i\\'m 5\\'9&#34;). i\\'m very pleased with this purchase. they fit just like the size chart said they would. good quality. image is clear and looks good on . good quality fabric, well constructed.  consider the larger size if you are at the top of a size range.<br /><br />only &#34;problem&#34; is that the photos (supplied by manufacturer) are inaccurate. the length is above the ankle (not the burgundy photo). the front rise is lower than shown and the rear is higher. very nice quality pajama pants.  the color sent was blue black white and looks great!! will purchase some more of these in future they are really soft and fit nice! my girlfriend loves these in the mineral wash black. we also picked up the navy blue one and they aren\\'t a mineral wash which i guess i should\\'ve known but was disappointing. anyhow actually love them in a large for pajamas because they don\\'t ride up like baggy man pajamas. beautiful. at the beginning i thought it would come with the veil because of the picture, but all is fine and fit as expected, my friends liked it a lot! so comfortable and soft. :) this product is pretty much what i was expecting, except for the fit.  they hold one pee very well, even a big pee after a nap.  the fit could be better.  they are a bit snug, and i was expecting them to have a little more give, especially since my son is less than 19 pounds and they are for 19-24 pounds.  i hope his legs and tush don\\'t get any bigger in the next six months or so or else they won\\'t fit.  i have to yank them up in the back, too, or else his little plumber butt shows.  but as far as functionality goes, they work.  they are a good deal for the price. very comfortable! fits just slightly long on me but beside that a great product. it also shipped very quickly. it has not shrunk much, if at all, after washing it a couple times, so buy which ever size the chart says will fit you. i would recommend this to anyone. fits twin four years olds perfectly...and they can probably get another year because they are long after reading the few reviews on this product i wasn\\'t sure about ordering. then i figured that for the price it was worth giving them a go. i am so happy i did! i love these pjs. they fit perfectly and haven\\'t shrunk yet after 2 washes. i even put them in the dryer along with everything else (this is very important to me as i hate having to treat clothes separately). they are really warm so def not for the summer. lastly, they are really soft and comfy. the elastic is not tight but i still don\\'t even need to tie them to stay up. in summary, if you have any doubts about getting these, just do it! this is my first time i\\'ve ever purchased pants online. in the local stores i couldn\\'t find my size, so i decided to give it a try.<br /><br />i\\'m impressed by the fit and finish of these pants. they are stiff but comfortable. they do not wrinkle and out of the box i was able to wear them. ample pockets with velcro closures are quite useful. there is a metal ring in front which is perfect to attach a carabiner for keys (though having it on the side does minimize key swing when you walk). it also shipped with a web belt which was a bonus. not a very heavy belt, but by itself the belt is $8. comfortable pant and look nice... totally recommended as a college student, i recently went on a yoga pants splurge, as that\\'s the primary clothing that i wear around campus (and to my yoga classes of course!) anyway, i allowed myself to buy one expensive pair, and this was that pair (i know it\\'s not that much of a splurge, but hey, college budget). these are great yoga pants! i do agree with the reviews that said these fit a bit tight through the thighs. however, this is not a problem for me because my butt and legs are basically nonexistent and all other pants just make me look flat and boyish - so these are actually great for me! if you were blessed with a butt, however, size up. they\\'re also a little long, which is surprising for me because i\\'m 5&#34;7 and almost all pants are too short for me, but i don\\'t actually mind. i just hike them a little higher up my waist. i like that these are a bit more heavy weight than the others i purchased, too. very comfy, fits well, moves well with my body. have worn these pants for the last 10 years and were only available at a golds gym facility who only had limited size and supply, now thanks to amazon theyre 1 click away authentic, quick shipment and fairly priced. to this day they are the most stylish comfortable pants out there not like the baggy ones without pockets.<br />definitely a step above the rest. my daughter, a horse lover and owner, put these pajama pants on her christmas wish list and was extremely excited to receive them as one of her gifts! love it love it love it. i wear them with my gryffindor scarf and it\\'s a perfect match. they are loose hanging and light and comfy and, of course, super nerdy. which rocks. what i did not realize when my wife asked me to purchase these for walking the dogs during the cold maryland winters is they are actually ski pants that i use to purchase years ago for over a hundred dollars.  the price and quality are great and the bottom of the leg velcros  to make them tight to your legs so you don\\'t walk on the pants when not wearing ski boots. the boys like how these pants fit. they are very comfy too. cheap material, super thin, you get what you pay for<br />they do the job though<br />good deal for the price so upset might work for u though these pants were very comfortable.  i wore them all day at a renaissance festival with no issues. love it some people have complaineded about the pants look, these aren\\'t fashion they are &#34;rain pants&#34; used them within days of receiving them and they work great, i took them off after a rainy seg way ride home  and was dry, mission accomplished. these fit my husband really well and he says they\\'re comfy! bought this for a g.i. joe costume i\\'m putting together.  matches everything else and fits perfectly!  will definitely buy from again! great color, quality, and fit! i love the brand. i love the fabric. i love the quality. i to put my son in these when we travel because they are so soft and breathable. they are thin so great to layer for chilly mountain or beach morning/evening when the temps can change quickly. okay . i like these pants a lot by how they fit. however, they are see through and i have to wear very specific underwear in order to wear it and not bend over all the way. these are not heavy & they tend to get knee\\'s when sitting, other than that they are good fitting. this fits just as per other reviews said--glad i read first. my child is 53 in tall(4ft 5), longer legs with that height, waist and hips are about 22-24 inches. we ordered intermediate child(ic) size. the legs are long...down to her heels, but she likes them like that(for jazz). comparing to other &#34;standard&#34; clothing, these are about a 6x-7waist/hips, but an8-10 pant length. the fabric is silky, flexible, but not cheap or too thin, and easy to stretch/do splits in. i love them so much i am going to try a large for my 5ft3in 90lb older daughter. these pants are perfect - the material is nice (almost silky), fit is perfect.  my only complaint is that they are a little long.  i am 5\\'5\\'\\' and always wear flats (i\\'m pregnant - hence why i\\'m wearing maternity pants). if i wore heels, they would fit perfectly, so i will either have to hem them or only wear them when i attempt to wear heels (doubtful).  other than that though - they are great.  a little stretchy and fit really well in all areas except length. i purchased these emt pants in a \\\\\\\\\"small\\\\\\\\\" size on november 2011.  i\\'m a relatively small guy in the ems field.  when they arrived, they seemed big overall, and 4 inches longer than i needed them, i\\'m 5\\'5 and 135 pounds.  you can adjust the waist with tabs on the side (like backpack straps) and trim the extra pant length (or just fold it inside).  these pants are pretty poofy/baggy on my legs so they feel like they are sagging.  i\\'m fine with that, considering these were only $30.<br /><br />there\\'s a lot of pocket room for your ems gear like stethoscope, gloves, cellphone, trauma shears, flashlight, notepad, etc.  the knees are double layered.  it\\'s been 6 months and nothing wrong with them yet after wearing them every weekday.<br /><br />update: \\\\\\\\\"small-short\\\\\\\\\" is 3 inches shorter on the pant leg if the \\\\\\\\\"small\\\\\\\\\" is too long for you. great! i have been planning on getting a pair and always put it off. i got them and love em. sooo comfortable. great price!!!!! my daughter is 5\\'3&#34; and 99 pounds, finally some pants that fit! these fit nicely in the hips, just a little loose in the waist but not enough to need a belt. she likes that she can bend over in these without feeling a breeze down her pants! the length is a tad long so she had room to grow. love these! cute i am 5\\'10\\' and a lean 160#\\'s, and continually have issues finding clothing that is cut correctly.  these are very simple, breathable/soft fabric, and cut correctly for maximum comfort.  i\\'ve had them for over a year now, and they have held up extremely well.  minimal shrinkage/wear.  simple design and material done very well. these are very snug pants in the seat and thigh area. i\\'m 5\\'2 and weigh abt 107# and i\\'m glad i took the advice of other reviewers and ordered a size larger than i usually wear! i\\'m normally a small but ordered medium and they fit but still a little snug, so going up two sizes might have been a better option. they are also &#34;low-riders&#34;... not much space between the waistband and the crotch so beware if you\\'re looking for something roomy! they are really cute on, though, so i\\'m glad i purchased them. i wanted something that was less expensive than the usual 5.11. while that brand is good it\\'s wildly overrated. then you have the other brands like proper, black hawk, and truspec. if you want something that looked at all of the pluses of those brands and combined them into one product - you have condor tactical.<br />i counted over 20 pockets on the pair i ordered. the front pockets are wide and deep making it easy for me to reach around my gear and into the pocket without contorting my wrist, or fingers.<br />the cargo pockets are well placed, easy to reach into, and deep enough to hold what i need.<br />comfort: more comfortable than the 5.11\\'s or proper\\'s i usually wear. not sure how as they use the same material, but these feel cooler in the hot, moist environment i work in.<br />if you want a less expensive (but not cheap) alternative to the big name tac pant brands, along with the their advantages - get condor. they fit nicely for what i paid. the sides fray a little but they looked cute under a grey sweater dress this has a good color and apparience, cheap and comfort. this item is good in outdoors events and office, enjoy! these pants must be the nicest pair of pants i\\'ve ever owned.<br /><br />amazon.com might say i didn\\'t order these through here; that\\'s because i privately contacted the seller and switched to these over the 63/35 version.<br /><br />anyway, these pants are very solidly constructed. they\\'re actually a bit heavy, and thick too. i started sweating as soon as i put them on, heh. this is not a bad thing though, as this means they will make excellent pants for the cold weather here in new england. no need to buy any under armour leggings to go under these ;)<br /><br />they also have tons of pockets. the knife pockets are a nice touch, but i do wish they were a little deeper and thicker. if i needed to get my pocket knife out in a hurry for self-defense i wouldn\\'t really be able to. the two large pockets on the front for ar-15 mags should please shooters and military personnel. i don\\'t own an ar-15 (yet), so i just use the dividers to store various things like my cell phone.<br /><br />all in all i couldn\\'t be happier. i\\'m not new to tactical pants, as i bought two different pairs of 5.11 tactical pants in the past. these put those pants to absolute shame.<br /><br />i\\'m not really up-to-date on what the military is allowed to wear, but if you\\'re in the military or police i imagine these are the best tactical pants you\\'re going to find. like most people, i was a bit hesitant buying a suit online, but i thought for the price i would give it a risk. it was definitely worthwhile. i have a few suits that i have spent a lot more money to buy, but this one is my favourite. it fits beautifully, the fabric is unbelievably soft, and it looks fantastic. every time i wear this suit i get good comments. it has been about a year since i got it and it looks the same as the day it arrived, so it will last. these pants are awesome. i wear them for kickball.  fit great, they are comfy, and do not itch.  now the teams salute to my pants. these are just like they are in the picture. i will say, i bought a large thinking they were sized for juniors, but they seem to me like they are misses sizes. i am sure i could have been comfortable in a medium, these are a bit bigger than i hoped, and i had hoped for them to be baggy and loose, this is just a bit too much around the waist.<br /><br />i may get another :) cheap, looks fine, not bad at all i liked, i loved very much this product.  it\\'s perfect to my baby:) every body said  where ere you buy this cloth. thanks for everything the pants are comfortable to wear, but a little short. i am medium height,5/4 1/2\\\\\\\\\". my grandson looks adorable in these. the fit is good and they seem to be good quality. love them i ordered these baby pants for my 16 month old baby. i ordered 24 months size so that i can use them little later. the order came as expected on time, with decent fabric quality. i think it\\'s a good buy. the fold over yoga/pilates pants fit me so well.  i am 5\\'3&#34; an did shorten them about 4 inches, but it was worth it.  the pants fit very well and are extremely comfortable.  they form fit to the body but that is what you want if you are doing pilates or yoga.  i am extremely happy with these pants. i wear a size 8 pants and ordered the medium.  true medium size... well constructed.  baggy - just like the photo.  i\\'ve worn them both with a camisole or a baggy shirt like in the photo.  i\\'m 5\\'7\\\\\\\\\" and 155lbs and the fit is good...it seems to hide my beer paunch.  yes!  the only issue is that i\\'ve washed them 4 or 5 times now and the cotton looks like they\\'re already starting to pill.  i\\'m going to start washing them inside out on gentle cycle and hanging to dry.<br /><br />anyway, great pants at an affordable price. i ordered another style/print that is no longer avail but love love these pants.  because they are no longer avail i could not write a review.  i contacted the seller sohogirl who got back to me immediately to let me know that they would be adding more styles today.  so here i am... i ordered this style and am confident i will love them.  i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; and i will expect these to be too long as were my other pair but nothing an easy hem can\\'t solve.  because they are too long is the only reason why i rate it a 4.  material fits fab, too! very comfortable, true to size, good material and color worth the money . . . . . . . . my daughter loves them! when i pulled the pants out of the bag i thought there is no way i am fitting these things but still decided to torture myself and try them on and i was glad i did. they fit well and are a strong material. i ordered a size 15 when i normally wear a woman\\'s 10 or juniors 11 and the fit good. i really like like gray color also. i have a special need daughter  7 years old still not potty trained  work well for day time use. i love these. i really want to wear these in public but feel like they are too much.... i wish the crotch had less fabric. i look 2 tons. lots of room for a toddler to grow, keeps the wearer dry. helps cut down chill from breeze/wind. very big on smaller children. i have been stalking these pants for a while, reading reviews and comparing to other sellers\\' products.  finally made the purchase and followed suggestions to order a size down.  i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; and normally a 17, so i ordered a 16.  they are extremely stretchy with a little too much extra fabric around the groin/hip area - which says a lot coming from me with my big butt and hips - and as you wear them throughout the day they sag even more.  not cute for skinnies!  they are also very long, so much so that just bunching them at the ankles doesn\\'t suffice, i had to fold up a few times.  with all that being said, i still love these pants and will try my best to shrink \\'em.  my suggestion would be to maybe order 2 sizes down, which is what i\\'m about to do.<br /><br />summary -  totally worth trying 1 to 2 sizes smaller.  they are so soft, i feel like i\\'m wearing jammies to work.... but still getting compliments! great fit and the adjustable hem with velcro worked great as well. love them i really like it is constable to exercise and you can even use it to work or as dress pants. these pants fit at the selected measurements unlike others that do not come close to the size they indicate. they are comfortable and the cargo pockets are easy to use. i was a little worried about the fit because i am petite frame and only 5 foot  but it fits perfectly and it looks great! . i read that some people felt these were not in fact short, but they are. i am 5\\' 4\\\\\\\\\" (average height) and they just reach my ankle. perhaps some people like them that length, but when it comes to workout pants, i need them to at least cover part of my shoes. i normally wear a 6 or 4 in women\\'s pants and i got a medium. i like that they are fitted through the knees. they and not too short (i\\'m 5\\'7&#34;). other reviews seemed to say they were thin and see through, but the black ones i got don\\'t seem thin at all. they seem stretchy but sturdy. they remind me of a pair of american apparel yoga pants that i\\'ve had for several years. good price and materials quality. very comfy! they are very light and appear to be rainproof while very flexible and loose fitting...i love them!!!!!!!!!! they fit perfectly. love these! so soft and cozy! so comfortable! i\\'m 5\\'9&#34; and 160lbs and got a size large. they fit very well and move with me nicely. only reason they only get 4 stars is because they are wearing out at the inner thigh a little faster than i they should be. daughter loves them! i\\'m 5\\'1 and about 3 inches of these pants hang below my feet. they\\'re super cute and comfy, but i certainly won\\'t be wearing them outside much. very comfortable, great fit. i took them with me on my business trip to slc and wore them the third day i was there and even though the temperature was minus 1 i was still comfortable in them. yoga pants are super tight but, are cute and comfortable. i bought two pairs and glad i did. thank you! great pair of lightweight summer pants.  the waist size seemed a little bigger than 38, but it has a drawstring which cinches it up nice.  to compensate, the pants length appears longer than 32, which is good for me. love them, all except that i wish they were lower cut... but hey they\\'re still beautiful and pretty friggin sweet :) when i first got the yoga pants, they fit perfectly. they are extremely comfortable and durable. however, after a certain amount of washes, they do shrink so now i have to really stretch them out before i put them on. for anyone who is thinking about purchasing these: you should! but i would reccomend getting them one size up from your normal size because of the shrinking that will occur. overall a good product. in 15 and was worried about getting the &#34;one size fits all&#34; spiel but was pleasantly surprised when i got it in the mail and it rlly did fit ! so relieved husband says : perfect, light, easy to move in. soft comfortable fabric. great for gym, for people who really work out. i love the pants, the fit, the color band.  now if i could just find a matching color tee shirt. loved this item; however as you wear it,  it seems to loosen up. it has a draw string to help you compensate for that but i wonder if i could have used a smaller size?  i have worn this several times and enjoy the comfort. excellent quality and fit great! i am very happy with this purchase!!!!!!!! i love these pants but after a few months the top has stretched so i have to wear with a belt. not ideal for yoga pants but they are so comfortable. they are great for p.j.s i ordered these for my 11 year old son. i read the previous reviews and ordered twice the size he needed. they are slightly too big but will give him longer wear out of them. maybe the sizes have been adjusted???? brilliant quality. well worth the money!!! i absolutely love these yoga pants and plan on buying more. they do tend to run slightly small but probably not enough where you need to go up a size. they fit extremely well and are very flattering. the pants hug the legs nicely without exposing any flaws and finish out at a cute flair at the feet. i am not sure about the other colors but with black the fabric is nice and sturdy so nothing will show through and embarrass you. whether you buy these for yoga or just to look good you will not be disappointed. highly recommend. great price, too. i absolute love these!! they are so comfortable and they look really good. super love these but they are very long so they need hemmed. great for a casual or even a nice dressy look with a dressy top. you need to be bold to wear these because they are very unique, but i love them. the only downside is, they\\'re one size fits all. so if you\\'re bigger like me, they will be tight in the waist even though they\\'re stretchy. i just wear a loose top with it and it totally works. bought as a gift for my son.  he likes them. they are comfortable. i ordered medium. i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; and 145lbs. they\\'re long but fit great. she liked it alot good for playing bought this for my hubby and he loves it! fits as expected and shipped fast my son looked good in the pants though he outgrew them really quickly. thin material but i like them, they are long enough and im 5\\' 10. i did order xl for the length assuming that would give them that extra inch. received item today even though i waited until the last minute to order. great looking tee that will make a great christmas gift for my \\\\\\\\\"psycho\\\\\\\\\" sister. thanks for the quick turnaround! reading the other reviews of this item helped me to decide on which sizes to order.  i didn\\'t think i was an extra small until i saw that some reviewers put in height and weight and said that these are men\\'s sizes.  i am 5\\' 2&#34; and weigh about 115 lbs and the extra small is roomy and comfortable. these are nice, but they do fit a bit in the hips and butt area.  i thought they where a full loose fit, but they are a little form fitting. this was a gift for my mother and she loves it. when you are pregnant it\\'s all about being comfortable.  i bought these as a gift for my daughter.  appears i will be purchasing some more! these are the most comfortable pj bottoms i\\'ve ever owned. if you\\'re thinking about getting these, do it. if i could live in these things, i would! this item is wonderful. they fit great and look just as wonderful as they feel. the price was just right. thank you my son loves these pants!  he says they\\'re really soft & super comfy!  i highly recommend them! bought small but its still big for me. i\\'m 5\\'1 in height. its a nice pants though. soft and nice type of cloth. these are great. i just wish they had more sizes available in all the types. i would get one of each. nice material, heavier than normal legging.  low cut waist.  medium is good for size 6 so sizing is small.  good value. perfect these are breathtaking. the stained glass look is beautiful. i recommend these to anyone collecting leggings with great quality at a great price. they got here fast too! pros:<br />-good for the price<br />-tear resistant*<br />-water resistant* but breathable material<br />-wind resistant<br />-dries fast<br />-feels durable<br />-teflon coating<br />-many pockets that are deep<br />-color is black as described, not some random other color not matching the pictured item<br />-comes with a belt<br />-inner button in addition to the zipper and snap on button that\\'s normally there<br /><br />cons:<br />-*i said water resistant before but that really depends on some factors. for several drops of water travelling quickly directly toward the pants, yeah most will be deflected right off, but i\\'d eyeball it and say about 5-10% of all water that comes in contact gets absorbed. that was a little disappointing. there is a tradeoff to this shortfall which makes them worth it: material seems breathable, yet not so breathable that wind would ever become a serious issue anywhere there\\'s weak to moderate wind.<br />-teflon is chemically inert to most chemicals, but to those for which it is reactive, it\\'s got no hope. easily damaged by certain chemicals.<br />-*wouldn\\'t want to expose these pants to rough conditions purposely even if i do think they might hold up. they seem tear resistant but not tear proof. strong, but not impenetrable. as stated, good for the price. yes, these pants are so comfortable and my daughter really likes hers.  she prefers to order them on-line cuz you can get much better deals.  there was prompt delivery also. so soft and great fit. wear these almost every day. love these pants. will be buying again. shipped as expected. fit very good. i actually ordered another one because i liked it  so much, then cancelled the extra one until i could actually try it on when the cuffs were done.<br />however, only one issue is that the zipper seems to catch and stop about 3/4 way up. but not always, just sometimes.  i just wonder if it will eventually stop completely.<br />however, because the pants fit so well, it overcomes any zipper issue at this time. i love these,  it is my second pair,  very forgiving to your flaws,  probably too large if you are less than size 6 or larger than a 16. great fabric,  excellent summer or vacation relaxed or dressed up! too big dor me i love these! i was skeptical about the free size as i\\'m on the small side but they\\'re perfectly flattering and extremely comfortable so i got two more in different colors. a lot of khakis are out there, and most are sold just to be stylish..not that this is bad, but why limit everyday wear just sold for looks when you can have style that\\'s long lasting and durable all in one? that\\'s the duality of these dickies khaki work pants. stylish good fit, and made to take a licking, if it\\'s needed. way to go dickies! i even play golf in mine. these pants are fabulous!  i had them hemmed to length.  the fit is great and the fabric is so smooth and light it is like wearing nothing.  i have had other women compliment these pants.  try them you will like them. nice looking pants and wash very well. these are soft and warm and very cute! unlike some other reviews, i feel like the size is spot on! i wear a size 10 and would normally order a medium, but ordered up due to reviews. wish i had bought the medium! hapoy anyway and will not be returning them. material is great, nice and stretchy. fits nicely... will definitely but other colors like these palazzos but they are not for tall women.<br />i am 5\\'5&#34; and the length is perfect.  they do grow as you wear and i had to make tucks on the waist band.<br />i am a size 6/8 and i bought medium, probably should have ordered small but i didn\\'t want them tight.<br />the tighter they are the more see-through because the material is thin. good fit comfortable great for exercise and running long black with a stripe and stirrups that fit good and nice these yoga pants were all i expected them to be‚Ä¶.true to size and very nice quality! i\\'ve bought several pair since! i do like these pants. i think that they fit well. the first order i made was size large.  i ware a bigger size right now in pants because i gained a little weight and size large was too big.  i did think that was a little off, but when it comes to yoga pants i have noticed i tend to ware size medium, which are the replacement i ordered in the black color.  so far i have wore the pants twice and they are serving their purpose well. soft and beautiful. these are wonderful pants. i have four pair of these in different colors. mine have held up very well. they are long but i like mine that way. i am 5\\'5&#34; and 160lbs. the small fit perfect. if you have a problem with them falling down you might want to go down a size. i wear mine with rayon t-shirts and a cami underneath. topped off with yoga sandals and this makes for really cute outfits. i hope this helps. oh , the cami under a shirt helps keep the waist band wear you want it. ordered a size up - great fit and very sexy.  love the low rise cut. great price, cute product, very well done. kinda shiny. fits well ( i\\'m tiny). love the colors and the material. fits my lo just fine and will for a little bit longer. i also like the ankle cuff cut, because it holds socks in place. order more in different colors and sizes. comfortable pants. i did notice after just a few weeks of wearing it, it\\'s wearing out in the inner thigh area. i don\\'t think these will last too long but are good enough. never needed to return this item  the rating should never be based on the policy  only on the item very cute but small great fit i bought the ones in black they fit nice. just the length i was looking for.will be getting another pair. i absolutely love them, exceeded my expectations and was a reasonable price. i will definitely be purchasing another pair in the near future. so cute great white shorts for work or casual wear. what more can you say about white shorts? they\\'re functional go with everything. i really like the fit and look of these pants.  one great thing is that because they are high on the waist, there\\'s no skin hanging over the sides and they are slimming.  they look good with t-shirts, tanks and corsets. i love the material; they\\'re very easy to move around in.<br /><br />my only problem was the size. they\\'re supposedly one size fits all. ladies, if you have a butt, these will not fit you. i am about 5\\'6&#34;, 140lbs, and i have a big butt. these barely go over my butt. they\\'re more like boyshort undies. i still wear them to workout in the privacy of my own home, but i wouldn\\'t dare wear these in public. now if you are petite, they\\'re perfect for you! i like it super soft! perfect for baby! i always have at least one pair of these in our pajama rotation.  i love them because they are incredibly soft and stretchy, so they can be worn for a while while my son grows.  they are cool enough for summer nights and still somehow warm enough for cool nights.    these make a great gift at baby showers as well.  they are a little pricey so it\\'s kind of a luxury item to have or give.  they fit true to size.  also, don\\'t dry these with heat or it makes them look kind of worn. my daughter wears these pants all of the time. they wash and wear well and are super cozy! these &#34;jogger pants&#34; are a wonderful addition to my wardrobe. they\\'re super soft and very comfortable. they fit almost like leggings or jeggings, but they have a draw string waist, which i like a lot. they\\'re much more stylish than &#34;old style&#34; jogging pants or sweat pants. i like the fashionable straight leg/skinny fit very much. they can definitely be worn when exercising or jogging, but they can also be worn with a cute tunic or big sweater and ankle boots to create a perfect comfy but cute look to wear for casual dates or parties. pair them with a favorite t-shirt and flip flops or sneakers, for a cute outfit to wear when running errands, buying groceries, etc. they\\'re wonderfully versital! if you prefer a loose fit, order one size larger than you normally wear, because they\\'re definitely form fitting. i ordered a size large because i personally prefer a slightly larger size when wearing jogging type pants, and they fit me, but there\\'s not any room to grow, at all. i won\\'t ever wash them in warm or hot water or put them in the dryer, because if they shrink even a little bit, they\\'ll be too small. other than that, they\\'re close to perfect, i\\'m very pleased with them, and i would love to have several pairs in different colors!<br /><br />*i purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. i am 5\\'1 and weigh 130 lbs i read previous reviews so decided to order it in a large (usually fit s/m) and it fit perfect. color are even brighter and prettier in person absolutely lived it! my 13 year old grandson loved the pants and is very happy with them the inside hidden panels are wonderful, a full slimming garment underneath.  now you don\\'t have to buy a pair of spanx to fit into them, they are there already.  i am a petite size 4; they fit according to size and just the length will need to be shortened.  the tweed is a nice weight for a summer weight and the pants are nice enough for the office or dressed up for evening.  the waist sits about two inches higher than my own and make a wonderful long line when worn with heels my legs look oh so much longer! i\\'m really short. so the legs were really long, and i rolled them up 3 times but they are really good. love it! excellent these are some of my favorite pajama pants. very warm and soft. but not heavy and uncomfortable. i absolutely love these yoga pants! i got the black & white ones size medium & they fit perfect. i normally wear a size 7, i am 5\\'5\\\\\\\\\" & 125lbs. since i liked these so much i decided to try the same pants but the legging instead & those were pretty thin & almost completely see through :-\\\\ they are great and laundry just perfectly my 2yr old grandson noah will love wearing these peppa pig pants!  made nice! you\\'ll love them too! received package within two days and they are perfect they fit perfectly and are very comfortable. they fit as expected, which it to say they fit perfectly around my waist, but are a little too loose in the legs.  no big deal to me though, still very comfortable and worth the money. love the pants,  would like to order more.<br />please send emails of more that\\'s in the same price range for me to look at. it may be large but i love the pants so much maybe you should me other one for free? (: these pants have a nice thin waistband, they are light and breathable, and the fabric is soft and stretchy. they are a bit big for my 12 week old (mainly too long), but he should be able to wear them a while. i love this brand. great price, and my husband loves them. he\\'s 5 \\'11 and weighs about 215. he made me order another pair even. they\\'re very comfortable and oh-so-soft. i missed the part where it says they\\'re long (oops!), i\\'m gonna have to hem them, haha. and i love the wide waistband. so often my problem with bottoms is the waistband digging in between my stomach rolls. that won\\'t be a problem with these. pants fit great, very comfortable. i have another pair of these from dockers and love them. my favorite pants to wear! they fit well and look nice!  they do the job! my boyfriend loves them so &#34;one size&#34; does not mean &#34;one size fits all&#34; because if you\\'re normally a medium or above, these will be snug or cut off the circulation to your lower extremities. they are beautiful, and i still like them, but i\\'m a little disappointed in how right they are. oh well, i could stand to lose 5 lbs anyway.<br /><br />other than the fit, the fabric is definitely dyed, so be super careful when washing, that you immediately remove it from the washer or you will stain other garments it comes in contact with. i spent the better part of an hour soaking, rinsing, and squeezing blue water from these pants as well as one of my favorite white shirts (which is fine now), and even after i gave up on scrubbing them till the water coming out clear, i hung them to dry, and there is still a bit of blue on the beautiful white circle. you\\'re better off just hand-washing these in the sink with cold cold water and a little bit of detergent.<br /><br />i guess it\\'s a good thing i got these for pajamas anyway. for my teenager they absolutely love them and everyone tells them how cool they are overall they are made really well no complaints love it! good fit, comfy fabric like it a lot i love the fit. they fit just the way i wanted them to,but we\\'re way too short. i was so happy to find pants that showed a 33inch inseam. i ordered navy and black. the black fit perfect and we\\'re long enough. i was really disappointedinthe navy. perfect pants! i ordered for my wife and she likes them.  very comfortable and look great too.  fabric is good, more cotton like than other yoga pants but good quality. my wife is a calendar girl on the 2015 beauties 4 veterans calendar and needed camos; hard to fit a size 2.  she looks great in these! these yoga pants are very comfortable. i love the way they fit and they\\'re very breathable and perfect for exercise, or even just lounging around. the only thing i dislike about these yoga pants is that i wear a size small and at 5\\'7&#34; they fit slightly short on me. cute! colors very vibrant. true to size. these are not the thin leggings. they are thick. seem sturdy but very soft. no fleece liner that sometimes make them seem too hot. fit great! i love them. they fit great. came early. i\\'m gonna do a fitness shoot in them just for the fun of it fit perfectly and we\\'re comfortable! my daughter really likes this item. the quality is great and stylish. she couldn\\'t wait to try them on and put on instagram. very good quality, nice cut. will order again. life saver!!! simply put, these training pants work! my son is 3 1/2, and we\\'ve been trying to get him permanently out of diapers for the past few months with now headway. personally, today\\'s modern diapers are great, but they are too good; children cannot even tell if they are wet. added to the fact that my son would just not go #2 on the potty, we had to find another solution.    enter these training pants. i was told by a friend on facebook to try these, and in one week\\'s time my son was fully trained on the potty. he had two accidents in the first two days while wearing the training pants, which was a bit messy. however, he learned his lesson quickly, and quickly became a potty master. he\\'s also very proud of himself, that he can wear \\\\\\\\\"big boy underwear\\\\\\\\\".    we still put a pull-up diaper on him at night, just in case, but his nighttime diaper has been dry for two weeks straight. we\\'re just about ready to move him to 100% training underwear!    goodbye diapers! the fit is great for junior sizes. i usually wear a small size in missy sizes but here i needed to order size medium. the fabric is cotton and the flare looks fantastic. washing does not change the fabric and the size of the pants great color and great fit.  love \\'em. i loove these!  so comfy! my son loves them. this fits well my wife just like it and i appreciate your help...she just loved this really good pants...will continue to shop as soon as i can the clothes are in great condition. however, while the bodysuits seem to be in the right size, he pants are extremely long. i compared them with some of my older daughter\\'s 0-3 pants and they were almost twice as long.<br /><br />the tag says 0-3. i\\'m not sure if it\\'s a mistake or if these pants always run big. great product i had ordered the pants for myself, 5\\'6, female. i did not realize these to be guys\\' pants given the available color choices -even though the featured models are male... prior to ordering, i checked the sizing chart, the women\\'s, of course. assuming some shrinkage after washing, i ordered the size medium.<br />the pants are of amazing quality and will last for a long time. i\\'ll keep them as a present for someone who\\'ll most definitely appreciate them. i\\'ll be ordering a pair for myself once my size is available.<br />customer service was excellent, the delivery as fast as could be. theyre so comfortable. i am super sensitive about waist lines but i was impressed by these because when i put them on they felt fight going around my big booty and then at my waist felt just right, so they fit firm around my thighs and butt and my waist but they dont uncomfortably squuze my belly which gets bloated sometimes. i am 5&#34;4 and i weigh 105 so i bought the small and was nervous i should get the medium to be more comfy but i got the small because i didnt want them to be too long on me. im super petite. they wrap around under my heels when i walk and fscrunch up a little at the bottom but its not bad and they kind of elongate my legs. they make my butt look super sexy. the fold over is nice and firm its not all loose so you dont have to redo it a billion times. the hems and stitching seems good quality along with the print. havent washed them yet but well see how they do, i have faith in them lasting a long time. i really dig the little red t patch it calls attention to just the right place and makes them look like high quality pants. ;) received on time.. looks great! they are good quality, but you should probably order a size smaller than you think you need. i got a large one as i am quite tall and not thin (nor overweight, but definitely not thin). anyway i found that they don\\'t fall off if i\\'m just walking around, but one good tug from anyone and your rear will be showing. i think that would have been remedied by getting a size down. they are quite long which i like and look enough like pants that i do not feel ashamed to wear them to school on those days where i just don\\'t feel like getting into jeans. these were bought as a gift for my best friend. she is a massive whovian and absolutely loved them! the fit just the way she likes and arrived very quickly and were in great shape! i would highly recomend this product for anyone that loves doctor who or has a best friend that does. great pants wife like them and the look great we have both the gerber and a set of these.  they fit just fine on my almost 3 yr old son and he loves them.  he has no problem pulling them up or down.  the elastic didnt seem too tight (ie, not leaving any marks) and they appear to fit him just fine around his legs, but it may vary from kid to kid.  they\\'re really soft, especially after the first couple of washes.  we had no issues getting messes out, but we\\'re also good about scrubbing and soaking right away.  we just used a couple squirts of spray\\'n\\'wash and rubbed anything out.  very easy to care for.  our son is about 37 lbs so we got size 4. great product, very happy, soft material, excited to get different colors these run small ... i normally wear a small but bought  l/xl according to the size chart and they fit perfect i just love these. everyone remarks how cute and vintage they look with the flap back. these are adorable and very comfy. not sure why people had issues with size they fit me perfect and i got a small wear a size 2 normally. very comfortable, very pleased very satisfied with the product and service and my wife loves it thanks. .. nice and roomy! i bought these for my (99th weight percentile) baby when he was a few weeks old. they fit him (loosely) then and he still wears them now, and he\\'s 12 months old. good &#34;around the house&#34; pants. fits way great my fav brand.  would love more tight leggings style and shorts, same waist, same fabric, love love would buy every color.  doesn\\'t hold pet hair and fits exactly the same after washing.  cant beat em. you cant go wrong , my daughter love love love these leggings. super cute and they fit well ,these are good ones ladies got this for my neice-to cute! i love these pants.  my daughter got about six months wear out of the pink/grey set b/c the sizing is very forgiving.  and, the pink went with some of her carter\\'s brand tops. my little brother really liked these. fits well and i love the fabric but i\\'ve only worn them three times and they are loosing ther color fits fine, soft and washes well, but i hang dry my shirts so.... nice best pants i have found for our daughter. they fit great in the diaper area and are long enough for her very long legs! i\\'m in love with these!!! i wish the legs were a little longer, but i expected that because my legs are long. i\\'m 5\\'5 140lbs with a short torso and long legs, all in my hips and these fit so dang well!! i love these!!! ps usually i buy anywhere between a us sz9 and can rarely fit a 7.. but im glad i sized down for a 7 instead of sizing up for an 11! great fit good quality fabric good value. got it in time and it\\'s really cute. you just have to be confident enough to wear it because it does show a lot of skin.<br />i love it. the material is a little cheap and it can double as a bathing suit, but it looks really good if you can accessorize. i l oooove them. i want them in every color. i bought these for a mud run team, wanted them for the guys & girls but could only find women sizes.  they were all in their early 20s, and at first thought they\\'d be too small/tight, but alas, they all wore them and after the mud, they actually liked that the mud slid right off and the shiny blue fabric looked great in all their muddy pictures.  they looked pretty cute, and i am happy with the purchase. ordered a small fits boys size 6-7.  my boy is tall and slender and the pants fit as we expected. not willing to give a 5 star yet as we have not tested the wear, slide,scrub and wash routine yet. nice fit & flattering these pants are a lot of fun. no problems thanks i bought these pants to wear for pirate night on a cruise.  the pants fit perfectly and looked great!  the were comfortable and light weight.  they packed well and did not wrinkle. i love it, fit well. it is so comfortable too! i just love them they fit and they work great on my 3 yr old son and i use them all the time would say buy them and you will see !!! the pants are very comfortable and fit perfectly. i love the pickets. i love these heavy materials pants it\\'s just that they are so small.  im about a size 8 and the mediums are skin tight on me.<br />nice color and length. they can even look like black jeans when wearing a longer top. first of all, i\\'m an older adult.  i bought these in order to give a gag hip-hop performance, so i\\'m not a child dancer.  i was expecting to use these once and then toss them.  but instead...let\\'s just say that they are unexpectedly super comfy!!!! i love them to wear around the house, like some people do with sweats.  i don\\'t own a single pair of sweats, so i can\\'t say which is better, but i can say these are probably much lighter.<br /><br />young people:  order your true size and then wash and dry before you wear them so that they fit just right.  otherwise, it looks like you just took a dump. so comfy,,,glad they are back in style. footie pants seem to be hard to find. these pants kept my little one\\'s feet toasty and were easy to layer over a onesie (we like the wrap style for the first few months). super soft, fit is as expected. they still fit her and she\\'s between 11 and 12 lbs. these are absolutely the best yoga pants i\\'ve found on amazon thus far. i\\'ve tried probably 10-12 different brands and now i only buy these. these fit snugly down my legs until about my upper calf and then gently flare. they\\'re quite flattering.<br /><br />they fit snugly but do start to stretch a bit after repeated wear. if your thighs rub you will eventually wear a hole in the inseam. they don\\'t seem to pill too badly but the fabric will wear thin at the stitching and eventually tear. until then though (and maybe even after if you wear them at home) you will want to live in them. great for yoga, for wearing around the house, i even wear these to work.<br /><br />i have these in multiple colors now. they all fit the same.  they are a little more snug than i\\'d like when first purchased, but after a bit of wear they become perfectly comfortable.  i have yet to have a pair that have gotten to that too stretched out point that a lot of cheaper yoga pants seem to get to. comfy, sturdy, funny,if i could wear them every day, i would! i get compliments on them. i walk the dog in them! fit great after first washing and drying. perfect for my granddaughter. have bought many items from luvable friends via amazon and we all love them. these are very comfortable.  i am 5\\'10&#34; and they are very, very long.  that is okay, better then too short.  i can always hem them up, just haven\\'t yet. i would buy these again. just enough of a flare at the bottom for me. i don\\'t like them tight all the way down. as expected these are soft and comfy and they also look really nice. our son loves them. they were a little pricey, but he is very happy with them. this is a fantastic product!  i have already ordered three sets for myself and friends.  i was highly impressed with the quality compared to the price.  i have purchased other wrap pants before for upwards of $30 and these are a deal with the two shirts included so i highly recomend! i started with the eggplant color and loved them so much i came back for the navy!  very soft fabric, washes well, color has not faded.  very nice pant for the price!  i will be on the look out for more colors.  fits true to size and does not get baggy through-out the day! love them, thanks! love the way these fit i initially purchased this romper in black not really sure what to expect, but upon arrival and my first wear to a party, i came home the same night and purchased the sapphire blue which is also beautiful!  i am a 40d and the elastic top is tight and stays in place and the material of this romper just takes it from a fun day to party.  this purchase for me was a 5 star! the pants were too big as a large, so will order a smaller size.  i will give the pants to a sister. i love these pants! they are super cute and fit better than i expected. i am a size 2 so i would highly recommend choosing the xs size up to a size 4. ha.  i didn\\'t notice that these were specifically for girls and wondered why they were pinker than i thought they\\'d be, but we live in brooklyn so don\\'t believe in gender constructs anyway :) these are great pants.  light and comfortable and super warm. extremely pleased with purchase.  the items are very comfortable; have always been pleased with this brand.  the fit is great, and i could not be happier with this purchase.<br />delivery was prompt.  i appreciate this service and also the packaging of the items.<br />many, many, many thanks got this for baby shower gift, the mom loved it! very soft and fits perfect. very we\\'ll made. had many comments on it. it\\'s really getting hard to find true training under pants these days (not the disposable pull-ups). i couldn\\'t find them any where else. these are nice with a double layer of material in the crotch. be warned though, they will not hold more than a \\'dribble\\'. but my daughter learned pretty quickly wearing these. i bought 2 packages (6 pr) and wish i had bought one more so that i didn\\'t have to wash so frequently, especially at the beginning. definitely a most buy! i was scared it wouldn\\'t fit how i wanted it too b-cuz i\\'m short and weigh a lil extra at the back. but the large worked perfectly! oh & it arrived early too :d cool item, thanks!! cute pants!! fits really well. super cheap price compared to other yoga pants. sizes do run a little small though so make sure to keep that it mind when ordering! these pants are amazing! i plan to buy a few more pairs. love the material and the length. my 13 yr old loves them. we live in the south and white is better for practice. not laundry of course, but the boy is cooler. i bought xl pants, they are now medium. these pants shrunk after about 10 washes. this was expected, i bought them a little larger for this reason. however, they were very comforatble - i used to workout in these sweats everyday during the fall and winter, and if i had to - i would re-order them in a heart beat. niceüòé these pants are super comfortable! i love them. they have a nice subtle spandex stretch. in the sunlight they show a littke bit of sheen. sizing is accurate. i will be ordering more pairs. love these jeans! i run a home based business and bought our company colors...wore them on stage in front of 10,000 people and got nothing but compliments! it works people: the lime green is perfect for our business! woot! i just bought these pants and i cant wait to wear them. i will probably wait and break them until i go to a kenny chesney concert in june. i got the xxl and the waist is a little tight but i have a good amount of room in the thighs. very well made, only thing it\\'s too thick, but it\\'s good quality. nice fitting pants, good quality. i even handed it down these pants are so soft and warm! well made also. drawstring is great for adjusting them to fit your waist.  love them! i bought two other pairs from this manufacturer and this is the only pair that actually fits my 5\\'\\'7&#34; frame. they are long enough (as in photo) and appropriately baggy. i like them.  i do not know if they will maintain their size in the wash. also, avoid pet hair and lint like the plague...they attract it like moths to a flame. overall, i am happy with this purchase. i do not think they will fit any medium sized man or larger woman, so be cognizant of that. how does dickies do it. they are both the most inexpensive maker of pants and the maker of the pants that last the longest. the double strength knee thing is even kind of stylish. i wear them in formal occasions. heh if i \\'m indetified with the working class, so be it, these are great and i\\'m a s poor as a church mouse. thanks dickies. even though there were other reviews that these were see-through, i wanted these for tye-dye. not too expensive. and came before expected.<br />i usually wear a medium anywhere. i wasn\\'t sure if they were going to run small or bigger. they are perfect! great. recommended it was recommended that you buy a size up due to the high possibility of shrinkage. i think two sizes up would have been better as they seem to run small as well. these are awesome pants. i received them very quickly and they fit perfect! i saw some reviews saying to size down so i did, and i regret nothing. they make my bum look great so comfortable i want to live in them. wife loved pants fit perfectly<br />she\\'s going to buy more in this style material is great not then and is not see thru would.<br />she would reference any women that likes this style to buy them. super comfortable, and still sophisticated looking for a night out. and i received them much earlier than expected, just in time for a vacation trip! i love these! doesnt fit completely, but either way, i love it. they are large i have to have been taken in but i do like them a lot! thank you, jayne awesome! best pj\\'s for 8 week old to wear in crib. covers hands so they don\\'t get cold since blankets aren\\'t allowed in cribs and offers easy access for diaper changes. soft and snuggle but not too hot or thick.  these are great for florida nights and winters!  to remind me of my alaskan adventures! perfect for clubbing! thank you so much i got this for my guy to wear while riding his sports bike back and forth to work. i thought it would block out the wind but it\\'s not the correct fabric to do that. he uses this under his overalls to work in and he likes them. they help keep him warm so he likes them. bought these pants following the sizing guide and they do fit true and well in the hips and butt. however, being slightly taller than average at 5\\'8, the hems are sitting higher than on the model and are rather tight. on my body they fit like capris, on a shorter lady they will probably fit true to the image. good pants for the price. these pants are perfect for my 5 year old who is does not like button-up pants. they look nice and he loves wearing them. my only complaint is that for him, they are a little on the long size - nothing a little hem adjustment won\\'t fix. great pants, but they run a little large. liked them shipped fast very comfortable pant if you are kickin\\' it around the house, doing laundry, or as pjs. i wear them around the house almost every day since i got them, and i like changing into them after work. i\\'m very high waisted in back, not so much in front, and the band around the waist takes care of this nicely. i\\'m 5\\'8&#34; and somewhat long legged, got a tall, and the length is perfect. the material feels oddly stiff, which is why i assigned four stars instead of five, but this is no big deal and may be no problem once the pants are washed. the best thing about them is they have an adequate, lined, gusset. this article has a nice, lightweight feel to it and is 100% cotton (made in india). i find it comfortable in warm weather. i do not wear it as a jumpsuit, as i bought this for comfortable lounging pants.<br /><br />i am 5\\'9&#34; (~145lbs) and generally wear a small or medium, depending on the brand. this fits well, and i love the length and excess of fabric as pants, however i find that the elastic part is quite tight. the tightness itself isn\\'t so much as the problem as much as the elastic part itself is thin, meaning that i feel like it somewhat digs into my waist (and i have a thin stomach/waistline). that said, i do not wear the elastic as high as shown in the picture. i have resorted to folding the elastic part over itself 2-4 times before resting it on my lower hips.<br /><br />enjoy! i bought three pair in different colors.  i wear a size 10 and bought the large because i was worried about them being too tight.  i think i could have gone with a medium to get them tighter in the legs, and i do wish i had bought some in the capri length.  i love the fold over top edge and they aren\\'t too tight at the top.  they are a little long but i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; so i have to take most pants up anyway.  overall these were a good buy and i\\'m very happy with them. the pants are really the same as the picture, and they fit so good! beyond that the pants was delivered so fast. i\\'m so glad i bough these shorts! nice and comfy! these are so cute, the fabric is thin but well made & really cute i loved them so much i reordered every color!!! they shipped super fast! no issues would recommend this company & this item! super comfortable and makes my body look amazing. bought these in a med at first, but ended up sending back and exchanging for a size sm. i am 5 ft 2 in and weigh 120 lbs for reference. the med was a little too loose around the knee/shin area, but the sm fit just fine. i bought these pants for my husband. i regret it now, because when he put these pants on, he turned into an eagle and flew off into the wild blue yonder.<br /><br />seriously though, the pants fit perfectly. he\\'s got short legs and the tapered legs means the cuffs don\\'t drag. the design is beautiful and the fabric is super soft. he says they\\'re the most comfortable pants he owns (and he owns a lot of comfortable pants). absolutely worth the money. this is her second pair, we also have them in camo. she likes them because they\\'re as comfortable as sweatpants but with pockets and a stronger waist. good clothesÔºÅit is suitable not only in gym but also for outside! they fit perfectly.  no complaints great work pants for multiple uses! i love the color green; perfect shade of a of a deep green without being too dark i love these pants. i am roughly 5\\'5\\\\\\\\\" and 140lbs. the medium fits me perfectly. they are somewhat long, as tripps tend to be. but with the draw-string bottoms? this is not an issue.<br /><br />the only reason this product gets four stars instead of five is because it was not exactly as pictured. the faded look of the material is much more prominent in the photo than in reality.. it honestly just looks like you wiped a bunch of stuff on the pants. not a problem for me, i like the grunge look.<br /><br />the pocket detail was all supposed to be black, along with the pants.. my pair seems to have a somewhat faded camo-like detail on the straps of the pockets. doesn\\'t look terrible, but if you\\'re expecting an exact copy of the photo? you may be slightly disappointed.<br /><br />besides that: perfect. very comfortable.. much lighter than i\\'m used to from tripp.. also, not quite as baggy as some of my previous pairs of tripp pants.. they are very ample as far as baggage, but there are a couple sets of zippers on the legs to make them less \\\\\\\\\"hammer-time\\\\\\\\\" and more \\\\\\\\\"oh, that person has two legs!\\\\\\\\\" which i am grateful for. definitely a good buy. very nice quality and comfort. fast shipping. item matched description and was delivered when expected. thank you! at first the fit was awkward,  but after wearing  twice these are definitely super comfy! the crotch seems a tad low, but not too noticeable. material is cozy but thin so it doesn\\'t get too hot wearing them. so happy with the quality and fit. my lo has a belly and is short.  i have to roll the pants, but the shirt and waist band are a good fit.  a slight fade to the brown as it\\'s been washed a bunch. i even bought the short sleeve top. loved them but they shrunk on the first wash! i bought these pants for my grand mother and she likes them. they look great on her. my grand mother does not have a butt, but these jeans worked magic. i love the pants i just wished it was i got it a size bigger because i like baggy pants but they fit great came on time just like said i was in busted ruins from mining khakis. i got worked by the khaki market for over a year.<br />bean¬Æ\\'s are too light-wt., and eddie bauer¬Æ, pennys¬Æ, sears¬Æ, dockers¬Æ, wearguard¬Æ, produced nothing that would hold-up to a constant 65 mph headwind, riding a 1955 panhead, and not reveal the loose change and keys plastered to my leg (inside my front pockets).<br /><br />having been tortured by disappointment so often, for so long, from so many manufacturers that have gone the cheap and unstructured way, and lapsed into \\\\\\\\\"little kid\\\\\\\\\" designs [i.e; (5) belt loops instead of the normal levi¬Æ (7)], it\\'s a relief to find real khaki\\'s that remain consistently the same.<br />**********************************************<br />my first pair of bills khakis arrived and they\\'re exactly what i\\'ve been looking for.<br />the front pockets are deep have heavy weight cotton (like 1950\\'s construction).<br />the (outside) of the leg seam is flat (not rolled like levis¬Æ).<br />the interior of the waist is wide, so any belt will ride comfortably.<br />i\\'m surprised that bills 8.5 oz drill cloth is as dense. and, belt loops? yea, they\\'re narrow (good) and there\\'s (8) of them. that\\'s right ...... (8) belt holder-uppers-in-placers.<br />the khakis are abraded and enzyme washed but you can\\'t tell it. pre-shrunk by the time you get them. i\\'m going to wash and cook the khakis in the dryer before i have the legs hemmed. they fit true to size in the waist. you get what you pay for. other than the plastic leathery smell,  these leggings are super comfortable and have a very sexy fit.  i am 5\\'4&#34; and have would be considered plus size (size 12) i prefer not to lace up the sides all the way so i have breathing room.  overall i am very happy with my purchase and fast shipping too!  i am going to use these as part of my holloween costume ;-) i would recommend these as everyday wear or special occasion wear depending on how you dress them up or down.  thanks lotus style!<br /><br />--satisfied customer-- the original characters of disney are so comfortable to wear to bed.  i love the fleece and comfort of these pants.  it is great to be an adult and still wear the characters that were your favorite as a when you were a kid my baby is not born yet so i cannot comment on the size. the material is slinky, cool and seems to be an extremely comfortable outfit for a newborn to wear. i purchased this in natural peony.  the pattern is quite beautiful and different from the usual pink baby girl patterns. it arrived quickly. i cannot wait to put this on her. love!! true to size and a good length. excellent took a while for shipping. overall i receive so many compliments wearing theses pants. the tiger is drawn perfectly with true color as the picture! i have shopped around for training pants and this was a good buy. very well made and soft material, absorbent. very nice these were a gift and the girl whom i gave them to said they\\'re very comfortable and nice looking. i was worried they would have tons of static under my dress, but not at all!  perfect fit, and very light and comfortable. i wear them on their own as shorts with a long tunic, and no one would even know they were petti-pants. very light!!! will order more soon!!! perfect! light weight! love it!!!! the quality is excellent - as is the fit. i named my transplanted kidney spongebob. we celebrate his 10th birthday in june, hence the spongebob tee. a little short , once you pull them up .. but they look like jeans love these pants! i have worn them to pirate events and the local renfest and never had an issue with them! they are comfortable and airy. i ordered wrong size.... sending back, but it\\'s nice quality very cute very good fit .just right cute however not for winter/ fall in ny i never write reviews on anything, but seeing as i\\'ve purchased these pants four times, and i plan on buying more in the future, i thought i should. i\\'ll start by saying i\\'m 5\\'6&#34;, and ~180 lbs., give or take... so i do have a bit of a tummy, and the large fits me well. they\\'re true to color (i\\'ve ordered aqua-black/black-grey x2/black). they\\'re not very thick, but i live in a warm climate, so i don\\'t mind. they\\'re a good length, but the hip band is made so you can adjust the length accordingly. if i were any bigger, i would definitely be worried about stretching the fabric too thin in the butt area. my only complaint is the tag is very annoying, but i just cut all of them off. i love these pants.  they are a true 33&#34; inseam.  well-constructed of medium weight, high-quality fabric - just the right amount of give/no sag.  give me a wardrobe of these  (i\\'m thinking navy, especially).  i\\'m curious about the fitcouture pants that run more narrow in the seat that a previous reviewer mentioned.  i would like to try those. the headline says it all really~ i love these pants, especially that they are the most comfortable things to wear and still very cute! these are perfect!  they are flattering and comfy and not too long.  i am 5\\'3 and 112 pounds.  i got a size small and they are really nice.  i am going to buy more for sure...really happy i love it! this defiantly had the head turning and guys sneaking a peek that i was looking for, thanks! the main reason why i bought this outfit was because i didn\\'t like pink and it\\'s gender neutral. planning to have a boy for the next one so need to have gender neutral clothes. i knew they were going to run small.  my daughter will be five in two months, however she is small.  the pants tag actually says 4/5.  so they actually fit her pretty good. and the color said red, but its more like a dark pink. very happy for this item, very warm. it is too bad that it is sold in one size because it is a little too short. but i love it ! love these and fast shipping these were a must have when we were potty-training our son. they allowed him to feel the sensation of real underwear, but they held a little more pee in them due to the thicker lining. i\\'ll admit it.  i was the one guy that was sad when the dockers mobile pants disappeared from the market.  i didn\\'t particularly like the \\\\\\\\\"pleatedness\\\\\\\\\" of the things, but i liked the hidden pocket.  for years now, i\\'ve been going to work in pants with just your average number of pockets.  we don\\'t allow \\\\\\\\\"casual,\\\\\\\\\" so the pants with baggy pockets on the knees are out.  some afternoons, i just sit there, staring at the spot where a cargo pocket should be, hating my pants until the whistle blows to go home.<br /><br />i even tried sketching extra pockets on my khaki\\'s once...but it just wasn\\'t the same.<br /><br />then scottevest came along, and released hidden cargo pants.<br /><br />i now own two in stone and two in black.<br /><br />they\\'re great...flat front, lots of pockets, no tell-tale knee flap.  i like the zipper pocket inside on the left, so i can secure small items or \\\\\\\\\"emergency cash\\\\\\\\\" when traveling.  i love the way the pockets are double-layered, and the deep ones are separated in the middle so i can keep things from drifting around...the way the pockets are stitched together inside helps keep your pocketstuffs spaced about, so you don\\'t have unsightly \\\\\\\\\"device bulge\\\\\\\\\" from stacking too many items in the same general area of your leg.<br /><br />the only thing i don\\'t like is the drawstrings.  i often forget to tie them, then someone notices i have a random cord hanging out of my pants.  small price to pay, though, for extra hidden pockets in pants that pass for business casual.  when i wear them, i no longer feel like my pants exist only to make me uncomfortable.<br /><br />mine have been pretty durable, they\\'ve held up really well, but i do send most of my clothing to the cleaners instead of doing it at home.  mostly because i tend to shrink, bleach, or ultra-wrinkle anything i attempt to clean on my own.  take a look at the scottevest website if you want to see the \\\\\\\\\"x-ray view\\\\\\\\\" and get a better idea for the pocket layout. i\\'m very happy with this purchase.  i wasn\\'t sure i wanted to spend so much on a pair of yoga pants but i\\'m glad i did.  they are light yet sturdy.  perfect for travel. very nice pjs fit very well.. i absolutely love this.  i bought it up for an upcoming music/camping festival and i can\\'t stop wearing it!  the pockets are great, and i love that it\\'s both a one-piece and a pair of pants.  i want more in more colors! i was worried to order this but glad i did it looks great on me , i wear it for work and they look good with any nice top . and i love them. although i feel like i\\'m from the 80s when i wear them, i want to wear them every day. at first they were a bit tight around the inner thighs, but the more i wore them the more loose they got (i\\'m not sure if that\\'s good or bad.) the fit perfectly just before my ankles (i\\'m 5\\'). the only bad thing about these is that you feel everything when it is cold outside. very happy with the purchase!  fit nicely and just what he wanted! this is one great bargain, if you are looking for the coolest most comfortable wide-leg pants to wear on hot days. they look great with sandals or ballet flats. because they are so light, you might also want to wear them around the house -- that\\'s just how comfortable they are!<br /><br />however, be aware that the wonderful styles that come from newport news do tend to run small. keep that in mind, especially when you consider that you will probably run them through the dryer and they are cotton.<br /><br />they are sold in a wonderful collection of colors. this is definitely an item that i will use over and over again! have been searching for these for ages.my son has a pair of these tripp pants that are just about ready for the bin !couldn\\'t believe my luck when i found them on  amazon at bewild.the last pair on the internet and they just happen to be his size! he\\'s going to be very happy at christmas thanks a million !!!!!! these are great pants...very comfortable and good quality.  i am 5\\'3&#34; and about 125 pounds and ordered a small.  length was great too.  would definitely recommend! these pants are my most fav they are so comfy and worth the price and worth the wait. you could mix these pants in many different ways i hope you enjoy these pants just as much as i do. pants are very comfortable. slinky material. somewhat see-through when fabric is stretched. flowy material looks great when you walk. great i say this and fell in love with it, though my son will not fit into it for several more months.<br />i cannot wait to dress him up in this outfit and hold him. the fabric is to die for! it is sooo soft! it is very thin...maybe something you would not expect from the pictures, i would think it would be more of a spring or summer outfit, than a cool weather one. but non the less. it is greatly made and the fabric is silky soft! though we didn\\'t end up using it that much, my daughter preferred the regular pull ups from huggies more than this, but it works for us! we ended up donating these! love these pants.  the material is very soft and they are so comfortable.  i think they run just a little small, probably not small enough to change your size selection because the pants definitely stretch. i love these pants! they are really comfortable and look great. they are a little bit long but fine for pajamas. i always wash them inside out to help protect the hogwarts logo. they are harry potter pajama pants so how can you go wrong? they are comfy. loved it ! i thought i had ordered a medium however they were large. fits loose it still looks good the haggar gloria slacks are wonderful!  as a woman of a \\\\\\\\\"certain age,\\\\\\\\\" my waist seems to be disappearing; however, i\\'m not ready to settle for elastic waists.  these slacks are smooth fitting and perfect for office wear.  i have them in 6 different colors. don\\'t wait til halloween to rock these tights.  they are so cool and fit really nice. the graphics are as clear as i\\'d like them to be i am in the process of potty training now.  my daughter does well in the mornings which is when i use these.  i do put a waterproof liner over them so i don\\'t have messes to clean up.  she can easily tell when these are wet and begins to understand that the diaper is no longer the place for pee!  she loves the pattern one and pink one very much.  we ordered two of these sets and love them.  these are not for big messes as they don\\'t hold that much, but have been helpful for us when our daughter had the idea of potty training for part of the day. very very sexy comfy shorts. love them!!!!!! nice and warm and comfy. i like that they are cargo pants with actual functional pockets. they fit as expected and can be adjusted via the straps at the sides. i\\'ve purchased two pairs already. i may purchased a third. they are so comfortable and quite durable. these yoga pants are a perfect fit- i am currently between a size 6 and 8, and they fit perfect- not baggy at all- perfect at the waist. cute fold over color- now i want to get these in more colors as i do my yoga class a least 3x per week, i need to get more! love these and the quality- not too thick or no bulky- just the right amount of material and thickness for yoga comfort when you start to heat up during class. great high quality yoga pants! i had my fingers crossed that these would not look & feel like $20 sweat pants and they don\\'t. they\\'re actually great pants with 6 total pockets, easy drawstring waist & legs and they even have a zippered fly. be aware that these aren\\'t made of a heavy fleece but they\\'re not too thin either, kind of in-the-middle. i bought them in large/gray but they fit midway between medium & large, keep that in mind when selecting a size. the price is so right i\\'m getting 2 more when other colors become available. the value factor makes these 5 stars all day long. i\\'m a new mom and so i went a little crazy buying cute clothes; but i am discovering that snaps, socks, gowns, and tights are all kind of a pain.  in my opinion, a long sleeve onsie and these soft cozy pants are the perfect outfit for winter time.  easy to change diaper!! and these pants are very cute and soft.  baby soy makes good quality stuff. the leggings is super stretchy. i wear a size 14 uk bottom, and i ordered in a size l. it is a perfect fit. i am so in love with it. the shipping was on time too. i definitely recommend fits true to size, good length. i am 5\\'5&#34; and they reach the bottom of my feet. not as soft as some pants, but for the price they are great!! thanks!  wasn\\'t expecting the package because it was delightfully early!  awesome deal as well!  it\\'s for my mom for xmas and she is going to love them! i purchased this pants for my husband. received it before the estimated delivery time. he loves it, the fit is awesome and the material is just right. perfect for work or going to a cocktail. well worth the moneyid! i paid! i looked great in them love it i couldnt be happier with these-although i must admit that i was skeptical in the beginning due to the price. but in the end i am a happy camper with the quality and the fit! i bought a 12-18mth size for my now 10mth old who is 22lbs/76cm. they are great for his creeping sprints across tile floor as well as evening strolls out on breezy days. love \\'em they are too big, and i don\\'t care.  it was clear someone had either bought them and returned them or the seller has a cat.  the tag was off of them and there was some of the cat hair that vindictive felines like to spread around.  i don\\'t care.  they are washable.  what matters is that they are comfortable.  i am far bigger than i should be, and truly, these are the most comfortable thing i own.  i wouldn\\'t wear them in public, because i haven\\'t crossed quite that far into  the &#34;letting myself go/not caring&#34; category yet.  i would though, if they were a bit smaller, the legs are extremely wide.  seriously though, very comfy.  and soft.  i don\\'t know how they are for zumba yet.  baby steps. these are probably the most comfortable long johns i\\'ve ever put on.  the pouch just kind of suspends your package out from your body... they kind of have to be worn to understand how comfortable this is.  and they\\'re warm too.  great as an under-layer if you\\'re outside and it\\'s cold, or just around the house in the winter. these are great pants! i bought them in pink stripes, but they\\'re the same fit. i love that liz lange likes to show off the pregnant belly - it\\'s so refreshing!<br /><br /> these pants are a little long for capris - i\\'m only 5\\'4. they fit more like cropped pants, but i\\'m ok with that! really happy can\\'t be better for $5,love them! i love these pants!  i am 5\\' 4\\\\\\\\\" and 117 lbs and slim hipped. these pants fit perfectly. the fabric is lovely, the colors vibrant and because of the elasticized bottom the length is fabulous.  can\\'t wait to wear them to yoga class and am going to wear them out to dinner tonight.  they are just what i was looking for!!!  will order more.  yay!!! the medium sized pants fit my 6\\'4\\'\\' husband\\'s leg length perfectly.  he has a 34\\'\\' inseam.  it was a touch roomy in the waist, but he is skinny guy - 32\\'\\' waist.  it is not a flimsy material, and was exactly what we expected! these pants are so comfortable!  the fabric is light, but not sheer.  the mumberry band helps support my pregnant belly while working out. i am decently tall and the pants are long enough.  they can also be washed and dried effortlessly. i cannot say enough positive things about these pants.  i wear them all of the time. my husband loved these pants i bought for him as a gift.  he wears them all the time.  my only complaint is the material is a bit thin and may get holes after frequent wear & washings. honestly these sweats are great but you need to order one size bigger than you actually are.<br /><br />i wear like size 34 american eagle jeans and i ordered these pants in large but honestly they feel really comfortable, just in terms of like my comfortability i would have ordered maybe a xl but that\\'s all good. it just depends on how you want to wear these sweats. they\\'re super soft when you first get them lol :)<br /><br /> i also ordered the matching usmc sweater to go with it in large too but i think i would have liked the xl ones.<br /><br />it\\'s all about how you want to wear your clothes and i kinda like my clothes a little baggy, not too baggy cause it makes me feel uncomfortable but i would definitely say that these sweats are the bomb, they\\'re nice and breathable and soft. they\\'re also stretchy and really comfortable.<br /><br />i would just like to say you should order one size up from your original pants/jeans size tho. i purchased this for a trip to philadelphia in winter. they were great, breathable but still warm. the fleece liner on the inside was nice and soft. i like it i love the pants. they were comfy and extremely sexy.  the person that loved them most was my hubby ;)  thanks! i have 6 pairs of these pants that i wear on a daily basis. they are very durable and fit well. about 30 dollars a pair is about standard for pricing, and i think is still less than a pair of levis jeans these days. this is the same company that makes issue uniforms for military, and these pants are the same quality and material as the old summer bdu/dcu pants i wore in the army. if you don\\'t like 60/40 blend or the price don\\'t buy them. if you don\\'t like that they are not made in usa, don\\'t buy them. if your a tree hugging liberal p*ssy, don\\'t buy them. if you want some rugged quality pants that will last more than a year or two, are comfortable , fit and wear like your old fatigues without the camo, buy some propper pants. these pants are very comfortable for my workouts. i have a short inseam, though (26 inches), and the xl are several inches too long for yoga. i will probably purchase these in a capri form for yoga and keep the long pants for weight training. also, they started to pill after a couple washes. it\\'s not bad and it\\'s not yet visible, but it\\'s there. i love them!!! these are great pants!  why pay $100 at nordstrom when you can get these?  i ordered a medium and they fit great.  they did shrink a bit after washing and drying, but, somehow, stretched ed back out as i wore them.  i liked them so much, i ordered them in black too.  i basically wear these all the time.  the material is good quality, very stretchy, and a medium weight (perfect for spring weather or even sitting in the shade when it is warm). my daughter is 2.5 years and size 3 fits perfect. she has always been on the 30th percentile weight and high 80\\'d percentile height.  the product is amazing! highly recommended! lil small and no room for my balls but they look good and that\\'s all that matters, right? this jeans is form china .wo waiting long time .after i saw the jeans was nice and soft with the skin. love the material of all kicky pants products. these panties are hard to find but are my absolute favorite. i wish they made more of a bulk package for us moms. i\\'m short & chubby so i had to have mine hemmed but i really like these. the pants are nice, comfy, easy to get on & off and are great pj pants. i\\'m very satisfied with the product for the price. the fit was good on these pants. it was a bit hard to get the laces on the legs right and the color had too much red tint . i haven\\'t worn or washed these pants yet. they are being hemmed as they are a little long (i am 5\\'4&#34;). loved the material and the fit except for length. would recommend these.... love these!  so soft and comfortable!!  i am 5\\' 3\\' so if you are short they maybe a little long.  very happy with them! good quality material . true fit. length is perfect . highly recommend the newport flat front pants. just love alfred dunner!!!! i ordered two pair they fit perfectly and are soft material i love working out in them . very comfortable i will most likely buy more in different colors soon. these pants are of fine quality but i believe they run small. thank goodness for other reviews. i decided to go up a size in these wallflower pants. seeing\\'s how they are different than the jeans. and i\\'m glad i did. they fit just like the 7\\'s would in the denim jean. i also realize that black jeans or pants tend to run smaller. which brings me to ask if anyone purchased the khaki colored ones. and if so, did they run the same(small)or same as the jeans. because i\\'d like to purchase the other color as well. i may also like to add that these pants do not look like the pic. the legs are much wider from the knee down. i\\'m not sure if i\\'ll like them until i wear them. i got as far as trying them before washing. i didn\\'t dry them only on a rack. but i\\'m hoping they shaped up some to give a better look. very nice design and pockets are convenient, but the fabric is not very stretchy. fit is tight, even though i\\'m more heavy set. design is great and threading is high quality, but fit is a bit tight and awkward :/ son loves these excelente producit tk the perfect pant for warm weather. its fresh and its clean. probably on of the most comfortable ppants i have ever worn, the size was perfect and the quality is great.  she wears them all the time.  they wash great too. they don\\'t lose their shape and the clothes haven\\'t faded. these are obviously made of a good quality material with sturdy construction.  however, the material is a bit thick and tightly woven, so i only wear them in cooler weather.  it is also more of a synthetic material, not like cotton.<br /><br />it fits true to size, very flattering and seems like it will hold its color for a very long time. these pants fit just like i had expected. imho they are better than the dockers i have bought in the past. the color has kept after multiple washes. these come in handy during times of inactivity - inactive aside from eating.  the holidays are approaching, so no telling what size pants i\\'ll need by the time it\\'s over. they were a smidge short but my sister loves them and is able to hide the shortness with boots. very cute. so comfy i had to order another in a different color even though this arrived about five minutes after i ordered it, i sat on the return for well over a month but they still accepted it which i truly appreciate.<br /><br />would be pleased to do business with this company in the future, even though this garment was so short in the rise i don\\'t understand who it would fit. it must be very junior, because it fit me everywhere but the rise of the crotch. ah well, everyone thought it was a shame it didn\\'t fit me because it\\'s a cute piece. fun and comfortable. my niece loved them... they were cute, fit well, and very flattering. good price and fast delivery so far i like them and they are really comfortable. for me, wearing jeans in very hot and humid weather is mostly annoying so they will come handy.<br /> the fit is just perfect but i see some complains regarding the fit. i would suggest to contact the seller and ask with reference to your measurements. i just hope they stay the same after washing. perfect fit.  arrived exactly on time. love it a little big but it\\'s beautiful ‚ô° the cotton is very comfortable and durable. the pockets don\\'t ball up when you are sleeping to make annoying little lumps if you turn over. they are the perfect amount of breathable and warm for me. also, cat hair rolls and washes off easily. these pants are soft and sturdy! my 2 ¬Ω year old grandson is very fussy about how clothes feel, and he really likes these! they look great too! cute - not too dressy but ok to wear to work! i liked these. they fit a tad small, but not so small that i had to return them. the &#34;liquid&#34; part of the leggings started peeling off around the 5th wear. my daughter just enlisted with the marine corps and i was looking for a stocking stuffer for xmas. she was very happy and is looking forward to wearing her sweatpants when she runs... my granddaughter was in a play and it fit her perfectly.  good quality. love them i love how these pants feel. they look very sexy. for the price it\\'s just amazing. my boys prefer pull-on pants, which they wear for school uniform pants.  these are good quality, well-made, and at a reasonable price for boys who are hard on their pants. when purchasing slacks u usually get polyester. this was an excellent material perfect fit. they are sweat pants.  what else can i say.  they are well made, and fit correctly. love them! so cute and comfortable! really love the fit, feel and comfort of these stretch pants. i would have given them 5 stars, however, they had two areas around the crotch at the seams where the stitching had started to split. i had already put them on when i noticed. there were other areas that were a little weak in the seam as well. had this not been the &#34;last one&#34; in my size, i would have returned them. i stitched them, al these pants are very cute in person and made a great gift for a dog lover!  size was accurate and price was good for product. i bought these for my daughter who is in color guard and she just loves them! well made, great fit! fast delivery! i like it, but it\\'s too large! i ordered a small t_t they arrived within a few days of ordering.  the outfit was well made and fit just right.  the quality of materials is good. for what you pay these pants work well, the sizing is accurate but the length needs to be an inch or two longer, i\\'m only 5\\'6\\\\\\\\\" and they are about an inch too short but i only use them in the house so i\\'ll survive. but great for the price! nice pants this was my second time buying a pair of these pants. same size i previously ordered, completely different fit. dont get me wrong, they fit, and i wear them often, but if your buying these, do not expect consistency. you get what you pay for. it was good to sleep pants. very very sexy comfy shorts. master goh slashed his razor sharp katana at my head for what seemed like the thousandth time. however, unlike the other 999 times, this time, he missed. you see, it was 1988, and i had been training with master goh in the wild forests of nepal for the past five years.  on this day crisp beautiful fall day, my training would end. i looked down at the blood and excrement crusted zubaz pants i wore, stained dark and nearly black with the years of pain and suffering and i thought back to that day in 1983 when i first showed up on master goh\\'s doorstep. the zubaz pants a marvel to behold, the crisp, almost angelic white broken by the sharp blue stripes. master goh took one look at me standing there with my flowing locks of hair, my bare chest glistening in the noon day sun, and my electric blue zubaz pants and began my training immediately by kicking the ever loving snot out of me.<br /><br />i thanked him for this first lesson and returned the next day. again, upon sight of me he thrashed me into unconsciousness. this continued for five long years, each lesson increasingly brutal as it seemed he never held back. teaching me with fist, foot, sword, staff, nun-chuck, throwing stars, rifles, shotguns, glock 9mms, fruit, dishes, and even a bottle of [[asin:b00032g1s0 tuscan whole milk, 1 gallon, 128 fl oz]]. it was in that third year, after he beat me to unconsciousness with that bottle of [[asin:b00032g1s0 tuscan whole milk, 1 gallon, 128 fl oz]] that i told him of the day seven years prior, in 1981, when the no-armed man killed my parents while trying to pour himself a glass of [[asin:b00032g1s0 tuscan whole milk, 1 gallon, 128 fl oz]] and how i had to train in order to seek out my vengeance.<br /><br />my tears must have reached him, for the next day when i arrived for my lesson, i left his doorstep with my bowels as yet un-voided. i sensed a great satisfaction from my sensei, after i told him my training was complete and that i wouldn\\'t return the next day. i had learned all i could from him, my training was complete. a single tear dropped from his eye as he realized his mornings would never be the same either. he would no longer have to wake up and train me in my zubaz pants. i had learned a great lesson. i would be ready to fight the no-armed man. i would journey home. i would wash my zubaz pants. and in twenty three years i would sit down on my couch and i would read my copy of [[asin:0870334336 how to avoid huge ships]]. little did i know the juggernaut of a secret from my past that would come crashing though my walls of denial and change the course of history on that day.him, my training was complete. a single tear dropped from his eye as he realized his mornings would never be the same either. he would no longer have to wake up and train me in my zubaz pants. i had learned a great lesson. i would be ready to fight the no-armed man. i would journey home. i would wash my zubaz pants. and in twenty three years i would sit down on my couch and i would read my copy of [[asin:0870334336 how to avoid huge ships]]. little did i know the juggernaut of a secret from my past that would come crashing though my walls of denial and change the course of history on that day. these pants are great. i use them everyday and they wear well. great for weight loss.... i love these pants!! do they sell in 3x? regardless the 2x fits as expected. i normally wear a 44w and these are snug but because of the stretchy material i get a lil room and a slimmer looking fit....have taken photo shoots and will be performing at a stage concert with them **2 thumbs** look a bit like muscle shirts now, but twin babies have been able to wear these for several months. have been machine washed but line dried. snaps have held up well. material is thick and washes well. i had to adjust it lengthwise though. size small fits 5\\'6&#34;, size 6 body frame. not too crazy about the plastic thingy that\\'s hanging on one of the leg . i bought these for zumba.  i am 5\\' tall and some other pants have too much length.<br />they seem to be a nice, somewhat breathable material and they washed well. had to hem them one leg 1 1/2 longer than other. they will be fine for spring and fall. i ordered these for my grandson because his favorite color is purple.  these are advertised as purple camouflage; and they are from the purple store, but they are not purple, they are violet. the tag says \\\\\\\\\"violet\\\\\\\\\", not purple.  they are still a great pair of pants with waist tabs for a good fit, drawstrings at the ankles and lots of pockets.  however, i wish i had known that they were not a true purple when i ordered them since i ordered a purple shirt to go with them and it does not look good with them. very cute and high quality material. fits a little small but still cute. i\\'ll buy next size up next time. üëç really good it\\'s how i expected it these are a lot longer and thicker than i thought they would be, but this is not a problem. they can be bunched up and stay up and also the cushion near the butt can be concealed even with a thin tank top. very soft and warm pants, and should fit even those of average height i love kicky pants because the kind of bamboo that they use is super solf and silky and not cotton-y like most other bamboo clothing brands. these bloomers are super cute! they don run a little small but i was able to find an awesome gift set that had all three colors in various sizes along with a beautiful silk headband that we used for my daughter\\'s newborn pics. it\\'s a great way to have the three different sizes and colors... (the headband matches all)! check it out:  [...] excellent love it great product it came earlier then expected and i was really happy(: fits good just some strings were not cut and i thought it would be more baggier and different type of texture but it was good(: bought this for my 16 year old son.  he loves them.  soft and comfortable.  a little long for his height but easy to hem. good fit and feel for intended purpose. this is a great light business suit.  the legs are long (they typically are) so i will have to hem them up a bit before i can wear it but it is nice enough for any business event these yoga pants are super comfy, fit well and the price is great! i ordered a bit big and he has time to grow into it.  he loves it and can barely wait for halloween to wear it (made him promise he wouldn\\'t wear it before then) and he will also be wearing to career day at school. got these for my best friend, she says they are very comfortable. also her ass looks fantastic in them! great wearing item and the price was good too. bought them for my wife as christmas present.  fit great!  she loves it.  wears to daily workout sessions as club. i exchanged the 7s for 6s and they are fine.. this brand of underwear lasts forever!  i have a pair that i have had for over 20 years and it is still good.  i wish i could find more of them, with lace on the sides, like my older pair has.  the waistbands are great, and they hod up in washing, etc very well.  very comfortable also.  just run large. a little tight in a certain area... especially considering i am a medium in every other brand of yoga pant. the true test will be how well they hold up love these leggings! they are super soft and fit well. the waistband sits high but they shipped fast and are totally worth the price! wonderfully soft, stretchy, non-itchy harem shaped pants. great alone next to skin or layered over/under cotton or polyester pajamas or thermal pants. the waistband and legbands can be turned 1-2x for excess length. or tuck legbands into socks or booties. these were accidently machine  washed and dried without shrinkage! love these pants (and matching shirt)! will purchase again! comfortable!!  my son loves them! they are perfect and i\\'m ordering several more pair - so comfortable and cute!! great pants, love them they fit to size.  i  am a medium and bought a medium and fit perfect.  they even slim you down. aaa+ i love this little tuxedo onesie and pants set. it bought it for my nephew and he looks so adorable in it. although it does seem a little small for the size, but maybe thats just because my nephew is a big kid. love them there so confy and fit perfectly!! these fit great and look super hot! only thing i dont like is they have a crotch panel in themx like pantyhose do, caution whow you sit! these pants are so comfortable. they look great too. can be dressed up or down. suprisingly, my rear still looks good in these....a must buy! great price. also, i am not a big fan of the tummy pannel, but this doesn\\'t bother me. i would buy these again for summer wear - but, while they are well-made, they are very lightweight and not at all appropriate for winter/fall. i love camo pants because of the heavy, durable material they\\'re made of. i\\'ve taken a few falls on the road in these and wash them often, and you can tell they are good quality. we bought these in 6-12 size for our 16lb, 10 week old son for a san francisco giants night game. he was toasty warm. they are very thin, but merino wool, which dries fast and keeps kiddos warm. we paired with the merino wool onesie and both are very soft and not itchy. recommend wish the elastic/drawstring waist had button front, but excellent garment for the price i love the pants but they weren\\'t mint green like the pictures that was a little disappointing but they fit perfectly and i will be keeping them great item - fits nicely and well made.  wash well.  best price is on amazon for this item - most military shops want double.  definetly recommend. these pants are neither dark navy like 1st photo nor blue blue like the later photos... the color is a dark blue/light navy the reviewers who have expressed skepticism about whether or not these are \\\\\\\\\"one size\\\\\\\\\" are probably right. they fit me nicely at the moment, but if i gained weight, i\\'m not sure how well they\\'d fit- they\\'re pretty snug. also good to note is that the beige color is a lot less yellowy than it is in the picture (which i think is a good thing; it\\'s a nice color in person), but it is also a tad see through. choose your underwear with caution, or wear a short dress or long top that will cover that area. otherwise, i like them a lot! i was very please when i received these pants. i have them in egg plant as well and could not wait to wear these when i saw them. the price is right. they are very subdued in the design. there are very tastefully sized colored stones on the faux pockets that add a bit of flare to the pants. i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; & they fit fine. not too long and definitely not too short. i\\'m a thick girl and they fit fine w/ a bit of stretch to them.<br /><br />i recommend these. i use these as my sleep pants and i love them!  i ordered the navy, in medium, i believe. i wish i had gotten more pairs, in more colors, in fact, as i write that, i\\'m ordering another pair, but in charcoal grey. this is exactly was i expected. great quality, size fit as expected, looks very nice on my little boy. thes are great, overall very happy with length and fabric quality. a little smaller than expected and makes the top area a little shear. but other than that great purchase! these are so stinking cute. i just love them. they are very comfy and stylish. great buy, with no regrets. they fit good. im kinda of thick, so while dancing, they fall. other than that, amazing. thanks so much. ! i love the design on these and i have received multiple compliments on them from family, friends, and even strangers. they look exactly like the picture and fit nicely. absolutely love these, i give them 5/5 stars! these pants look great! i used them as a bathing suit cover-up.  i wear a size 6 or 8 pants, and after reading other reviews, i decided to get a large and they fit perfectly! the pant fits wonderful and my history put me on is good side so thank you so much for making my first day a wonderful one. these pants are comfy and they fit just fine. i was glad to see them in a cropped style, because i\\'m kind of short, and regular-length pants are often too long on me.<br /><br />my only complaint with these pants is the label in the back, which was bugging me so much that i cut it off. i know some companies are now printing the label info on the inside of the garment. if this manufacturer would do that with these pants, they would be perfect. these pants are amazing! not too thick or thin and super comfortable. i sized-down like many of the other reviewers suggested, but i don\\'t think i would have needed to. i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; 118lbs and the xs are a little on the tight side. small would have been better, but i\\'m not going to bother with an exchange. hopefully they\\'ll loosen up a bit as i wear them. a year after purchasing these and i still love them. perfect! i\\'m an l, fits as expected!! bought these in charcoal and teal also! next i\\'ll get the garnet. love it. as a hard tail guru and president of their fan club, i have never seen this color. i may order another! and this sender was so quick. i\\'m 5 ft 2 and 120 lbs and extra small fits well.  nice fit. love these pants. have them to a friend for christmas and she loved them i ordered men\\'s small for her and she said they fit like a dream. very fast shipping as well. these are very soft for baby, no tags.  high quality as usual from this brand.  the size is 3-6months so they are long for a 3-month-old, but my son will grow into them and they\\'ll get a lot of use. i love them, the insides are so soft and the pattern is fabulous. i\\'m so glad they were worth every penny. soft, comfy...and can actually fit over my son\\'s chunky thighs :) much better than other 3t undies for potty training. i have been shopping amazon forever and this is my first product review; that is how great these pants are.  they are a great quality, the fabric is substantial, but soft.  really impressed with the quality, especially at this price. these pants are so much cooler than others i have tried!  my only issue is that they are noisy.  i would compare the sound to the sound that taffeta makes.  i will still use them regardless of the noise because they are so comfortable! my baby its always looking colorfull and cute!!!! thx to u guys!!! xoxo!!! a little large but keeping them...i love how i sweat when wearing these (i have had others before)...they come to my ankles instead of being capris (like the picture shows)...but that\\'s ok, too...i wish they could come as capris, too, though.  these could almost be reversible (yellow on one side and black on the other (except for the tag)).  they are well made and the price is excellent. this is a great belt. the buckle works just like an airplane seatbelt buckle. it is easy to fasten, it stays on securely, and it unfastens easily. it is also very easy to adjust the size and fits perfectly through jean belt loops.<br /><br />the captain america theme is vibrant and awesome! mom loves these pants since they fit well and keep her warm! material feels amazing but just too small. oh well, gives me something to work even harder to lose weight for.. it does look exactly like the picture though. back is out and it is very comfortable. just small. love all this look, bought almost all their garments. highly recommend them however if your larger then a size 10 it might be too sma these are very soft and comfortable and stay in place during activity, no having to hike \\'em up, money well spent. really comfy pants! working out with them is really great:) these are so soft and they are padded, great  they are comfortable and easy to wash.  definitely worth a try. i am in love with these leggings!! they are sooo soft and comfortable and fit perfectly. i wish i could wear them everyday. i get tons of compliments on them...please make more!! definitely going to get the christmas print soon!! these pants would have been perfect if not for the long length. i don\\'t have short legs so this is not an issue i run into often. very comfy though :) i love the pants, they fit well everywhere, and they appear to be a reasonable weight of gabardine fabric.  the waist is tight for me, but easy to alter.  i ordered one of each basic color, 5 pairs at this time. these are very comfortable but attract pet hair like a beast. these are somewhat larger than what i expected for a medium. i\\'ve got some hips and an ass and i\\'ve got plenty of room. i\\'d probably order a small for myself next time and see how they fit. i have lost some weight, but still..it was a little big to begin with...not a fault of the product. i think its great! i really wasn\\'t sure what to expect but these fit great and are really comfortable. they are thin and not the best quality but for the price, they are perfect what can i say - we have a draw full of princess panties and a 12 pack of these. my 3 year old prefers these - i think that they are just more comfy. for all the same reason as others mention they are just great. washable, easy up and down, durable. worth the money by far over pullups. we\\'ve been wearing them for nearly 2 years. they\\'ll probably get hand me down they are that good. remember accidents = learning. and they learn faster when they feel wet. i have looked everywhere for sweatpants like these with all the features i like, and i am very happy with these. these are great pants!  wore them to zumba and kick boxing class.  worked great in both.  i ordered a size large (i am about a size 12 or 32).  they have a very smooth fit, not binding or constrictive.  they looked super long when i opened them but once i put on with my shoes the length was just fine (i\\'m about 5\\'5).  i would love to order more in different colors! super happy with purchase. i love these!! im only 5\\'2&#34;, so they\\'re pretty long. you have to hem them. but they my fit my legs perfectly. love them love these! i saw a lot of reviews about them being super long so was afraid they\\'d be huge on me as i\\'m only 5\\'2&#34; but was pleasantly surprised when i tried them on. i bought a small and they fit great! no longer than any of my other pants. i bought it doubting again about its size, as it was asian size i think (i\\'m always afraid when i see message under item which i\\'m thinking to buy...asian size!!!) i usually buy medium size, but here i had to buy large, as it was recommended. it fit as exoected, very comfy and light pants, very good to wear in summer time. nice walking/jogging pants. good value for the price. i bought a pair of these for my wife, along with a couple of other similar pairs. they are really comfortable and she loves them. there are very few days where she will not be wearing one of them. prior to ordering a pair, i read through all of the reviews and the main complaint was that the scrubs were a size too large. i am 5\\'3&#34; and usually a size small, so with that warning i ordered a size xs. my scrubs came in two days after i ordered them and they fit perfectly. i have room to move around in them and they are not too tight or too loose. i\\'ve tried several different brands/styles of ems pants, and these by far outshine all the rest. the pockets are just right for storage of various items (cell phone, wallet, etc). the waist is lower than others i\\'ve tried, allowing them to be lower slung and fit more comfortably without feeling like they\\'re sagging in the inseam. (read: it\\'s more comfortable with my gut ;))    i do with the had a place to store trauma shears on the outside of the cargo pocket, but the included  web duty belt allows easy attachment of the tools pouch. it also supports a radio extremely well without the need to constantly be pulling the waistline up constantly from the weight. i usually buy this brand at a local boutique for much more. very satisfied as always except at a fraction of the price. goox i would wear these every day to work if i could, they are so soft and comfortable.  i got the right color.  my only complaint is that they were long and i did have to take them up...boo.  but for most they would be great.  i am only 5\\'5&#34;.  i wish they had another color i liked i would order more. these pants are great in smoothing out everything you want to hide and making the perfect shape.  spanx in general are good, but building spanx into clothes is genious.  i only wish there were more colors. was a little long but works. love these yoga pants not to long or wide at the bottom. i am 5\\'4 so most yoga pants drag on me, but i also love the material not to thin or see thru. will buy more in the future . love it love it love it went out and people was coming up to me where did i get that from they loved it and so did i can\\'t wait to wear it again!!! i tried a different front pocket wallet, returned it, and bought this one.  it has rounded corners for comfort.  it has two pockets for bills (some have none) and plenty of room for cards.  it is all leather, so no sweat. capri sweat pants perfect i had a store i once could get pants like these but that store left from my area.  i am so pleased to find that same cool comfort in these pants! these are so comfy i love them they are light fit great easy to move in and i love the look i ordered these based on reviews and price. they are a good training pant, but they are not going to soak up all the tinkle, but most. they were worth the savings in accidents and frustration even though a small amount leaked. never had an issue with the padding being uneven in the pants. my son still uses them as underwear. good quality. i love them, if only they were the right size, i would be wearing them love this pants!! would buy from this seller again!!! very happy with this purchase!!! size was right on and they look very expensive but very affordable !! comfortable, soft and easy to put on. makes for a good night sleep for comfy lounging in the house. i ordered this in summer or spring 2013. did i mention that it is flame resistant pants that costs $30? normally, most of them costs about $100-150. this one costs cheap and it gives a comfortable feeling. i wore it in airsoft games, and it didn\\'t bother me at all, no wediges or pulling it up or anythign at all. when you get mud stains or stains on this pants and you wash it, the stain comes off very easily. i reccomend you buy this if you\\'re an airsofter who\\'s looking for acu loadout. i love this brand always a great fit and i love the low crotch. if you don\\'t have a pair of these you need to buy a pair! super cute & fit really well! the fabric is soft and nice quality. they arrived in a timley fashion and they fit perfect i  just love them! size fits perfectly for me. this pant makes me look slimmer and younger. will recommend it to friends definitely! grandson luvs his enjoin joggers i wear a size 13, so finding a size that fits right is hard sometimes, but these fit perfectly, being only a little long, but super comfortable these are great! this is absolutely the best pant i have ever bought!  it is so comfortable, easy to care for and so versatile!  you can dress up or down.  i have 3 pair and will continue to buy them:-) does what they\\'re supposed to really long and roomy for a large. ordered them for 6 foot tall 200-220 pound person and these are perfect for lounging. comfortable. had to roll wasteband over once but not a problem. fabric is soft, lightweight and perfect for hanging out at home looks great my daughter was nervous about these as she looked at the picture she thought they may be more of bicycle shorts length and would be to long under her cheer skirt. they fit perfect as a work out, dance, cheer &#34;spankies&#34; and work well under their skirts as well. the feel of the material is remarkable and very comfortable. when looking at the material it may seem a little sheer but only can see through it when light is shine through it... ie if you don\\'t keep a flashlight down your pants, you should be just fine. i bought these for a size 1 and size 5 teenage girls, so i\\'m sure they become much more sheer the larger you are. they do well going through the wash, although i do hang them to dry, have already made it in the wash many of times. i will be buy more of these. i love these leggings. they are a great conversation piece. too cute for words. i get tons of compliments! true to size the petite is still too long for me. i absolutely love these pants! the first day i got them i ended up wearing them out and not only can they be dressed up or down but they are comfortable and reasonably priced compared to other sellers of these type of pants. i\\'m 5\\'3 and they fit pretty well but since the pants can be worn as a jumpsuit the waist was a little high on my torso but a tunic style shirt helped. overall i do recommend this product as i will be buying another pair. nothing says murica like american flag leggings. soft, comfy pants. the large fit perfectly these awesome pants are just as described...they fit very well and although i\\'m 55 years old, i don\\'t feel as though i\\'m trying to look 15 when i wear them. i\\'ve always had an eclectic style and these pants just spoke to me when i saw them. can\\'t wait to wear them out on the town. good quality, good price, and shipping was incredibly fast. highly recommend. i wanted wide-leg pants that didn\\'t drag on the floor so was excited to find these in petite length.  the product description used the words &#34;no see through&#34; and &#34;heavy&#34; to describe the fabric.  the first is correct but not the second.  the fabric is thin, very thin.  it is ok for my purpose - to wear around the house, primarily in the evening - but i wouldn\\'t wear these pants out-and-about.  i have worn them to sleep in and they worked great for that. these pants are awesome! they make my butt look more perfect!! it shapes them and lifts them up a little bit!!<br />i will be getting these in every color!!!!!!!! i have always been wary of yoga pants because the ones i\\'ve bought either shrunk in the wash or began to &#34;sag&#34; and &#34;loosen&#34; after a day of wear. they\\'ve always been very uncomfortable and unflattering. it wasn\\'t until a few friends of mine had a talk about yoga pants that i decided to give them another shot. the key difference: i decided to buy a more expensive pair instead of the typical $6 or $10 pants i get.<br /><br />the difference is astounding! this isn\\'t a very expensive pair, but the $10 extra really made a difference. these pants are made of a very breathable, soft material that also fit snug against my body without squeezing me. it really flattered my curves, especially my butt! they were also long enough that they didn\\'t look ridiculous on me. the best part: it withstood washing and drying! they didn\\'t shrink or get distorted in any way.<br /><br />the only warning is that they are very snug pants, so make sure you get the right size. if you are like me and you\\'re kinda in-between two difference sizes (for me, small and medium), you want to go with the bigger size (for me, i got medium).<br /><br />so if you\\'re looking for a good pair of yoga pants that are reasonably priced, will hold up in the wash, and will make you look sexy as you work out: these are the pants for you. my wife started a belly dancing class. but these pants are her favorite part of. she says they fit nicely and comfortably. item was exactly as described. the pants are well made and was the perfect size. i was very pleased and will order from again. the package was delivered on time...5 stars fit well. will continue to use as pajama pants. love all kicker clothing. soft, comfortable, natural. just wish they draw string was actually a draw string i am very happy with these pants they fit  amazingly and they are comfortable....<br />and they are a good price for what they are...<br />i took a chance on these pants because i was seeing people posting bad ratings .<br />but they are amazing!! these are pretty good pants. admittedly, i had low expectations but i am impressed. they look exactly as shown and fit surprisingly well. i haven\\'t washed them too many times yet as they did disappear for a while when i moved until i recently found them again, so i can\\'t say how the awesome logo will hold up. that being said, i will say that they are a bit on the thin side but that\\'s to be expected with pajama pants and they are quite comfortable. i would recommend these to any gamer who\\'s a fan of assassin\\'s creed and also likes pajama pants. my daughter loves them my wife loves these, and they hug her shape nicely. its hard to look sexy in flannels, but she pulls it off in these. i was a bit worried when i first bought thinking it might be not fitting. as it turned out, the fit was just right and the material was excellent. just for the record, this is my secondpurchase of the same pants. love these pants!! these are so nice and comfortable. i ordered another brand and they were not nearly as nice, the color was off and the fabric pilled. i will stay with this brand. color is perfect. these pants are amazing!!! i have a butt deficiency and these really make me look like i have one! they are a nice thick fabric and just look fantastic. i am so, so please! they do not run small! they fit perfect to size. pants are slightly larger and longer than expected, but works out great for big boys growing and forever getting into things....love these pants! these are such comfy lounging pants.  and the pattern and colors are gorgeous!  they are a nice light weight and are perfect for cool summer evenings.  i love wearing them these are the nicest quality. they are cute and roomy, run a bit large which is nice for a growing baby. well sewn! the colors are bright and stay that way after multiple washes. this set was a gift for a friend\\'s baby but i bought the larger six piece layette for my grandson and it\\'s wonderful too. you can\\'t go wrong with hudson baby! i like it,it is the right size for me, looks like the picture, soft cotton, nothing fancy. looking good for work so comfortable.  got many compliments.  wore with a sequin sleeveless top and a bright pink jacket.  i love these pants...and got a pair for my niece too! these pants are very comfortable and based on the other reviews i read, i ordered a size smaller than i normally would and found they fit perfectly.  i\\'m petite, so i don\\'t often get to buy something and not have to raise the hem.  i didn\\'t with these.  they are very well made - good enough to wear to work, and i love they have pockets.  i\\'m going to try to order another pair in a different color!  the price is so good, the quality is good and they are so comfortable to wear! these are the best lined legging i have brought. i am getting ready to buy at least three more pair. legs are quite long, so be wary if you\\'ve got a shorter length of leg. my stats:<br />male<br />32x34 pants<br />6\\'0<br />165 lbs slightly athletic build.<br /><br />harem pants fit:<br />came down to the top of my shins.<br />fit my waist comfortably.<br /><br />pros:<br />light, breathable, comfortable<br />i ordered it on july 25, they shipped july 26 and arrived july 27, and it wasn\\'t even amazonprime!<br /><br />cons:<br />1)since i\\'m pretty sure these pants are for women, be aware that there is an extended elastic band that covers half of your torso as well. you can\\'t see it in the picture, because the model is either wearing a shirt over it, or it\\'s cropped out. however, it doesn\\'t get in the way at all. my shirt completely covered it up. i just put it as a con, just in case someone isn\\'t expecting it.<br /><br />2)the tiger print is more like an applique. like something you would iron onto it. it\\'s not the same material as the pants. i haven\\'t tried putting them in a dryer yet, but if i did, i\\'m absolutely positive the tiger pattern would completely crumble apart. so, be sure to air dry them! that\\'s the only reason i give it four stars.<br /><br />conclusion:<br />i still love the pants! i think they\\'re great. they fit really well. they look really cool. and they\\'re baggy enough to walk up stairs haha. i recommend them! these pants are not like a girdle and a very slimming.  the wide waist is comfortable yet holds everything without muffin top.<br />the brown is a nice rich brown that goes with a lot.  i ordered a medium am 5\\'4 and i love the length...long enough to wear with a nice chunky heel these are short in length...waist size was good i wear these pants for work. these black pants are really nice. i was buying dickie\\'s work pants, but everytime i washed them the pants legs slowly shrank. so far these haven\\'t shrank at all. they are still kind of like skinny jeans, but not as tight... more like &#34;professional&#34; looking skinny jeans, if that makes any sense. these pants are super cute on they seem to be a little more orange than they are coral which is kind of upsetting but not too terrible i ordered a medium thinking it would run small but it actually fits as expected so order the size you did you actually need item was as described and very nice. fit as described. fit as described. not thick. not see through completely. i imagine in bright light with white undies yes it will show. however, working out running errands w black undies you will be fine. i would recommend for working out because of it\\'s light feel. i would not recommend wearing these super tight if you mind see through outside while running errands or working out. get your exact size. i am a med who usually fits into a small yoga pant but these are extremely true to size. if you get them too small they will show through. great product! thanks! there are my go-to &#34;lazy pants&#34;. i will wear them around the house but also if i go out to run errands. material is thin but not cheap, its designed to hug you comfortably and they do so accordingly. they fit a little bit bigger than the size normally worn but like i said before, gauchos are meant for that. i would buy another pair in black. they\\'re awesome. perfect great product, excellent value. my only complaint is that they are a little bit too long for my short legs. small would have been too tight, but medium was too long.<br /><br />other than that, great product. i actually liked these enough to buy all three colors.  the fabric is perfect for summer - as it is lighter weight flannel.  i like the heavier weight flannel for winter and i wouldn\\'t wear these during colder winter nights.<br />the quality is good for the price.<br />get more colors and i\\'m buying more!<br /><br />thank you. the training pants are very soft and comfortable. my little granddaughter\\'s favorite color is blue!!! these little pants, being mostly plain, can be worn by girls or boys. he loves the way they fit and feel!  he loves that they are different from other suns pants at the stores. he is an xl and it fits him perfectly. i bought these for my best friend as a christmas present! they were perfect and were just the right size! not much string, to tighten with !!  but fit well!!! these are some of the comfiest pants ever. they arrived early and they fit perfectly. the color is vibrant. i haven\\'t wanted to take these pants off since i got them. i\\'m definitely going to order more. these are so comfortable!  i\\'m 5\\'9, 154 lbs (curvy bottom) and these were definitely long enuf for me.  i like my pants to drag the ground a little. also, i think they\\'re for men so they\\'re kinda baggy on me, which is fine cuz that\\'s what i wanted.  my only issue: i\\'ve washed/dried them several times and it seems like they\\'re shrinking...the legs aren\\'t as long as they were before and the fabric isn\\'t as soft but, in my opinion, that was to be expected.  they\\'re not highwaters are anything but they\\'re just not as long as i want them.<br /><br />all in all, i think these are great! would recommend for anyone, especially hp fans!! there good great peice these are great pants. i was worried about possibly ordering the wrong size. i had gotten a small based on the other reviews. they fit perfectly. they are longer which i love. they fit me perfectly, i really enjoy how comfortable they are to wear. these were the additional pants that i ordered. i am very pleased with both pairs. i will order again when i need them. super comfy and exactly what i expected. love it! so comfortable and fun! these are great.  i have them in both white and black, and generally wear them under petticoats and short pleated skirts. i imagine that having a fit body is a good thing with these, otherwise you could get a pretty serious muffin top. these pants are everything they are cracked up to be and more - they fit beautifully, are so slimming, and super comfortable. one of the best invstments i have made to my wardrobe. these are cute, perfect for the cold weather. i use huge cloth diapers and they always fit. worn mostly at bedtime. love them! i purchased these for my granddaughter, who is 7 years old.  she needed them for tap lessons .  these fit very well, they were a bit long, but i just used my rotary cutter to make them shorter.  her dance teacher said you don\\'t even have to hem them because they don\\'t fray. she loved the way they feel.  &#34;they are so silky!&#34; they were delivered promptly. very pretty pant for pregnacy i love it, the material is perfect and the color is exactly like the picture i love these pj\\'s.  they are so soft and comfortable.  they have a design on the bottom of the the pants that makes them super cute.  i wish they had more and different colors.  i will keep looking so i can purchase a few more.  they are a nice weight material.  i bought a large since that was all they had and it fits great.  i think it runs small so it worked out good.  i ordered a large pj bottom from a different seller and it looks like a xl.  sizing is hard on-line.  i love my new sleepwear pants. my 2 and a half year old gets excited to put his &#34;balls undies&#34; on in the morning.  we are in the early stages of potty training so we are still having a quite a few accidents.  honestly i do not have anything to compare these to but they are working fine for us.  the absorbency is not all that great on a large quantity of urine.  smaller dribbles is handles.  it has also contained turds.  our son weighs about 30 pounds and he definitely has room to grow in these undies.  i will buy this product again when we need some more.  it was well worth the reasonable price. these are uhh-may-zingg ! i love these pants , i ordered a small and i\\'m 140 lbs nn 5\\'10 . they\\'re not too short either , which is what i seem to always have a problem with . but not with these ! i defiantly will be buying more . :) love them! i want a pair in every color they offer! they fit like a glove. the length is perfect (im 5\\'8) & they don\\'t shrink or get stretched out in the waist like other yoga pants! now everyone is calling these &#34;pajama pants&#34;.<br />that\\'s not cool, even if they\\'re perfectly comfortable enough to wear as pajama bottoms.<br />they\\'ll always be baggy workout pants to me.<br />they were a must for workouts and daily wear in the late 1980\\'s;<br />and for me a quarter-century later, that fact ain\\'t changed a bit. i like the material and the print but i¬¥m petite and these &#34;small&#34; are kind of big for me..... just wish there were xs!! other than that they are cozy, comfortable and cute!! it fits and i like it very much. the material is great and smooth to my skin.  i recommend it. i love the pants, but they are not perfect, made in china? i prefer made in usa, the pockets could and should be larger. the quality is fair for the price. i just simply love the pants.  when you gave different sizes and they actually fit, that\\'s a good thing.  you dont\\' realize how long i\\'ve been looking for these pants.  last pair i purchased claim to be a plus size.  they were alot smaller than your large. i was so disappointed.  the large is an excellent fit and they\\'re so comfortable.  thanks so much. just received these pants, was a skeptic thinking they might look bad, came out amazing! way better then what pic shows.... perfect fit and great quality i totally enjoy my alfred dunner newport flat front denim pants, perfect fit, perfect length.  i believe any woman who has a problem of swelling around the waste.  it makes me feel real relaxed and happy. fits great and is comfortable they are very comfortable and a little more fashionable than standard sweatpants. if i need to run out to do an errand, i don\\'t feel sloppy wearing these out. i really like them. they are soft, fit very well in length and at the waist. i\\'d buy another, if they were just a tad cheaper! every since i moved to the south i miss my nyc fashion . finding this seller with some of my favorite clothes was amazing . so happy . great i am so glad i ordered these!  i love them ... i am a tall woman, 5ft 10!  and they are perfect and x-tra long which i love!  they are soooooooooooo comfy... i can\\'t order womens workout pants because they are always way too short!  thanks!  and the chinese writing is also cool!  i want to order more of this style and any other clothign with chinese writing! it fits well. and we love the fact it is 100% cotton.  however, it\\'s not water proof, so we use another layer on the outside.  updated review: my kid is a small kid, she is 3 now and still use these as regular underwear.  very nice i was hesitant to buy these pants at first because skinny pants often run smaller than expected, but these fit my general size excellent and are surprisingly comfortable, and they look great!  would definitely recommend this product. this was my third purchase for the romper/ pants.  they are incredibly comfy & extremely fashionable (be sure to wear your accessories with this one).  they\\'re as described &shipping was quick. these have a wonderful, fitted style to them.  the quality is better than expected.  i wish i would have purchased more exactly like this instead of the other colors.  the other colors have a different fit and style to them slightly. just perfect soft and stretchy nice fit. very comfortable. happy with purchase. very comfortable and warm according to my husband and father in law. nice fabric as well and washes well. nice love them! i love these,i will definetly buy more. they are soft and very comfortable.<br />good value for money. i ordered once before and this is why i am ordering again.  i like the fit and the comfort. i will be ordering more in the future. as other reviewers point out, these jeans run small.  i bought these for my 14 year old daughter for christmas and she\\'s a size 0.  i bought the size 1-2 and they fit her perfectly.  nervous to wash them in case they bled, but they didn\\'t and they didn\\'t shrink.  she loves these.  i am going to purchase in more colors!! got as an gift for my wife and she loves it really great service material great just small very cute outfit.  the pants fit like leggings .  but i would recommened the outfit.  my daughter loves the sequin top. a longer pant leg would have been preferable.  but these are ok as summer pajama bottoms. pants fit a little tight, i ordered this color in a size 3. it was the only size left.<br />i\\'m 5\\'3 125 lbs. color is as shown on the website when received. great &comfortable pants i bought 2 pairs of these based on other user reviews (note: i didn\\'t read them all) and price. i really like them, but the sizing is odd. both are labeled as medium which is what i ordered; one pair was a little tight in the tush but stretched out quickly and are really comfortable and cute. the other pair was not at all tight when i initially put them on, but are 2-3 inches longer than the first pair. in fact, they are so long that they will cover my feet with fabric to spare. it\\'s not a problem for me because i\\'ll just pin or sew a new hem to shorten the length but could end up being unwearable to someone who doesn\\'t sew. that said, they are just as comfortable as the other pair, regardless of length, and if not for the difference in sizing i would give them 5 stars. kicky pants make the most comfortable clothes. the fabric is very soft and stretchy which makes it really easy to put over baby\\'s head and arms. i suggest air drying instead of placing in the dryer as the fabric pills up very easily.  if i could have only two shirts in my son\\'s wardrobe they would both be from kicky pants! these arrived and were very cute and lightweight.  only problem was the leg holes run small while the rest of the area fit larger. finally, with these pants i have found the perfect compliment my ravens jersey!  with a very stretchy waist and ample pockets these pants are perfect for watching the game on my couch or heading out to a tailgate party!!<br /><br />now if only they made business casual zubaz.. so comfy! i\\'m 5\\'3, 180 pounds and the large fits perfect :) finally pants that my girlfriend and i can share to save money to pay back all of our student loans and other bills. i just hope we don\\'t have to be at two different places at the same time. nice too long for my short legs but otherwise fine.  still very usable. awesome for the price! would purchase again. very good quality. very see through but comfy and matches picture love these pants.  i just had a baby and was looking for something comfortable, but also nice-looking, for running errands with my newborn.  these are perfect and look so nice my husband wants me to order another pair. i bought this for a genie costume but now i wanna wear it around the house. super roomie, comfie and stylish. now i just need the guts to wear this as a onezy out on the town with heels. love these pants. fit perfect. wish they had them in black or gray. i would definitely order them. dressy enough to wear to an occasion such as a wedding. these are so great for the times during potty training when we don\\'t make it to the potty. my son feels wet, but my carpet and furniture don\\'t get soiled. usually still need to change pants, but way less mess than underwear. nice fitting. i hope they last because i like them. i\\'ve worn them for about three months now and they are still holding up to my wear and tear. that deserves 5 stars üåÉ these are not velor and fit great. i love them and want another pair. i hope amazon.com or this seller can find more, they are durable, soft, and they breath (you don\\'t get too warm like the velor products). i love them!  super comfy and look great,  getting more asap! fit as expected. these are a great fit and are true to size.  they are not too skinny and not as baggy as regular cargo pants. xl are super long in the legs, which i love &#60;3<br />comfy af for the price and fit, these are my go to chino style pants.  comfortable.  soft fabric.  roomy pockets.  i am not a &#34;dockers&#34; sized person.  they look good.  good price. long lasting...what more do you need? these are the best jeans. perfect fit always... this is my fourth pair. wash and dry with no shrinkage... even in corduroy. i love the length of these yoga pants. perfect for my 34\\\\\\\\\"ish inseam. the rayon/spandex blend is unique (compared to all of the cotton/spandex yoga pants out there; i know it says cotton/spandex on amazon but the label on my pants says rayon/spandex). this probably means they will retain their shape and color for a longer period of time. i will definitely be ordering more in different colors. the price point, origin of manufacturer, and quality can\\'t be beat. [really! i did plenty of research!]<br /><br />important note: if you do yoga and are familiar with sizing of athletic clothes, order your normal size! i foolishly went up a size and wish i would have stuck with my typical small. these are a bit baggy but i don\\'t blame the brand for that... i knew these would be too big for me when i bought them, but i reallly am digging them, keep me as warm as my old reliable hot chili\\'s best pants i\\'ve ever owned. love them. i wish you guys would offer these in petite. the size was perfect by they are super long for the short ladies. the women in my life love these !! i love these. the button on the front is starting to rip the fabric and fall of, but i have worn them a lot so i am not too upset about it. i am surprised by how comfortable they are. this is a good way to jump on the colorful pants bandwagon without going over the top. these pants skim all of my curves and hugs tightly while working out. i haven\\'t worn them for yoga yet, but the band does roll up for more coverage if needed. super soft fit is good ..comfortable..they don\\'t bag out at the knees...wash dry and wear..couldn\\'t be any easier..little long..but can be cut at hem no need to sew... price is right..would buy again they\\'re pretty tight but i love the style and the material is comfortable, friends think they\\'re weird :) \\'wish they had pockets though. these pants were the 2nd pair i\\'ve ordered in 2 month\\'s.  they arrived actually a day early.  i bought these pants for my grandson\\'s.  they are so adorable and comfy for toddlers.  i would highly recommend. the waist of the pants are just a teeny bit small for me, but the legs, butt, and thighs are a great fit. i bought the size twenty first, and they fit perfectly when i put them on, but after i had been wearing them, they kept getting more loose throughout the day. i decided that the 18 would most likely fit better, and it did. i don\\'t have to pull these up all day long, and i don\\'t need a belt. love them they are so comfy! he says there very confterble my husband has had a difficult time finding unisex scrubs at stores in our area so he bought these.  he loves them, except the pants do run big.  he normally wears a 36-38\\\\\\\\\" pant size and bought a large according to the size chart.  he can tie them but he really needed a medium instead. 30\\\\\\\\\" inseam, plenty long for 5\\'7\\\\\\\\\" gal.  no waistband.  true to size.  ordered in summer, so have only tried on, but look forward to wearing this winter.  smooth and clingy.  so glad this came in mahogany spice (which is dark brown) - not just white or black. very different! loved them! the only issue is the seems didn\\'t match up so the print was a little off. fit as expected. it is just as pictured. looks good. came quickly. would give a 5 star rating, but the cost seams high to me, plus pockets & belt loops could be bigger. the are comfortable & the camoflauge is good. size (3x) is perfect, and good on length. best sleeper a baby can only dream about! ordering more!  these will last through the next baby and many more. my granddaughter loved the very soft pj\\'s we bought her. i thought the price was very good. a great value for the quality. i\\'m 5\\'10 and they\\'re a little bit too long on me but the fabric thickness is perfect, they\\'re comfortable, and probably my new favourite pants. i definitely plan to buy more. my kids love when i wear my tmnt pj pants. they are so comfy and colors are bright and images are very clear. would definitely buy more! gift for granddaughter. she loved it. thanks i like these pants and have purchased 6 pair. i am 5\\'3&#34; and so they fit me well after washing.  the waist does not have a lot of elastic in it but it has a drawstring. they are comfy and i wear them to the store, around the house and to walk.  i really like these sweats! love these pants!  very warm and comfy!  the length was perfect for me.  i am only 5\\'2 so taller people may find these a little too short, but i love them.  i read some reviews that they have torn up easily, but i have washed and worn them quite a few times and so far they are holding up well! these pants look great (i\\'m a 5\\'6 woman and ordered a small). the colors are bright and they are really cozy with a soft pajama feel. there are not thick material but i knew to expect that from the review.<br /><br />the reason i took off a star is there is a hole right in the crotch. i can take some thread and patch it up, but for $20 you\\'d think they could at least make sure there are no holes (and i see that others have had this problem too). they fit, they are durable. will buy more. great for a lazy weekend. please buy - such a treat to slip into after work . i wish i would have gotten earlier in pregnancy ! i love them! i purchased this product years ago and still trying to hang on to the worn out pair i have. i love them and looked throughout my local stores and never could find them again.  i was amazed after such a long time finding them on amazon!  i plan to purchase additional pairs.  they are great in the winter very warm and comfortable. i love these pants. they run a little small but that is the only negitve thing i have to say. the colors are bright and the quality is above average these are the right size but fit a little slim.  like the fabric and seem well made. note: these scrub pants were not used specifically as such - they were used as costume pieces. this review addresses their use in that capacity.  i was a director for a student act at a university in which students were depicting mario from the popular nintendo games. as the director, it was my job to procure highly inexpensive costume pieces that got the look across. after searching far and wide across the internet for something that met my criteria, i came across these pants, which were perfect! absolutely the best deal i could find, and they looked and worked perfectly (much better than sweatpants, which was my original idea). the pants were comfortable to move around in, and ran a bit large (which was fine for our purposes). the seller, salus uniforms, was excellent as well - they had run out of stock in some sizes of the 1-pocket, but without any hassle they offered to send 3-pocket pants instead. the order arrived quickly and professionally packaged. i would definitely recommend to anyone who needs to buy pants in bulk, and i imagine that nurses would enjoy them as well (though the 3-pocket is probably more handy than the 1-pocket - not very practical if you actually need to hold anything in your pockets). (if you\\'d like to see the pants in action, visit youtube and search \\\\\\\\\"grad sing song 2011.\\\\\\\\\") my boys are in the 90th percentile for height and weight so im used to buying about double their age but id if theyd had it in 5t i would have done that (i did 4t) hes 2.  its incredibly soft and adoreable and light enough for summer cozy enough for fall and spring. these are great! i wish there were more footed baby pants around, because they do away with the baby sock issues. these run a little large, but they\\'re great for long tall babies. super soft too. i ordered 6-9 size. the price is great) they are very wide, though, even after wash. color stays nice after several washes and they feel very soft. good buy ++ most people ordering pants like these are doing so for halloween or a 70‚Äôs party of some sort.  this is the first occasion that i have taken time to write a review.  i felt compelled, because i returned 3 sets of 70‚Äôs costumes before i found these!  i did not purchase them initially, because no one provided a review.  these pants are awesome!  unlike most halloween attire that is thin, cheap polyester, and/or poorly sewn together, these pants are think, high quality, and durable.  i dare to compare, but they are made of similar material and quality as the white house black market pants i love.  if they were in fashion now, i would wear them every day!  i would give them 10 stars if i could.  here is the help i would like to provide when ordering‚Ä¶  these pants are ‚Äúone size.‚Äù  logically, we all know that one size cannot fit all.  i am 5‚Äô6‚Äù and 134 ibs, and they fit me perfectly.  due to the high-quality fabric, i really can see how these can fit someone comfortably (without falling down or being too tight) within a pretty large range.  my best guess is 105 ibs to 160 ibs.  if you are smaller than 105 or larger than 160, these may not be for you.  if you are within that range, i endorse these pants 110%! it\\'s good for a costume, the seems on the inside are a little hap hazard and the zipper on the fly doesn\\'t have a stopper at the top but apart from that i\\'ve owned these for a few years now and they\\'re still kicking. nice color. it was gift. arrived promptly pants are a tad long but work fine with heels.  super comfy and colorful.  my go to evening pants, for lounging about. bought newborn size for my baby girl and it\\'s a little big, but that\\'s ok because she will grow into it and will be able to wear it for a while.  i love kickee pants this item of emo 2 pc track suit was for my grandson\\'s birthday.  he loves it!! couldn\\'t find anything like it in the local stores. im 5 ft 8 and these are long enough and fit great! i will def be buying more in the near future! love the feel of these pants. it\\'s like wearing pajama pants, but i look sharp & fashionable. these pants make you run faster, jump higher, and lift harder. women can\\'t wait to get you out of them and you can\\'t wait to uppercut them when they try to touch them. only four stars because they don\\'t have cargo pockets. great shorts, not familiar with the brand but they are super soft and very cute, i wouldn\\'t say they are 6.5 long, closer to 6 but they are very cute! not the dressiest pair of \\\\\\\\\"dress pants\\\\\\\\\" ive ever had (pretty much leggings with pockets and a zipper) but not bad for the price. i wore them with a long shirt to work (i work in a corporate office environment) and i didn\\'t get any awkward stares so i\\'d say they served their purpose. these are the same quality i got from the military great item great price these are my favorite pants  the fabric drapes beautifully and is the perfect weight for south texas weather, year roundp  i have three pair now and hope they will be made in other colors very helpful with size.  quality very acceptable. i ordered a 29 which they didn\\'t have. so i accepted a 28.  they are a bit small and hanging in my closet with tags and never worn . very nice heres a gift with the potential to please the giver.  better in person or on one i should say.  very fun to see. loooooove these. they are so comfortable and i got the royal blue color, and it matched exactly what was on the screen! i like the dark color of these training pants.  they are a good fit for my 24 month old who weighs 23 pounds. slacks were as advertised--sized accurately, comfortable and classy.  have worn them in spain as well as in the caribbean.  kept wrinkle-free and wore well. this product is working well for us while training our 20 month old son. they have enough padding to keep from major leaks but definitely let him know when he is wet. while wearing the training pants he can tell when he needs to use the potty or will notice right away if he starts to go in his pants. i like it. fit perfectly and they are comfortable. i wouldnt use it for running or any other tipe of activity besides yoga and home. just as advertised.  fits wife great was for my granddaughter,she really did like it. it was made from nylon ,which she likes because she can\\'t take to heat when she sleeps im pretty short (5\\'2&#34;) and thin and these look great. they\\'re super baggy and comfortable and are warm enough that i can still wear them during fall. when its extra cold, i just put a pair of tights or leggings underneath and i\\'m good to go!<br /><br />i highly reccomend these!! very flattering to the figure. bought this for my mom.  she called and was so excited.  she said this suit is beautiful and fit perfectly.  she is hard to fit and please so i was very satisfied with this purchase. i love these, and so does everyone else who sees me in them. super rad lightning pants, great for acro yoga or just running around town. they fit great and work wonderfully! i loved these pjs my baby is 14 months so i ordered 18 months size ( i don\\'t like very snuggy fit ) other than little long from the feet area fits great ! i\\'ve worn lots of small waist bdu\\'s over the years. small is always perfect for me. it even leaves a little extra half-inch or so in case i eat too much and need some room for temporary gut expansion.<br /><br />but this is the first pair of small bdu\\'s that are actually too tight for me. they\\'re so tight that it\\'s cutting off circulation and causing discomfort. i can cut loose the buttons and move them over as far as i can, but i really shouldn\\'t have to do that. these pant\\'s are obviously off spec.<br /><br />i love bdus because of they have a consistent and predictable fit, but not this time.<br /><br />i\\'ve owned other color patterns and fabric types by this manufacturer, and the fit was fine. i wonder is this one was a random escapee from quality control, or if the entire line of khaki poly/cotton is off? i only wish they would take this design and make it into a boxer brief. awesome comfort! would like to order the same pants in blue but did not see this option?? they are slightly large, but part of that is also the fact that they are snow pants, and with boots on they fit better. lined well at the ankles so you can avoid the issue of snow sneaking in between your shoes and pants. the fleece is waaaarm, and the pockets are nice and useful. great for walking to class and such in the snow (im in northern ohio); haven\\'t had a chance to use them on the snowmobile yet but i am very confident that they will be perfect. the fleece lining is what sold it for me most comfortable pair of sweat pants ever....only i am considered a  short wider person..and well the larger size was definitely made for someone  way taller than me...i triple roll..but the pants are so comfy i wear them anyways and all the time!!! fit well, looks good and very comfortable.  would recommend this for anyone.  easy care and easy to wear.  try it you will like it absolutely worth the money that i spent.fits perfectly ,very nice material with unique colors,looks like a real jean.<br />loved it. the are a tight fit but that is an encouragement to lose weight. it reminds me of putting on panty hose but i wouldn\\'t want them any larger because then they wouldn\\'t stay up. i am 5\\' 8&#34; and weigh 250 pounds  if that can help someone make a decision about making a purchase. but if u have wide calfs they are going to be too tight. i was worried when i ordered these leggings because i was hoping they would not be see-thru!  they are perfect!  very comfy!  i highly recommend! these are great training pants, they catch pretty much an entire pee, but the little one is wet so she knows what has happened. i recommend these all the time. (my first child was potty trained by age 2, training my second now). i\\'ve been using these pants for only a few days and trust me, you sweat! my underwear are always soaked after my workout. i already see a difference in my body. yaaaaay!<br />i haven\\'t seen any weight lost yet, but the key thing is inches anyway. i definitely recommend getting these. i\\'m not sure why there are any bad reviews about how well they work.<br />also, mine do fit like capris, i guess it just depends on what size you get. i assume the larger size you get, the longer the pants are.<br /><br />my workout: insanity by sean t (original program)<br />weight: 164<br />size i purchased: small<br />height: 5&#34;4 or 5&#34;5 (either one. i\\'m not sure)<br />hope this review helped someone decide! happy sweating! :) super satisfied these are the first pants i have bought since i found out i was pregnant. they are wonderful. i bought them in my sixth week when my other clothes were tight. i rolled them down and i still have room to grow. i recommend them to anyone whose pre-pregnancy pants are too tight. perfect pants! i\\'ve had trouble finding pants because i have a tiny waist and a big bottom. these pants actually fit properly unlike other brands\\' &#34;curvy&#34; styles. no gapping! great for work, pants are a little long (i\\'m 5\\'5&#34;) but they are fine w/3&#34; heels. other dress pants are usually an inch longer than these. they are very soft and nice to relax in. the fit is just right for me and seem to be durable. i really like them. love the way they fit and feel. wide draw string.  definitely not cheaply made. worth the money and more for these pants kids looked awesome in these with their pirate costumes it\\'s so trendy and comfy but i should have ordered a size down. it\\'s exactly what is pictured here though so i cannot complain i love it. and it doubles niceley as genie pants which is cool. the material is light so it\\'s ideal for spring/summer. you can play it up with black pumps or play it down it cute sandals. either way it\\'s a nice addition to my wardrobe. x great seller!!! everything went perfect!!! just when i think i couldn\\'t  love these pj\\'s more than i already do, a day after i bought them i found the pockets!  yes...they have pockets.  amazing. cozy, comfortable, stylish and they have pockets! i may never take them off! i will start out with, they\\'re very comfy pants. why not five stars, you ask?  well some many years ago, i owned a similar set or two of some ufos that were micro-suede or something or other that were (and would still be, if not for wear and tear) my favoritest pantloons ever, and these aren\\'t those.  so they lost a few points. slightly smaller and tighter than expected. fast delivery and shipping. color is as expected. not bad, but not my favorite.  leg length shrunk a bit after a few washings.  now a bit short unless i an wearing boots and i am a 32 in seam. they are awesome love them. even got more as gifts. every one asks where i got them. perfect love it! so comfy, and a great fit! love them! i would go up a size from the normal size if you are going to try to get a comfy fit.  so if you are typically an xl- these may not be too great as a biker weather sometimes is hard to fight, i use this pants with my columbia rain jacket and is perfect. surprisingly soft, very comfortable, but definitely more like pajama pants than pants i would wear out and about. the material is really light weight and a good quality. they\\'re kind of baggy on me, but i expected that (and wanted that look). i\\'m petite (5\\' 0&#34;) and can wear this as pants or as a romper that comes to just above mid calf. i was planning on using these for a costume, but have actually been wearing them out a lot and it looks really cute! i got it fast.  simple & effective packaging.  it\\'s huge.  i could let my biggest or smallest friend borrow it--that\\'s if they could get it off my back.  new favorite item for summer!! was great...i always appreciated the quality of tommy bahama clothes.  did have to dry clean it before wearing due to &#34;packaging dust.&#34; shirt and shorts provide great coverage.  i purchased it a bit larger than my child so it would fit all summer long.  well made and cute pattern on shorts. i bought these for my wife. she loves them they are thick and warm. i bought one size larger like suggested in some other jogging pants reviews and it was sage advice. they are form fitting.  the only thing i would of liked to see different is if the crotch area had a zipper or something so it is easier to have at her when we are shopping or in church. i ordered these pants for my work. seems like they are a good quality and they\\'ve been comfortable enough for a physical work like constant bending, kneeling, walking e.t.c. plus they have a nice fit: not bulky but not as revealing as skinny jeans. i\\'ve been wearing them every other day at work for at least half a year and they still look good.  i don\\'t work over there any more but i\\'m going to wear this pants as a part of my casual outfit. i got the leggings with the rips down the front, they\\'re very thin and very cute. i can\\'t remember, but am pretty sure there were no size choices. i wear a junior\\'s medium, and these are just a little tight, not horrible. didn\\'t take long to arrive, but i do wish they would loosen up. i haven\\'t wore them yet for that reason. these are so comfortable and stretchy, i love them. they look nice, fit nice, the material is great.. sits just a tad bit high on my waist, but thats because im short and i have a short waist. these are great for the cold and so soft these are the best leggins i have ever owned. i\\'ve owned 2 pair for over 5 months now and i love them. they still look new. the only complaint i have is that you can no longer find them in the store and i want more colors. i have one gray pair but i\\'m unable to find any more. please offer more colors, or a least bring the gray back see my star amount. ordered this scrub set for my husband as he works in the medical field and was needing a new set.  he wanted two pockets but not a breast pocket (he\\'s so picky).  he loves this scrub set.  :)  will purchase more in the future. these pants have reached the \\'favorite yoga pants\\' status in my wardrobe already!  they are super comfortable and stretchy.  the embroidery on the side of the leg is of \\'naturajasana\\' or the dancing shiva, and is very well done.<br /><br />according to the size chart, i probably should have ordered a medium.  but the small actually fits me just fine.  i would say if you prefer a tighter fit, order a size down (following the size chart).  also, they are left fairly long to accomodate different leg lengths, so the small works better for me as i am a little shorter (5\\'4\\\\\\\\\").<br /><br />i would definitely order another pair of these pants. sent as a gift for a girlfriend for her birthday gift.  she loved them.<br />soft and cozy and functional.<br />loved the color most comfortable leggings i own. they fit perfectly and are so soft ! shipping was quick! i wear these pants with the matching hoodie. it\\'s a perfect no-brainer outfit for those days when i just want to throw on some sweats, but still want to look put -together and chic. the quality of the cashmere is outstanding, and i love the &#34;feel.&#34; very well made pants. unfortunately although the waist fit it seemed they were huge everywhere else. i sent them back. maybe in the future i will order a smaller size and then readjust the waist with my meager sewing skills. looks great on my wife i just love these pajama jeans.  i wear them everywhere just like i would regular jeans and don\\'t think twice about it.  great fit and they feel so good on.  i have even ordered more. christmas gift loved! even though they came way too small, they encouraged me to lose a few pounds :o they are perfect now love it these pants fit great and look as pictured. i am 5\\'2 and the length was perfect. very comfortable and material is not too thin. they are also very versatile, you can dress them down with wedge sneakers or dress them up with pumps. great fitting pants these are so cool! i bought them for my boyfriend and he loves them.  they are made out of high quality material.  they are thick enough that you can\\'t see through the white, but thin enough that they won\\'t get really hot. everything was great! super service! excellent!!  great to find nice fitting pants for my grandson.  they are his favorite. my daughter loves them. expensive but cute very comfy and matches nicely w any top i bought these for my 5 year old daughter.  i wanted them to last for a while, so i ordered them a size up from what she normally wears.  they fit as i expected them to, a bit long and a bit loose, but she normally wears a size 5, so i\\'m happy.  quality is good, theyve been washed twice now and have held up well.  i would definitely recommend these for any little frozen fan. i love them came in quickly fit was perfect..very flattering these pants were perfect for what i am looking for. they are thin material but for yoga at home, or a quick work out or lounging around the house. i have already ordered two more pair! i love these lounge pants. they wash up beautifully!!! my favorite pj bottoms. i bought gray, white and pink. for some reason this review is prompting me to the tribal print palazzo pant, but i ordered the chain link pattern in a size small. i am 5\\'4&#34; and 133 lbs. these pants are soft and fits my body really well; however, they are super long. even with 3 1/2 inch wedges i\\'m going to have to cut it. some reviewers said they cut it on their own, but i\\'m nervous to do that, so i\\'ll have them cut by a professional. they\\'re exactly what i was looking for though. the fold over waist is a wee bit too wide on my waist (size 30) when i try to wear it up (i wish it was a bit more snug); but when i fold it over, of course it\\'s fine. love the colors and the pattern. i like alfred dunner, because they are comfortable and look good.  since i have trouble with buttons, i love the pull on pants.  they fit well, and the sizing is consistent. they look and fit perfectly my teen loves them. i\\'m happy my kid\\'s happy.. i wear these pants to work at least twice a week and am at 27 weeks of pregnancy currently.  i\\'ve been wearing them for awhile now.  i love them.  they are professional looking and oh so comfortable!  so glad to have gotten these pants! very comfy, nice light material, good long string to tie them off with. since having my baby these have become my go to outfit and i love them!  comfy to lounge in, shop in and workout in.  they keep there shape and stretch no matter how many times they get thrown in the wash and dryer. i bought the hoody and pants in two colors for my 80-year-old mother and she loves them!  they look fashionable and are super-cozy for her.  i tried on the ensemble and it looked equally cute on me.  i definitely recommend this item.  a tip: i fluffed the items in the dryer for about 10 minutes on low heat and it softened them up, because initially they weren\\'t as soft as cashmere should be.  also, i\\'m usually an xs and the pants were too small on me; in particular, the pockets were gaping because they were pulling across the butt.  they are perfect on my mom, who is about 5\\'0&#34; and 90 pounds.  i am 5\\'3&#34; and 112 pounds and would need a small. they were a little long for my son. we got them hemmed up and they are great quality. would buy again. real cute, fits nice! i am 5\\'5 and they fit me real nice. didnt have a problem. thinking of buying another one. love them. great thanks very much quality is a bit low but for the price as expected. just got them so i cant comment on how well they will hold up after a while of use. at this point no regrets feels super soft on the inside :) well this was a surprise for my wife.<br /><br />she totally fell in love with it. as a matter of fact, this became the pants of choice during her pregnancy.<br /><br />will totally recommend! love these pants! super comfy and stretchy .the size is accurate. love my pj bottoms. so soft and cozy. the best pair i own !!! these are, without a doubt, the best pair of pants i have ever bought. seems like they are made with the same material that my warm weather bdus were made of when i was in the military. tons of pockets, straps in the front and in the side pockets are places for one stanag in each pocket. they are durable and look good enough for church (i wear mine to church). well worth every penny. i wear these so much, under dreses and baggy pants on chilly days and as pj\\'s. super comfy and great to wear around the house on a lazy day soo glad i bought these as i\\'m a runner and it\\'s still cold here in minnesota even tho it\\'s spring the fit well and will buy more again this fall thank you beautiful bottom!! these bdu pants were just right.  comfy, useful, and strong.  love the color, too. very comfortable i\\'m 5 6 and 135, these pants are perfect at a medium. they aren\\'t as thin as i thought they would be, which is awesome! and they are nice and long which i like because i got some before from a different seller and they were too thin and too short! i already bought more of these the look is great, the style is great, i have bigger hips/thighs and a smaller waist so was a little hesitant but it worked out.  i\\'m sure i won\\'t get too many wearings out of these but the price was right for that. just what i wanted! i\\'d been on the fence about buying a pair of these for the better part of a year, i always seemed to miss out on my size from the company directly, and hated that they seemed to cost more at the 2 places i knew locally carrying them. i found them here for less money than even zubaz was charging for them and i got 2 pair. they\\'ll probably be worn most sundays in the fall for years to come. very happy with the pantsüòÄ i had to come order more. i tried three different kinds and these are the best for under dresses for dancing. i\\'m 5\\'9 and 145 and they fit perfect. definitely makes you sweat.  just working out in the flower beds and dripping sweat.  i thought i would wear a medium. it was roomy. does what it says it does. i found similar scrub pants at a nursing store but couldn\\'t believe the price. these were almost identical yet cheaper. my daughter love these and they fit perfect. just took a long time to get them. they fit well... the material is thick and appears like it will last. very comfortable. this is a soft, high quality material, 3 piece set. it is just as adorable in real life as it is in the photo. i am pleased with it. longer than expected, will need to hem. love these pants. sooo soft and comfortable. had many compliments. my 21 year old son who is a wd fan lives in these pants and says they are the most comfortable fit and material ever so zombie lovers everywhere don\\'t lose your head over these but know they are terrific! these pants are good quality and they fit really well. the price good too so i plan to buy this in all the available colours. very soft and comfy.  i would recommend this onesie to a parent. i liked the leggings. they are very comfy. only reason i did not put 5 stars is because of the random lettering on one of the back pockets and theres like a website printed on one of the back pockets. at 5\\' 205lbs i have a difficult time finding clothing that looks good on me. these harem pants fit me perfectly. they hide all that needs hiding and showcase all my good parts. love the fabric and the way it clings and flows in all the right places. best buy ever! :) my husband loves these nice and thick and comfortable i was hoping to wear these for a cosplay i am building, but they are too small for it. they are super comfy, and would be good for under dresses/skirts or dance teams. i suggest getting a size up if you plan on wearing them around i\\'m 5\\'4&#34; and i have to roll these up three times for them to even be manageable.  much better if you\\'re more like 5\\'8&#34;!  i\\'ll have to spend $15 to get them hemmed :(  i do like how the grey fold-over looks good either up or down.  covers as much or as little belly as you like. got it for my sons birthday and he loves it. it also looks more sturdy than other belts i have bought. great buy. i\\'m 5\\'2  bust 34in  about 115 pounds .and it fits just perfect, a little tight on the back side cool pants. i use them for hunting and they work great. very good quality shipped very quickly and fits just as expected friend loved product they are so comfortable.  i always get compliments on them. bot for my mother and they were a little short-waisted. really like the pants, but sizing when ordering should be done with considerable thought and down sized. i expected the pants to be roomy and comfortable, but not excessively so. i bought several pairs and going by waist size was way off. xl is really ultra large. down sized next to large, still too big and one was marked l-xl. have reordered medium size recommended for 34-36 waist (41-42\\\\\\\\\" my waist) and they fit comfortably with room to spare. very nice fit!! i\\'ve been an amazon customer for a few years now, but i\\'ve never written a product review. these pants have prompted me to do just that. the pants are of a light-weight, yet extremely solid construction and they fit great! i normally wear a size 36&#34; in pants/shorts and the large size (35-39&#34;) was just right. they are also adjustable, which is a nice feature to have. i will definitely be purchasing more of these pants in the future. bottom line, these pants are a great buy. i love these pants.  they are like jeggings, but a soft, stretchy material. the little crystal accents are cute on the pockets and they fit perfectly. and i ordered these in a large; which i regret- but if i can\\'t manage to fit into them after i loose weight and reach my goal- i am totally sure my best friend will love them when i give them to her.  xd<br /><br />these shorts are very beautiful!  i love how pretty they are!  the material is detailed and does not look cheap.  the corset-laced ribbons are not as long looking as the picture, probably because i\\'m 5\\'9, but maybe if i un-do the bows they will be?<br /><br />i was so excited and nervous to try these shorts on, but they got mostly up my thighs and i\\'m a size 14 women\\'s/15 junior\\'s right now; so i suggest anyone who is around that size to at least order the x-large because i don\\'t think i can get them on until i can wear a size 10 in women\\'s/9 in junior\\'s.<br /><br />even though they are too small for me, that has nothing to do with the quality of these shorts; they deserve all five stars!  just be sure to order a size up if you have some chub- or two sizes up if you have more of a \\\\\\\\\"gut\\\\\\\\\"- because the material doesn\\'t have any \\\\\\\\\"give\\\\\\\\\" to it. i ordered the indigo, very nice saturated, deep color.  nice around the top, nice and snug, won\\'t have to worry about it falling down.  not as baggy as in photo, but think it\\'s because i am at the bigger end of the \\'one size\\', size 12/14 and 5\\'7&#34;.  still, generous cut.  really glad i ordered the long.  would recommend long to anyone over 5\\'4&#34; or so.  will do well for dressing up at semi-formal event and will wear this summer out and about as well.  i\\'m glad i gave it a try! wore them on a 10 hour flight, wonderful fit and movement. i love it, feels nice, and warm, good price. so comfortable and great screen printing. i love my slytherin pants and all of my friends who are harry potter fans have been asking where i got them so they can buy pants with their houses on them. really fast shipping, great fit and reasonable price. i plan on getting my sister the gryffindor pants &#60;3 we love organic baby clothing! this was a gift and the recipient absolutely loved them!  she\\'s a yoga teacher and received rave reviews from her students. bella these scrubs are very nice.  comfortable, durable, breathable, and usable.  they run a little big. these a great pants. they look good: love the brit desert camo. they are cotton so they are light weight and breathe.......they are much better than a nylon blend pants, that are thick and hot. little too snug but makes me do a few extra sit ups. over all i\\'m satisfied i have now ordered twice from this vendor.  this is my style for hot summer days, but i really had to search for rayon pants.  these are beautiful, and the embroidered trim around the pant leg is a very nice touch.  customer service has been terrific - i had to call them first to check sizing (i ordered large for womens size 12) and they responded immediately after i left a voice mail.  also, they specify a week for shipping, but on both orders i have received them within 3 days.  very much recommend these pants. very comfortable! great suit i am 5\\' 4\\'\\' 120 pds 34d and suit fit and looks great! loved these ease n comfort, good material & new , nice cute pockets too.<br />smooth soft materil, looks like some spandex in der too.<br />al in all good buy.<br />love to have in many colors. i liked the cut and how they fit, but the went a little short on me, i\\'m 1.70cm, but they look nice though. pants are cute, a little too fitted above the knee for palazzo pants. the picture doesn\\'t do these pants justice. the material of the pants looks expensive.they are true to size and looks good! they\\'re nice and soft, but a little on the thin side. definitely for use in warmer weather, which isn\\'t ideal up here in alaska. i\\'ll have to wrap him up in blanket if he\\'s going to go anywhere in these. great quality and fit. beautiful and very comfy. these fit great, but are a little see through.  better used as spanky pants under a costume, than as shorts.  unless of course you like the see through look!  fast response and shipment though! nice fit  that these pants have i love the adjustable tab on the sides nice and baggy in the crouch area great for kicking high without splitting your pants :) i got these for my daughter who just had a baby. she loves them. she is 5\\'8&#34; and a lot of  the yoga pants are too short for her, but these are plenty long enough. they washed up well, no shrinkage. very nice product. great pants, i use for yoga. sizing is listed. i\\'m a 16-18 in most stretchy clothes and i bought a 2x gorgeous leggings, vibrant color~<br />always pleased with this company!<br />prompt service, products always as advertised. i ordered these on the sunday before columbus day and they came two days later. these pants are true to color and size, fit well, and are really comfortable. my only \\\\\\\\\"issue\\\\\\\\\" is that i ordered straight legged pants and got ones that were more of a bootcut, i\\'m not complaining though. i would definitely buy these again when i have a chance i find these three knit pants i got it\\'s so softs and comfortable will buy it again with difference color... very soft and comfortable. i do hot yoga, and these pants were comfortable enough to wear and soaked up the sweat pretty good to hold the stances. it\\'s a baggie look but i really like the pants.  very comfortable. can\\'t wait to wear it to zumba class. has a better length than most sweats and cover the bum when you bend over.  comfortable to lounge in or shopping. would order again. i love it,but i wish it was jean these pajama pants are really nice, however, the white on them looks more grey than white, but they are ok. these are nice but they are not as lightweight as i would have liked and they are also too long on me and i am having to get them hemmed,. i got this as a gift.  the mommy to be loved it.  it fit as expected.  this is just a fun little outfit! i recommend it these pants are so fun! they are super comfortable and flattering. perfect for belly dancing or to just wear out. i like that they ride low and are long. these are just great rhey fit nicely and seem very strethcy so i think they will last for months to come. they are super soft and cozy onlu drawback they are made in china which for as much as they cost i would have them to be made elsewhere. i like these pants for walking or just being comfortable at home. at first i tought they were a bit long but after washing them they fit ok. little big for me, but i\\'m short, haha. this was an item that my daughter picked to lounge around the house in. they look very cute on her and she says its extremely comfortable. i am actually going to purchase one for myself! good quality fabric and comfy fit. nice item as expected longer than my legs are but it still fit correctly everywhere else and was comfy. for the price this is a very nice set.  it  does run small.  my wife is a medium  abd we read the reviews so she ordered a large and it fits perfect.  if you get the right size this set is definitely worth it! this was a tough decision for me.  i absolutely love the colors and design of this outfit; however, the material is a bit thin.  so... 5 stars for the adorable factor and 3 stars for material grade.  overall score... 4 stars.  i opted to hang dry this one.  if i do throw it into the dryer, i will turn inside out and dry on lowest temperature to preserve the bright colors. i love it - looks and fits just like the photo. they are amazing! now, i need to save to buy more! squee! love them! they fit great, are comfortable, and were a good buy. for the price, it wasn\\'t bad. somewhat thin material but serves it purpose to just lounge around at home and work in the yard. length great but fit is looser than expected love the relaxed look. it can be dressed up or down. trendy!<br />very unique way to get your style noticed. love the feel,colors are beautiful,lenght is perfect very soft. fits a little large but very comfortable. i\\'m size 16, and am on the taller side (5\\'10\\'\\') i ordered the black xl. they fit perfect, they are not short at all in length. great price, good quality fabric, online buying more right now!!!! the few complaints is that they are see through... false, they are not..  that that are too long...true.. for anyone under 5\\'5\\\\\\\\\"... that the are itchy false.. they are cumfy i bought gray one in petite and love them.  very comfortable and true to size and warm too.  the price was very nice too. super soft super comfortable pant! nice enough to be dressy, but can easily be casual too. nice fit - love the wide fold over waist! i\\'m giving 4/5 just because it took forever to ship. it came the very last day of projected shipping. other than that the pants are exactly what i expected. not too shiny, fit well (i am a 6 and curvy and got a medium), and aren\\'t too cheaply made considering the price. i\\'m pleasantly surprised after reading such inconsistent reviews. beautiful! i love super cute and comfy, i know they\\'re men\\'s but i love them still, i have big hips so the pockets poke out but that\\'s common when a girl with big hips where\\'s men\\'s sweats. overall great i love this piece so much i just ordered a second one in case something happens to the first.  i ordered this because i am going on an extended vacation with lots of airline miles throughout.  i thought it would be good when stuck in an airplane seat overnight as my private bits would stay private ;  )<br />super comfy, extra soft material, lightweight so it will dry quickly when i wash it out during travel.  the design is so fresh and unique and i can imagine it will be a conversation starter.  looks so cute with red high tops.<br />i am 5\\'6&#34; and weigh 150lbs and it fits me perfectly. the waistband is smooth and is not tight.<br />i can\\'t speak to it\\'s lasting power but for the price it\\'s a steal.<br />shipping takes a while as it came straight from china but i knew that in advance.  definitely worth the wait.  i ordered several other items from this collection and hope they continue to come out with more designs and colors. i waer a size 6 in slacks and by what another reviewer stated i ordered a medium and not a small- that is correct- runs a bit small- also if you are tall this will be too short i am 5\\'5&#34; and they hit at my ankles they are perfect as a pull on look awesome cover-up for beach ,pool or cruise deck!!! exactly fit the bill. good run big so get your correct size. they loosen in a day or so. comfortable but a little large comfortable and easy to wear. good material and super comfortable. durable and cost effective super warm and cozzy it was, and is always, a hit-or-miss type thing when buying clothes online. but, i\\'m happy to say, this brand, fit, style, everything was amazing! so amazing, that i bought three more pairs. i definitely recommend these yoga pants! not many training pants absorb the liquid as well as these pants! we tried 4 other brands, imse vimse are really good. we were going on a 26 hour car ride purchase these to be comfy on the ride they were perfect and still looked decent when we stopped for meals. received this days earlier than predicted.  i ordered the large size, which fit perfectly.  i\\'m currently a 36 inch waist and these pants will comfortably fit anything close to that waist size. great my son really wanted these pants and he is thoroughly pleased.  thank you for having items my family enjoys. so cute this was my first purchase with vivian\\'s fashion. i am 6 foot tall and about 135 to 140 pounds. tall and skinny. i love these yoga pants!  i have finally found yoga pants that are long enough for me! these would be long enough for a women 6\\'3 or 6\\'4 no problem. i first time i put them on, i ran to get my 3 inch heels. they are not see though. i did wash them very carefully, and i still love them today. i have purchased more from vivian\\'s fashions. i would highly recommend them for anyone who knows how hard it is to find (tall/long) pants that fit! thank you! i ordered large as i\\'m 6.2&#34;, it came somewhat large!!!, with somewhat light material, but overall i like it, it\\'s ok for the purpose. perfect so that kids know their wet and they don\\'t like it, and so that you don\\'t have puddles all over your floor, or kitchen chairs, or carseat, ect. they wash real well, i always add vinegar so that they don\\'t stink love it! love them. i\\'m 5\\'9 all legs and a long torso. these are the perfect length these are extremely comfortable. i really enjoy lounging in them. they are a tad long....as a 6ft male who purchased a medium, i think that they are a bit long but certainly not terrible. most certainly worth the buy! pants were as advertised i am a professional woman with a mature body who likes sophisticated, comfortable clothing. i bought the the lotustraders pants gauchos pockets lagenlook osl-2x in black and gray for a trip. the pants exceeded my wildest expectations on every level. they can be dressed up, down and are, frankly, just the \\\\\\\\\"coolest\\\\\\\\\" pants i have ever owned. lotustraders is my new \\\\\\\\\"go to\\\\\\\\\" place to buy clothing. the one piece jump dress (sorry i don\\'t have the item no) is equally as fabulous and functional. i bought it in black. my base colors for the trip were black and gray. these are great for the price. the fabric is thick and kind of heavy so they don\\'t feel like they\\'d rip easily. pockets are deep enough to actually put stuff in and most importantly, they fit as described üôè i love these yoga pants!  i wear them everyday!! speaking from experience as a u.s. army veteran, i can authoritively say that rothco produces a quality civilian product that is about as close as you can get to army issue. the quality of their garments is superb, and i highly recommend it to anyone looking for uniforms. great  product these are the best pants in the world.  i\\'ve bought all three colors of these because they fit great and never wrinkle.  i hope they make a brown pair soon.  i wear a 32-34 &amp; most pants seem to be way too baggy in the crotch b/c no one seems to realize that at that size you\\'re going to be skinny.  cole figured it out.  ***** if you\\'re looking for leak proof training pants, these aren\\'t the right ones. but if you\\'re looking for a high quality, super soft pair of underwear for your little ones, these are fabulous. i was shocked at the quality of other little boys\\' underwear on the market. these are very well made, extremely soft, wash great and look very comfortable. my son\\'s potty trained and i still prefer these to any other underwear. the price on amazon is a bit steep, but still totally worth it. in my experience, they run quite large. my son is 3 1/2 and he\\'s in 2t. he could probably even get away with 12-18 months. so if your kid is slender, definitely size down. these are the best pants i\\'ve ever ordered! ! i just got them and put them on. the fit is fantastic, i love the wide waistband and i love that it is not a fold down band. the fabric is very high quality almost like dress slacks. will be very nice for lounging around or out and about. i\\'m six feet tall & they are perfect length and fit. very happy customer, will be ordering more!! i had to take them up in length, but they did shrink a little after first wash and dry.  very comfortable and good fit.  not too thick and not too thin fabric, light enough for all but the hottest days yet the fleece is warming if it\\'s not quite cold enough to turn on the heater. it\\'s hard to find plus size maternity wear. but these pants are awesome. fit excellent and so comfortable. not sure i will want to give them up after the baby comes! even though it arrived it late due to some delivery problems, i was happy to still have gotten them! they fit great and they make my butt look great ;) will be buying more in the near future! our favorite pj\\'s.  they seem to last longer then any other pj\\'s.  the stretch helps make these pj\\'s last through weight and height growth. i recommend getting at least one pair in every size. i love these pants! i truly can not say enough good things about them.  they are casual in style but yet very versatile.  you can wear these for exercising like a yoga pant, as pajama pants because they are so soft & comfortable or wear them for a day out running errands, etc.  they\\'re extremely lightweight and thin fabric which adds to the comfort of wearing these.  the wide band with drawstring is actually very slimming on the waist as well.  for me personally they fit true to size and because it is a stretchy fabric, you could probably go one size down to get a more form fitting pant if you wanted. i found these to be very complimentary to my figure though and i suspect it would be that way for everyone.  it\\'s just the style of these pants that seem to be very slimming overall and for me at least, it really elongated my legs which was nice.  i ordered these in black and i will say that they\\'re not solid black as it looked in the provided photo (at least not the pair i got).  they\\'re mostly black but they have very subtle grayish specks throughout. i have machine washed & dried my pair several times now and although they did shrink very minimally the first time, it did not affect fit, softness or color. the only minimal shrinking i noticed was in the length so if you\\'re a tall woman and don\\'t want to lose any of that length - i\\'d recommend not fully drying them in the dryer and then gently pulling down on the pant leg because for me that brought the original length back perfectly.  i would highly recommend these eco-heather long pants to anyone and i plan to buy a few more pairs in other colors because they truly do feel so good and fit so well.<br /><br />i sincerely hope this review helps you and if you do order a pair of these - i hope you love them as much as i do! i use these as part of my uniform for grooming dogs, they are somewhat water proof but also they are airy. i don\\'t sweat to death in them and i don\\'t get soaked from washing dogs. note that the sizing info provided informs you of the waist measurements in *inches*, which doesn\\'t directly map onto the normal us waist sizing. i failed to notice this, and ordered a large when i should have ordered medium. size large roughly corresponds to a us mens size 34-35 waist.<br /><br />pros:<br />*an extra layer of fabric stitched onto the front side of the pants.<br />*decent stitching<br />*partially water repellant(due to 45% polyester content)<br />*built-in waste tightener (small, nondescript black strap on both sides between belt loops that can be tightened)<br /><br />cons:<br />*probably won\\'t last too long if regularly dried on high heat (due to 45% polyester) these are for a family member and i believe that she will enjoy wearing them.  the color and fabric are very nice. these were for my 15 year old great grandson.  he loved them.  i had also gotten him an identical pair last year and his mother said they were in the wash every week.....even in the summer.  sounds like he liked them! okay just discovered i went from 5ft 5 to 5ft 2  petites are excellent  no more heming pants super comfy and fits great. i can dress them up and dress them down. they are a super comfortable fabric too. these pants help me to realize what a ripoff nike and other brand name products are.  these are made much better, feel great, fit great and for a fraction of the price.  if i were you, i would go ahead and order two pair before they discontinue them or something. absolutely love them! they material is perfect and extremely comfortable. was skeptical at first, buying pants i couldnt try on, but they stretch comfortably. im anywhere from a size 9 - size 11 depending on the brand, and the 9 is perfect. definitely will be buying this brand from now on. highly reccomend the purchase. perfect fit, nice color and easy to care for.  more expensive than goodwill but new is sometimes the best gift. i do a long workout and these pants keep the sweat away and keep me dry.  great price and eventually will not use my old sweat pants to use these for all of my workouts.  highly recommend this product. love it perfect it\\'s cool they are great, and comfortable and i never realized how little my legs were till now. i was always wearing baggy pants great pants, i highly recommend them. never goes out of style.  one isn\\'t going to be enough!  fits to size, versatile, makes your american aparrel onesies look well thought out.<br /><br />just perfect when it\\'s 100 degrees every day. they resemble pajama pants but everyone loved them as well. i paired it with a black shirt and flip flops! prosavings are the best with their delivery and customer service. they are prompt or faster than the delivery time and if you had any questions, they will call you within hour or faster. they want customers\\' satisfaction.... wonderful material, soft to the touch, beautiful flowing pants!  love them! love these pants! frog togs pants: water proof. plain simple down-pour wear. zip at hem fits over light duty hiking boots easily. elastic at hem does keep the hem out of the bike chain. leg-swish is relatively quiet. tall enough for 5\\'9. that seems about the middle of their height range. the elastic at waist and hem make them pretty adaptable, but for biking if you may get wet ankles if are over 5\\'11. no pockets  or access slots at all but the waist is easy enough to reach through. wife looks great in them.  i will by her more soon.  they are smooth and look very comfortable. great buy these pants are so ninja that after i bought them i could not find them‚Ä¶but that was because my mom took them great pants just what i wanted they were what i was expecting i already new what size i needed for these pants. i\\'m supper skinny but i need a large because i have super long legs. they are still tight. love it. they are the best pants. so comfortable. i got medium and it was too large but of course i don\\'t mind, how could i?? these pants are awesome!! they may be thin, but they are extremely comfortable! plus they have pockets!!  overall a fantastic product! :) i love this shirt! so many complements i might buy 1 more whatever you searched on amazon found you these.  yes, you should buy these.  i have bought many things on amazon, these were bought for me.  i have been wearing them for many days in a row.  i wish i had two so that i could wear them wall they are in the wash.<br />i normally wear a medium (31 waste), but these are a large.  i am 6 ft. and they barely touch the bottom of my foot without shoes on.  it is easy to roll, but that makes them tighter.  the parachute part is perfect.  and the material is breathable and easy to move if you were going to work out.  but i have also worn them in 15 degree weather (i\\'m not saying i was toasty though).<br />the pockets do not stand out or get in the way.  easy access.  i was worried because my galaxy note 2 is impossible to get in and out of pants with the case on.  but i wear these pants just because of how easy it is and how nice they feel.<br />finally.. merica oopsie kept me in my non-maternity pants longer and more comfortably than any other strategy i have tried.  i wish i had discovered this product in my earlier pregnancies!  so much more comfortable, cute and dependable than rubber bands.  as the mom of 4, i recommend oopsie loopsie to any expectant mom that\\'s not quite ready to give up her favorite pair of jeans. he was able to wear these until well after he\\'d graduated into carter\\'s 9 month and gerber\\'s12month (at the same time).  our narrow hipped child managed to get too long before he got too wide. he could fit in them the same time as his other 9 month pants, but they lasted longer. beautiful quality. i read the previous reviews before i purchased.  the paints fit as expected.  the waist is small.  i ordered a large.  i am a size 10-12.  i am also short and the length is very long on me. beautiful frozen outfit. yes, bought matching hoodie!!! these pj\\'s are perfect for average temperatures and oh so very soft. i wish they made them in my size! i needed these for a costume and they were exactly what i needed. they aren\\'t thin, but not bulky either. comfortable. i am 5\\'1\\\\\\\\\" so unfortunately they are too long for me even though i went with a small. there are no pockets and you can see underwear underneath! (thankfully this didn\\'t matter because my costume covered that) but otherwise only wear them at home. 3-6 may be good size for an average baby, but if your baby is 90% and higher it is more suitable for infants 2-3 months. i ordered both the hot pants and matching zipper bras of these items<br />got them in white, yellow, blue, pink, black, & red<br /><br />i use them in my photography studios, and the models love them<br /><br />for the one size that fits all, well just make sure you are using the right size model<br />some models should not be wearing form fitting clothing.<br /><br />over all they were a great addition to my photography studio wardrobe.<br /><br />hope they get more colors in...<br /><br />photographer:kirby<br />bigeasystudios.biz these pants are perfect for my wife.  i bought the 14p short and they fit perfect.  my wife is 5\\' 4\\\\\\\\\" with short legs so pants are hard to find, but these are the best..  she told me they feel great!<br /><br />i only have two complaints.  the first is this. this is the second time we purchased these pants the first being a year ago.  i looked at the old pair to see the size we purchased earlier.  the tag inside the pants just reads 14p, nothing about \\\\\\\\\"short\\\\\\\\\".  i ordered the 14p \\\\\\\\\"short\\\\\\\\\" on a hope.  luckily i was right.  when i got the pants i checked the label, sure enough it also read 14p (nothing about short)  the paperwork was the only thing that mentioned short.  please consider marking these \\\\\\\\\"14ps\\\\\\\\\" or putting \\\\\\\\\"short\\\\\\\\\" somewhere in the pants,keeping all the paperwork is a pain.<br /><br />the second is this; i just went back to order one more pair for her and the size is no longer available.  when will the size be available again? the matrial very good but the size same to large good quality product. for the price i thought these pants were going to end up being like see through panty hose.  they weren\\'t.  the quality was surprisingly good! i like the joggers the only thing i thought they had pockets i would\\'ve luv that extra addition but other than that there nice. i have looked all over for these kind of pants. love the pants my wonderful hairdresser gave me this pair of pants when i became a new grandmother. it\\'s almost 3 years later and i\\'m still loving them. they are the most comfortable, friendly and distinctively fun lounging pants i own.  winter blues disappear when i put these cozy babies on.  now my little granddaughter says to me, \\\\\\\\\"mammaw, i like your pants.\\\\\\\\\"  wow!!  without a doubt, one of the best gifts i\\'ve ever gotten!  big and roomy; warm; comfy with a capital c--and fun!  the pockets are a nice feature too.  would definitely recommend them to grandmothers and non-grandmothers alike! i ordered them larger because i thought i wouldnt have been able to fit them. but i like them how they are because i can pull them up like high waist pants. these pants looked exactly like the picture. came two days earlier than expected which is great. i love these pants. they\\'re really comfortable. :) great product...well made, comfortable, accurate size, breathes well yet keeps off the chill. the foot loops are just a little long for my thin feet so they slide toward the heel. highly recommend. i\\'ve warn them on a few 3-5 mile run at temps between 35-45 degrees and i thought they were perfect. these pants are cool. i unfortunately ordered the wrong size, so i cannot wear them much without being afraid they will fall off lol. the texture wasnt as awesome as i thought it would be, and they wrinkle up fast. i still wear them though, just got to take special care of them. look exactly as shown. great quality for the gloves and the clothes. the headband on top looked a little plain but it wasnt a deal breaker.great product for the price. my 3 year old wears this everyday.  we bought it to replace the other dora the explorer sweatshirt that was misplaced they are fantastic!  very comfortable fit. i got these to go to a football game in the 30\\'s and sit in a stadium for 4 hours.  they worked great, were comfortable and warm and had handy pockets as well. i love these pants/jumper..worth the money and it looks like you spent more.  i bought a second color after getting them other than being a bit large for the stated size, i am completely happy with these pants.  they are extremely comfortable! the pant s fit as well as any army issue black sweats. i was actually suprised. they also give that since of military style i became accustomed to while serving in the army. this was a wise purchase for me. perfect fit didn\\'t think i would like elastic waistband pants but they are really nice. very nice hat! i just love it<br />nice quality, washes well, looks just great!<br />my son looks lovely in it super soft and very beautiful. recieved one day after the shipping email. perfect fit great pants for my little girl\\'s dance. the pants fit nice and are very comfortable. the material is sturdy not flimsy. nice product. my daughter was very pleased with the pants fits perfect great material love love love this!<br />shipped on time great for potty training at night so my son knows when he has gone. i\\'m 5\\'5 and 130lbs, usually wear size 3-5, and i ordered size s. it seemed so tiny and the fabric was softer than i expected(like the other reviewer said, it is not jeans or regular cotton pants), but..i tried it on, woooooow, it fit me so good! very comfortable, and my butt looked great!!!!!! i was slightly worried anouth the strength of the fabric, so i contacted to the seller and she responsed me in a second and wiped my worry off. in fact, i worked in it all days long(parts of my work are loading/unloading heavy boxes and opening/closing canopy) but this pants kept the style, never be loose or tore. i\\'m more than happy with it!!!!! i love them!! fits just like i like them. low rise is awesome. i looked all over for training pants and found them here. they arrived fast and fit perfectly. my daughter loves prancing around in them. thanks for helping in the potty training process. will come back to shop. :) this was a gift for my boyfriend for christmas, they fit perfectly and he loved them! looks exactly as it does in picture. well made product. looks great great price my daughter loves it. it\\'s colors vibrant and the graphics are clear. it adjusts easily and doesn\\'t slide out of size while she wears it. these fit and feel great. excellent product good fit.....happy with the pants...... very good and very comfortable given the previous reviews about them being super thin i wasn\\'t expecting these to be anything more than around-the-house pants so i wasn\\'t disappointed. they are pretty thin (i personally wouldn\\'t be comfortable wearing them in public) but they are super soft and comfy for warmer weather. for the price i paid for them, i\\'m pleased :) will be ordering more. i bought two pairs and i love them. im ordering a pair for every day of the week if you\\'re like me, you love wild leggings. i own many, many pairs that i\\'ve bought from different places on amazon.  i must say, these are literally the best i\\'ve found. they fit well, stretch well, are long enough for my 5\\'10&#34; frame, and the pattern doesn\\'t distort when stretched.  plus, they\\'re super soft. best leggings i have found for their price, ever.  highly recommend. love the fit of these pants. this is my 3rd pair! i would order a size larger thou. i love them to death but , i thought they would be thicker and more fitting on the bottom but they\\'re more like pajama pants . great pants!!! front sits a little higher then expected my husband loves these pants,and although somewhat large he said they are very comfy. its lightweight so in the desert heat its not too hot to wear i got these for my daughter and she loves them and looks so cute in them!! be aware they are more for someone that has a shorter stature she is 5\\'4 and they fit perfect i am 5,7 and they are more like capris on me!! if you are just starting potty training, because your child refuses to wear diapers, then these are for you.  they will hold in a pee event (with some wetness on the legs), as opposed to regular undies, which leave you with a puddle on the floor.  we also use cloth diapers, so we wash these training pants with the diapers. i like the fit and the fabric but there is a strange odor in the garment. it smells a little like fuel oil. i have been airing the leggings out. hopefully that will so the trick. other than the smell i really like them comfortable and style good i love these leggings!!!!! i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; about 116 pounds (usually a size 6 us pants) and they fit great! the color is really vibrant! i got these when i was 2. i like that i can take them up and pull them down all by myself when i go to the potty. they are comfortable and they fit good.i like the red cars with black wheels on the ones  i have. if i use the potty before bed time i get to wear these instead of pull up diapers and now i am a big boy. i am 3 and i am still wearing them. my friend has the same ones but his mother gave them to me because he grew faster than i did. good i am 5\\'5, 133 lbs and bought the xl and i needed that. they run small, but what a fit. looking forward to wearing these all summer long. sexy fit and they do not show through. the material is a nice stretch and not bulky. these are a very nicely made.  great fit and love the color brown.  this past summer i bought a few different colors and they all fit wonderfully.  great for the money. this is a wonderful outfit. the color is cute. the fabric, like all their clothes, is very soft and stretchy. the size of this outfit does run a bit small. the clothes fit like tights so they are much more form fitting. well designed. good quality. good price. my grand daughter loves it. thank you is a good pant, i feel good. its a good feature, high quality, better never will be found. thanks. bye i am 5\\'4&#34;, 136lbs. these fit well and are very soft. they faded slightly after a few washes. the price was good.<br />not sure if i got an end piece of fabric, but the left leg has the name of the print, &#34;aztec vector set&#34; printed on it. no one else would notice, probably. just thought it was odd. when they say one size fits all, they mean it! i\\'m a pear shaped woman with a 16-18 pant size and these harem pants are absolutely fantastic. because they have so much room in the leg area, it doesn\\'t matter how big or small your legs are, these pants will fit. the fabric is a little thinner than expected, but other than that the pants are excellent! we bought both the pink & blue varieties for our daughter as she started the potty-training adventure.  she loves the soft feel and that they don\\'t \\\\\\\\\"creep\\\\\\\\\" like so many of the thin cotton bikini/briefs for girls have a tendency to do (every woman out there knows what i\\'m talking about!).  we, as her parents, love that if there\\'s an accident, it\\'s not immediately on the floor/couch/chair as the thick, absorbent center panel catches the bulk of the mess.  now we\\'re moving into the nighttime training and we\\'re looking forward to her being able to not soak everything and yet feel the wetness if she does have an accident at night (which is inevitable to start!).  they wash up and hold their shape really well and the colors/prints have not faded out in nearly 18 months of use.  here\\'s to hoping they hold up for our 20 mo. old son\\'s toilet-training exploits. these shorts are very comfortable great quality i love them!! love, love, love. cant wait to wear this. quality was much better than i expected. i usually wear a us size 2 but i ordered a medium. wise choice. highly recommend. my lord these are comfy. just look at the title of this review! i wear these pants when i play assassins creed iv with my fiance and i can tell that when i put them on my sex appeal increases 7 fold. when i wear these pants flowers smell better, sandwiches taste better and fiances find you sexier. 5 stars! buy it! buy two! do they have a smaller size for my ferociously attractive lady?! cause that would be gat-dang adorable. i am satisfied with my purchased. warm and cozy these are more expensive than your average pair of baby\\'s pajamas, but they are soooo soft. these are softer than any pajamas i have or have come across. i bought a size larger, so my baby hasn\\'t worn these yet, but i can only imagine he\\'ll appreciate the softness too :) definite luxury for baby. if your going to splurge on something, soft baby pajamas are worth it. these fit snug at first and then stretch to accommodate your body perfectly. will order more in the future.  a little pricey. good product though. tis my 2nd pair, if you need help in improvement to shape, try these. this is my 2nd pair, i wore out my first after 2 yrs of washing repeatedly. these shorts aren\\'t at all what i was expecting, however, i like them!  first you should be aware that these are junior sizing!  i suspected this from the style and cut and elected to size up which was a good call.  for reference, i‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 ~ 145# ~ 34b bust 28‚Äù waist 34‚Äù and typically wear a size 6/8 in jeans.  i\\'d usually order a small in a bottom with an elastic waist but ordered a medium - they just fit with a little wiggling into them.  i would recommend sizing up at least one size.  the cut is very flattering.  the inside of the shorts is slightly longer than the outside which provides a degree of modesty for the bum and inner thighs and  keeps these from being &#34;mom&#34; shorts.  i purchased the mint floral and it\\'s a bright fun print,  lightweight and silky.  the fabric will likely require hand washing.  overall i\\'m very happy with these purchase and would buy another pair :) quality is decent and the fabric is comfy. but the sizes are wayyyy off for men. 2xl fits like a smallish large. still at the price i\\'ll probably just reorder a bigger size. i love these pants.  i ordered another pair i liked them so much.  nice and cool! this is my second pair of these pants.  they wear well and they come out of the dryer ready to wear.  they don\\'t shrink and are comfortable for long days.  stock up on these! the pants are very comfy and fit as expected.  a couple of other reviews mentioned the length so was prepared.  i ordered a l and am 5\\'5\\'\\'.<br /><br />other than that am very satisfied with the fit. love this! the material is so soft and durable, i have washed these many times and it still looks new! the little butt flap on the back is more for looks than function, but i had already assumed that. my little guy looks so cute in it! comfortable! as covered by a previous reviewer, the buttons are not sewn on very well.  i had the buttons reinforced before wearing the pants and had no problems with buttons.  i have a 34 waist and ordered the medium which is supposed to accomodate 34 to 36 inch waists.  if you are a 34, i recommend ordering the large and the fit should be less snug.  fabric seems pretty heavy, we will see how durable over time.  the ordering process and delivery were very satisfactory. i bought these to walk the dog in during our cold wisconsin winters - love them. they seem very well made, fit great and super warm. for the price this is an incredible buy - highly suggest them to all my friends. spectacular this shorts is great looking. the way finishing and pattern made is very nice. not that typical shirts, these are very well made and color is nice too. sometimes actual color is little dull and material is cheap too but there is nothing like that in this shorts.  warning: just order yourself a size or two higher than you normally wear. if you wear us 32 then order 34 and it will be fine. i received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. very sexy !! love it extremely comfortable, well proportioned.  the lightweight fabric is great for warmer weather.  there\\'s lots of fabric in the waistband so you can adjust it for the look you want. i really like the high waist and the flowing fabric. they are just a tad too long, but i prefer that over being too short. very nice quality and the material is very soft. graphics look awesome and the shipping was super fast. very happy with purchase. this is a very cool invention, to have leggings where you don\\'t need to worry about your top being long enough to cover your backside. the material is thick and warm. i am 5\\'4, 120 pounds, and the asian xl fit nicely, even though it is hard to believe a petite person like me would need an xl size! my complaints however: 1) the seam on leg was not sewn well. after only one wear, a hole developed on the leg seam. i sewed it back up and now it is fine, but i shouldn\\'t have to do this on a brand new product. 2) the legs are not full length. if you wear higher boots it\\'s not a problem, but they look like &#34;high waters&#34; if you\\'re wearing with lower shoes. overall, i like this product. but it does have some significant shortcomings. i plan to wash/dry by hand to avoid more holes in the fabric, since the seams can rip very easily.<br /><br />update 2/08/15: i loved the concept so i bought a 2nd pair, in grey this time. the black ones ran short and developed many holes along seams. i wrote to the company to complain about this, and they said they\\'d be more careful in the future. the grey pair i bought recently (same size, xl) were longer and sewn better. no holes so far. i did go over the seams with grey thread to prevent any future holes, but i have not seen any developing. despite the shortcomings with the first pair, i\\'d say this is a very nice product to own. just be gentle with them! i purchased these pants for work and they are fabulous. i got big fast so i was wearing them from about my 17th week and they are still my most comfortable piece of maternity clothing at 30weeks. i also purchased other pants from old navy in the recommended size and they are really snug and uncomfortable now.<br /><br />i would recommend these pants in every colour you can get. excelente producto these scrub pants fit my small frame perfectly!  i am 5\\'4\\', 31 inch inseam and 118 pounds.  they (size xs) are fitted without being tight.  the material is very comfortable and workmanship seems great.  i haven\\'t had them long enough to know how they\\'ll hold up to frequent washings but the seams look like they should do fine.  the stitching is very nice.  a crisp, professional look and the elastic/drawstring waist is very comfortable. love these pjs! i ordered these because my other pair of yoga pants were kind of old and i was just browsing on amazon and fount these for a good price. they arrived very quickly and fit me perfectly. i\\'ll definitely be getting more! daughter loves them love these pants, so soft, comfortable, just really long love them! have not worn yet......too cold in mt. right now........but perfect fit! exactly what i thought i was getting ! i reviewed sizing per previous customers......therefore i ordered an xl......i am 5\\'5&#34; and 154#. hope that helps with your sizing choice ! they are not see through. they have a nice, high waist (so you don\\'t have to worry about your bottom falling out). the seams are done in white thread instead of something more neutral (which is why i ranked it 4 stars instead of 5). i did have to contact customer service, but they were very easy to work with and had fast communication regarding my issue. i am 5\\'5&#34;, 125 lbs, and these fit me. i am 5\\'5&#34; 125 lbs. there is quite a bit more room at the ankle, so i suspect a taller person would also be able to wear these. received the item today. out of the bag there was already a hole on the front because the stitching is not done well, and i also had to take many pieces of thread from the pants. if you are over 5\\'10&#34; they might fit very weird and tight, even if you are slender. i mean, if i want to bend over my butt will fall out. good idea and the item is very interesting, but it definitely needs some work and they really have to redesign the pants so they fit better!  edited march 10th, 2015  received a message from the seller who sent me a new pair of pants because the ones that i ordered were damaged. new ones look fine, and luckily they fit better from the first ones. i will enjoy wearing them. thank you to the seller for resolving the issue, hence - more stars in the review :) these were just what i was looking for! they are comfortable and go great with just about anything. i bought a pair of these last year from a local store and loved them. of course when i went back they were no longer selling them so i decided to buy them from amazon. i am fairly petite and i like that they do not drag the ground or look excessively baggy. i weigh 115 and bought several colors in xs. the fit perfectly and actually wear better the more times they are washed. the colors also hold up surprisingly well after probably 40+ washes. wow! simply an amazing design for both boy and girl. it looks great and is such an adorable set. such a great purchase. fabulous service and product!!!  i love them!! i initially bought these to go paint-balling up in the mountains.  i had never gone paint-balling before so i decided to get these pants.  these pants are so comfortable that i ended up wearing them the whole time i was up there (3 days) the only time i took them off was when i was going to sleep.  these things are comfy and do not hinder your movement like jeans do.<br /><br />i have taken them camping 4 times now and they do their job every time.  i have rubbed them against sharp edges, trees, rocks and not a single hole on them. they take abuse like no other.<br /><br />my only problem is that the dye fades way too quick, on my pants they\\'re more noticeable on the knees and butt area which are the parts that get the most use when i go camping; however i still give them 5 stars because i never expected them to be so comfy and durable.<br /><br />i even recommend them for work if you work in heavy duty areas like construction.  you don\\'t have to get the camo version, propper also offers plain navy blue, khaki colors and such.  highly recommended. my daughter loved these and they look very nice on can\\'t even tell there leggings. cute this was a halloween costume for my grandson.  loved but he never got to enjoy it because he was sick love them! perfect length. didn\\'t give a 5 because the bottoms are a little larger (more flared) than appears in the picture. runs small but the material stretches so it\\'s ok this dress is so cute, super soft and a little slinky.  it runs a little big, but i knew that so i ordered a size down and it\\'s perfect, i like these pants a lot. i wish they were a little lighter in color but they fit great. the material is much better than regular yoga pants because it seems thicker. even though they are a better material they also keep you from sweating as much as thinner material. i\\'m pretty short and these pants are really long at first but after a few wash and dries they fit perfectly. fit as expected qood quality i absolutely love these pants.  so much so that i ordered a second pair.  they are nice and full and will be most cool for the summer!  thank you lotustraders for providing such stylish clothing for the plus size lady!!  thank you again. love these! so sexy and comfy. i am constantly looking for pants for my dad, and i purchased these through amazon. i had to alter the bottom hems for my dad\\'s height, and the fabric was easy to work with. my dad tried the pants on yesterday, and he\\'s thrilled with them. he likes the fabric because it\\'s soft and breathable. my only suggestion for wyndham pointe is that i wish they had these in navy blue, too. love! pants are what i expected, just needed something with a ripper in the front, classy enough to go to the store with and very warm. great purchase, bought as a gift these fit nicely and are light and silky. i get hot when i dance so i wanted something light. i\\'ve been looking for some nice harem pants, ones that aren\\'t too huge, but have the expected fullness, and aren\\'t too long in the crotch. they are sheer, expect to need to wear them under a skirt or something unless you are giving a private show (wink).<br /><br />these are exactly right. i would buy them again in a heartbeat. works perfectly as expected. i am 5\\'4&#34; and it went to mid calf. fits great waist line is too big but the rest fits perfect! can just wear a belt and it\\'s just fine =) these pants are way comfy!! the colors are vibrant and there was not any bleeding in the wash!!  will most likely get another pair or two!! perfect for yoga and slouching around. excellence maintained after washing. will get more! i wish amazon would pick these up so i didn\\'t have to buy through a 3rd party.  these are fantastic! i own two pairs. the 504 is a bit loose, so i\\'m going to try the 511 next time. they wick away sweat, they have a reinforced crotch, and they stretch slightly for comfort.  all jeans should be this way.  the pants of the future. i\\'m in love with these pants! i want to marry these pants! they are so comfy and everyone loves them. i dress them up all the time. but if you don\\'t they kind of look like pjs. i\\'m kind of short so i step on the bottoms. but i really do love these pants! a little too shinny but besides the that great pair of pants!! love this company, the gifts that i purchased was received well, and much appreciated. the quality is good. i recommend this. i can not really state the fit, but the parents said it was fine. i actually ordered these pants on bewild.com and their stitching is white. for $10 less these pants are worth it. they have more detail decoration than most tripp pants i see these days and the fact that they are cheaper than the ones with less decoration on them it\\'s a steal. i do suggest that if you do order tripp pants dont order them right before new years slows down the delivery date. but other than that no complaints. of all the tripp pants i have these are my favorite. they fit perfectly, not too baggy at all, and they have a real light fit to them. i have ordered tripp pants online before and i have noticed that the stiching does come off over time, unlike the ones i bought at hot topic. the reason behind that may be that they have changed the way they make tripp pants or they just wear after washing for a while. but these i like the best. if you do order these, or any other tripp pants for that matter, i highly suggest you do not put them in the dryer. either air dry then iron, air dry then dewrinkle, or send them to the cleaners. they do make alot of noise in the dryer which could damage both the dryer and the pants. one last sugeestion dont wear the bottoms of your tripp pants while riding a bike learned that lesson the hard way. but other than that one of the better products of tripp. bought a second pair of these after my 1st purchase.  could not believe how comfortable they are and am 4\\'10 1/2&#34; and do not need to hem them ......i would live in them if i could get my job to buy off on it.  well worth the money and are well made these pants are the most comfortable pants i have ever worn and the legs are very stylish. i will warn you though, the fabric is very thin, so if you live in a cold area, beware. awesome otherwise! very stretchy! fit as expected and kids love them. perfect awesome present nice fit. these are for my mother and i think that she will really like wearing them. the fabric and color are nice, i bought this as a gift for a friend and she loves it. these pants actually run a tad larger than leggings i typically buy. the waist is high so it covers my mid section as well, which is a plus for the purpose of these pants. these pants don\\'t win any style points but they aren\\'t horrid either. i have not tried other neoprene pants to compare these with. for the most part, they are easy to move in (doesn\\'t quite feel like you\\'re in a wet suit), they are a little squeaky and air gets trapped as you heat up. i would recommend this product based on cost and functionality. they definitely make you sweat. i just got these yesterday... the image is slightly blurry but not enough to complain about. i was fretting about how they\\'d fit after reading reviews how many said they were too tight... i tried mine on and they fit great in the hips, butt area, and mid thigh... but after that they\\'re huge on me.. i have to pull them up and roll the waist down to get them to look right on me. i\\'m 4\\'11 and about 93 lbs and these lovelies are loose on me.. i hope they will shrink if i toss email in the dryer... still wearable but i\\'m not complaining. it\\'s a real feat to find pants that are both attractive and comfortable and affordable, these pants fit the bill. this is an excellent casual pant buy. it also is an easy care product.  they are very comfortable to wear. review by mrs. mara:<br />i really had my doubts about these pants, but to my amazement, i really like them even though they\\'re a bit tight, even in large. i\\'m 5\\'8&#34; with very long legs and was really surprised how long these pants\\' legs are, just right for me! they\\'re tight through the butt and thighs, but they were only meant for me to wear them around the house. they are very very comfortable and flexible. i plan to only wash them in cold water so that they don\\'t shrink. perfect i just wore these out with my family to the movies.  they are fabulous and fit perfect!  why am i so excited?  because i also got some harem pants from a seller in china and the china crap in a men\\'s xl was a true kids size 6.  ** finally a seller i can depend upon to tell the truth.  bravo.** wonderful pants my girlfriend got alot of attention it\\'s hard for me to find pants that fit comfortably since i have narrow hips. this is definitely junior size. great for me! very nice pants. looked amazing on. the moment you wash them the color fades. good quality and comfortable for my toddler.  he can be picky about how clothing feels so we\\'re glad he was willing to wear them without hassle. pants came in really quick. at first i was a little skeptical about the price and quality but in my opinion the quality of these pants is worth more than what u pay for nowadays. i will definitely be ordering more in different colors. they are extremely comfortable and quite warm. i ordered a large, fit me well but was not as loose i usually have when i get a size that is true large. so they might fit a bit in the smaller side of their size. overall, i really love these pants! i love them fit nice and like in the picture the pants fit well.  they were just what i ordered.  they seem to hold up very well.  color doesn\\'t fade. i love these leggings/ jeggings! they really look like jeans! my butt looks amazing in them and the waistband is perfect, no muffin tops!!! i\\'d like to clarify that i\\'m not a &#34;kennydanger&#34; as the post suggests. i\\'m his girlfriend. and i\\'m currently 13 weeks pregnant. right now, my waist is 31&#34; and my hips are 38&#34;, and i ordered and received a medium. the fabric is thick, perfectly constricting, but completely breatheable. they\\'re a little long, but i\\'m all for it. it seriously fits amazingly well. and the fact that it\\'s the tiniest bit too loose than my liking (which i\\'m sure the dryer could help with), it\\'s perfect for pregnancy because a) the fold down gray segment is comfortable pulled all the way up and b) folding the gray segement down is comfortable, as well, so much so that it doesn\\'t create any uncomfortable feeling around my hips.<br /><br />all in all, i\\'m happy with this purchase. in fact, i\\'m gonna order another one! success! i do like them for the price. use them for yoga and feel pretty comfortable. so far they been trough few washes but still look and feel good! love this slim cargo pants, modern and sexy, not like other maternity pants with the saggy bottom, these are my new fave! i purchased for heavier wt to use during the winter. i gave it a 4 star because they have to be hemmed. i love these pants.  i like the way they fit around the waist and hips. there is no pocket bulge. i normally wear a size 12 and large fits good. i have these in navy and black. perfectly fit, and i love this color. it was a good purchase standard issue ben\\'s: love the fit, and after numerous wear and washings, they become exceedingly comfortable. i love it. my son loves it.<br />fit as expected.<br />and the color is great too.<br />(the outfit is a bit expensive though..) these are well made and hold their color well (black in my case).<br />plenty of pocket room yet not too large that you must fish around for your wallet like another manufacturers. the scrubs are comfortable but the tops run a little smaller. good color didnt bleed when i washed them i was very pleased with this outfit. the pieces were well made and very attractive. i will be buying more from this clothing line in the future. the skirt is great if you are looking for extra length.  i am tall, so it was a little short and lost it\\'s shape around my ankles.  in spite of that, i will more than likely purchase more.  the elastic tends to fold around the waist.  still plan on purchasing more!  i have been looking for skirted leggings for a while, and am so thankful to have found one with a longer skirt! i purchased two sets of these in a large. they are more like a medium. so ended up giving both sets to my daughter. she loves them. they are super comfy and really nice looking. just make sure to order up a size! very comfortable this is my second pair getting ready to purchase third love the look & feel of these! i am 5\\'8&#34; and about 130lb & ordered a medium- perfect fit! i\\'m glad i read the reviews & ordered a size bigger than normal or they\\'d be a tad bit tight and may be too short! the color pop and the fit is so comfortable...i ordered a large but a medium came instead lucky the fit was perfect so i don\\'t have to send it back...the price was not expensive and i will order a different color next time... got these for 80\\'s night for a convention.  came as one size.  i normally wear an xs/s and these were a little bit but with the leg warmers and leotard on top, i made them work.  they did hold up to washing/drying too but i haven\\'t tried on since to see if the shrunk or not. great wading pants! happy i let my daughter pick out the cute underwear to get excited about potty training but i can\\'t tell you how often i was cleaning the run or a floor out in public.  it took me about a month or two to find these and i love them!!! they are awesome! they don\\'t hold it all in of course and i do carry extra shorts/pants since they get wet buuuut it doesn\\'t always go down her legs and onto the floor. i highly reccomend these!!! i just wish they were a bit cheaper but i still would pay the price! i love these yoga pants!  perfect fit. love these pants! versatile and comfortable yes, yes, yes, finally a harem pant with beautiful print exactly as pictured. cool, breathable fabric, ordered 2 pair one pink peacock and the yellow peacock print. wearing these with sandals, or moccasins sip on shoes. they are one size, fits most. perfect! i was looking for a higher quality pant, these are just like the pair i would normally buy for $10, but they are new so they dont have the &#34;washed too many times black&#34; color.. ha ha..they fit nice though - i am 5\\'9&#34; and 160 with curves in the hips - a large fits me great! the lizatard was a gift for my granddaughter\\'s birthday. she was very excited with her new lizatard as she is a young gymnast. well made and quick to arrive. it is very light and pretty. the fabric feels soft and nice.  i like the pattern and the color. it\\'s very transparent, though. nice pant for the money these leggings fit as expected.  the \\'scales\\' are super shiny, but not as tacky as you might think. it looks like lots of tiny sequins have been attached. the elastic seems to fit well at the waist and i do not foresee any sagging there. the leggings are not see through you really don\\'t have to worry about that. you may have to worry about vpl though, depending on what kind of underwear you wear with them. so far they are very comfortable and look great. ordered these as spares to use at daycare. they\\'ve turned out to be some of our favorite pants to throw on over a onesie. such a comfortable runner, so well made and very comfortable. like the materials and the styling. would buy a 2nd pair for sure. a little flimsy material. ran slightly small but hey it was for a halloween costume and held up well!! awesome awesome fit. several women i know love the fit, too.  dockers called it the ideal fit. it \\'was\\'.  they stopped making them for what i believe is now the metro pant..,  yea- don\\'t like em.  bring back the sydney pant, dockers! these harem pants look and fit just as expected, and i love the coloring and design. at first i was a bit concerned that the front would look see-through, since the material is much thinner than i expected, almost sheer. fortunately, it is mainly the darker background behind the red designs that is thin, so the red pattern keeps the front from being overly see-through. i love the details and the color contrasts, and material is light and comfortable to wear. these pants are great for anyone who likes wearing harem pants that are more colorful and eye-catching. ok being fairly new to bellydance, i was browsing for the right beginner\\'s type of costume. i just lost 65 pounds and i am dancing to firm up and shape up... so, i wanted a top that would cover my upper arms, but still be cool enough when the music heated up.     i was totally amazed at the quality, feel and fit of this costume.. and the price is certainly right! most of the other costumes i checked out from bellydancing websites were way beyond what i could afford to spend.    i highly recommend this item! it\\'s good pants, simple and convenient. i love these so much that i am going to order another pair! i only wish they had them in petite because i am 5 foot and they are a bit too long on me. just a bit snug.  looks like it will hold up well. as an avid shutter bug i spend a lot of time in rough terrain shooting landscapes and wildlife. these pants are rugged, very comfortable and the cargo pockets provide plenty of room for energy bars, my ipod, a water bottle, lens caps, notebook etc. i just love this brand! most of the clothes i buy my baby  she grows out of them so fast. with this brand she wears them for months. it\\'s super comfy and super cute! don\\'t hesitate on buying from this brand looks and feel great very soft and comfortable, ideal for baby. gift for wife. she loves it! i love all things kickee pants!  if you have not discovered them yet, as a parent, listen up!  i am unmarried with no kids and they are my go to gift for baby showers!  they have the wow factor as they are made of the softest material you\\'ve ever felt.  they even have a few adult items for moms.  this set is especially darling with little bunnies.  it has a matching stroller blanket, and those blankets are also the softest things ever!!!  if you buy kickee pants and are not satisfied?  i would be shocked.  seriously. i love these jeggins couldn\\'t ask for anything better. they are thick and fit just like jeans but have the comfort of yoga pants. i usually buy large so i got a large and they fit perfect. they make my rear look nice and perky like if i work out hard for my rear at the gym. i will gladly be ordering more. worth every penny!! very comfortable & light . and most wonderfully sexy . u can flaunt ur hard earned leg muscles &  manly physique . most unique design - hugs body & allows free movement for full range of excercise . also suitable for sweat environment , just bought additional 3 pcs( thinking this great outfit will be out of stock soon). thank you n2n - a quality product . i own two pairs, about to buy a third. they look so nice on that they don\\'t even look like sweat pants. plus they\\'re comfy and i love that they taper at the legs and are skinny from the knee down. the top is kind of like harem pants, giving a nice flare to it. only draw back? pilling. i have a pill shaver, so i just mow them down. but i have worn them soooo much pilling did become an issue. so look out for that. they\\'re thick, which adds a bit to the non-sweatpants looking sweat pants. they\\'re like dress sweatpants. love them. i absolutely love these pants. extremely comfortable and true to size. i\\'m 5\\'4, 140lbs and i got a large and love how they fit. the tiger got tons of attention and everyone loved it. perfect to dance in if you\\'re a dancer. would have given it a 5star but the material started to look linty the longer i wore it. after the slowest shipping wait i ever experienced ordering from amazon these pants finally came in, a day after the latest date expected to be at my house. i am 5\\'8, 140 lbs and these fit pretty well. the fabric is thin but not as bad as other yoga pants i\\'ve come across. the length is really extra long! i can never find yoga pants that are long enough. sometimes they are just about long enough when i buy them, but not after a couple washes, so these should be great! i ordered a medium and had a few extra inches still left under my feet! between the price (a little expensive if you ask me considering the material is thin), the slow shipping speed (and they charge for shipping!) and more length than i need i probably wouldn\\'t order another pair but i\\'ll keep the ones i have.<br />5/15/13 i wanted to edit my review. i searched high and low for other yoga pants comparable in price and there is nothing out there for us taller girls. ive ordered others/tried on others in the store and nothing can beat these for finally finding a long enough length, assorted colors and decent price. i ended up ordering 2 more pairs. i\\'ll wait a little longer if thats what it takes to get something that actually fits good. they\\'ve been through the wash 3 times now and the fabric is holding up fine, there\\'s no shrinkage and they fit like day 1. cool pants so soft, warm and comfy. love the pants. i  a size 8...5\\'7....148 ponds. i bought the large due to feed back. a little lose but its okay....i conduct audits on prison units so i need something comfortable but looks nice..great buy and i received it early...maybe 5 days....plan to order more.... satisfied but they are really really long.  i am very short....only about 5\\'1&#34;, but these are easily 5 or 6 inches too long.  paid to have them shortened because i like them.  but be forewarned. just beware on the first wash i thought i could wash it with whites but some of the color ran and all my whites became pink. also the side pocket has a hole that\\'s why i gave only 4 stars. i get plenty of compliments when i wear them in brazil. this shipped fast and was deliver fast! the pants fit exactly as i expected them to, and the material is very soft. the design looks just like the picture. they are fantastic and so comfy and stylish. the seller also includes contact information in case their products weren\\'t to your expectations. i would definitely buy them again. this was a present for my grandson and he loved it. he wore it right away. the quality was great and it felt really soft. i love this belt because it is very durable and easy to adjust, the pictures are very clear and neat, the colors are very vibrant and they stand out very well against a black pair of pants. the buckle is east to operate, isn\\'t horribly heavy and doesn\\'t poke out too far from under a shirt, it\\'s very flat to your body. i have 3 seat belt belts and love them all. i recommend them to anyone who is looking for a quick on off belt. soft! these were ordered for my son.  he says they fit fine and are very comfortable.  they have been washed a couple of times.  they do fade so wash them alone the first couple of times.  we used a color catcher and it came out almost black!  there is no noticeable fading on the pants.  they seem to be well made and have double knees and crotch.  we will have to wait and see how well they hold up.  my son can be rough on clothes, so time will tell.  at this point, these cost less than in a retail store and seem to be the same quality.  i would recommend them. i love the fit! i am not big, but i have some love handles going on and these pants take care of concealing them. it highlights your derriere area not in a tacky way, its just right. love them. i got the black and gray. worth it so far :) my daughter loves them, she is a competitive skater and uses these for practice. a very nice, crisp suit for the price. as advertised; the jacket fits beautifully and is cut very handsomely. i got these int he mail and before i opened the package there was somthing oily on the bag. i opened them and there was a big stain on the front. :( i contacted the seller and they were very understanding and prompt about responding to my emails. they gave me a full refund and a code for a good percentage off of the new pair that i will be ordering. :) this is something that could have come out and made money years ago. it\\'s just a seat belt used for pants. my son wears nit all the time. the pants are very comfortable but if you are normally a medium buy a small.they are good for anyone who likes comfy pants that look good and can be worn anywhere. i have truly become a fan of baby soy. the material is soft and comfy. and it is baby-friendly. i received my pair of the black/fushia pants yesterday and i love them!! they fit beautifully and i love the length! i ordered a medium and i\\'m 5\\'3\\\\\\\\\". i plan on ordering more!! i typically purchase yoga pants from victorias secret and they are quite expensive. i wont be ordering from them anymore!! oh and they arrived way sooner than expected! thanks!! they were beautiful! i loved them, they were very helpful for my grandaughter and they were very comfortable and clean. they fit perfectly! love these pants!  they are a little thin, but love the way they feel! i bought these slacks to wear to work and am very pleased.  the quality is superb, the fit is perfect, and the look is excellent. love these pants!  they\\'re some of the most comfortable pants i own.  i bought these and the black ripstop pair.  they fit extremely well, and i wear them almost everywhere.  these are really tough pants, i\\'ve put them through a lot and neither pair has ripped yet.  would definitely recommend these pants, i\\'ll probably buy another pair or two myself! love th jumpsuit! love the fit!! and love the compliments! :-) this is what ive waited for since the 80\\'s,  i am a proud long boot wearing legging mama, skinny tall and in my forties.  these are so great thick material, so yeah you know when you where leggings can look like no pants, well this is it awesome!!!!!!!!!!!! have worn alfred dunner for years, love they are washable, saved me thousands over the years.  the texture on the latest pair is rough compared to the ones i bought last year that have a smooth feel.  hopefully that will change after several washes. these are comfy and cozy.  a bit sheer so it may be a good idea to wear your undies.  great! wonderful lounging pants in the cool mornings and so comfortable. yes, yes, yes! i love these pants. they are longer than expected but for great around my hips/butt. but as i said they are really long. soft and light plus they have pockets. would buy again in a heart beat! i\\'m a size 10 (us) and these leggings fit great! the design doesn\\'t stretch and look odd, like it would with some leggings. my grandson loves these military pants that i got him for his birthday.  he wants another pair but in the desert colors. got these pants for my wife for christmas and she loves them. she\\'d wear them every night if i\\'d let her ;) i actually got this pant in a set i bought on ebay. i love this brand! i just put a 3-6 month size of this on my almost 11 pound, 5 week old baby. it was big of course, but i know it\\'ll be great as he grows into it. he is a big wetter and i had a well stuffed pocket cloth diaper on him. it will be great for that! so soft too. i find that the sizing is correct for my babies. everything is always so big on their shoulders.<br /><br />for the people that don\\'t want the name on the bum, the lounge pants don\\'t have it, just the signature. it does state that the logo is there in the description, but maybe they added that after all the comments. don\\'t just go by the photo because they don\\'t show it. it is a very large logo! i don\\'t mind though. these fit as expected. true to size.<br />they are silky feel and fun to wear.<br />dressed up with knee high black boots they are killer!<br /><br />one side note... most leggings with this silky material tend to fall down, or roll over belly muffin tops...but these are fairly good at staying up. fairly good quality material. the material quality is good, although the pant length is a  little long by a half inch, but i always have that issue<br />and do not mind a little tailor work. i work construction in the seattle area.  these are the best that i have tried by far.  they keep me dry, and after wearing them almost everyday for four years i finally wore them out.  i do a lot of walking so i have worn holes in the inseams and the legs are now torn and getting shorter by the day.  they are a heavy rain bib so they do get hot if you are doing anything physical.  i wear a size 13 boot, and it is difficult to put these on with my muck boots on.  that is my only complaint.  i am buying my second pair, so that should say enough. love it! love it! love it! my daughter wears it everyday. being an adjustable belt makes it perfect for her. these are as good as any expensive brand like zaggora or delfin.  i own both those brands and now these and you can\\'t tell the difference except by the logo! you won\\'t be disappointed! excelent product zubaz are awesome, bought these for my girlfriend, she loves them as a sleep/lounge pant. very comfortable and look awesome i love it. gives a great look to any long top. it is lace so i wear a tunic, long shirt, short dress with it great pants for the price! they are comfortable and look flattering. i do wish the bottom hemline were finished, but it doesn\\'t detract from the overall look. loving this yoga pants. will buy another one love it, i use these for home and also find them to be just right with a cami for yoga. best relaxed fit linen pants on this webpage! the fabric is silky feel linen  and the pants are very comfy for a summer time !!thanks a lot! the color in the photo looks to be a reddish brown to me.  in fact, it is not, but still a nice suit and good deal.  lining is poly, but still a good price for super 120 wool.  no vent in jacket.  traditional, wide pant legs.  i\\'ll probably cuff to go with the pleats. wearing and washing well. these pants are very soft and comfortable. perfect it\\'s amazing except it sags a lot in the crotch. i\\'m not looking for cameltoe or anything but i also don\\'t want to be wearing pajama pants in the middle. other than that these fit great and look great. i recently bought 3 pairs of these pants, and i really like them. they\\'re comfortable, and seem decently made. they are rather thin, which makes me think that they are more of a summer pair of lounge pants, but they aren\\'t too thin to see through. i usually wear a large, but upon seeing the way that these were made, i believed that a medium would be a good fit. i\\'m glad to say that i was right. for those who normally wear tall/long, these may fall short of the desired mark. i have long legs (32 1/2&#34; inseam), and tend to have problems with pants of this sort being too short. these are a perfect length (pre-wash). they are made in such a way that if i\\'d gotten the large, they would\\'ve been too loose for my comfort. these pants also look nice enough to wear while running errands, but comfortable enough for trips. i rate these a 4 instead of 5 because i would have liked the pants better if they weren\\'t so low rise when folded over. other than that they are nice pants, and i\\'d recommend them to anyone. love this tank...fit is true to size... i plan on ordering at least one more... they are so soft and warm, they have great colors too! whenever i wear them i get so many compliments. did i mention that they\\'re so soft? they do fade away if you wash them in the washing machine though, so hand washing may be best. great fit and liteweight material perfect for my walks with the dogs thru the woods and the weeds my dogs are hunters so i normally never stay on the nicely mowed path im usually dodging trees and fellen wood not to mention the muck and when its hot out its really uncomfortable but i think these pants will protect my legs and i wont be sweating the price was great also these are amazing for all stages of pregnancy and post-partum wear. i have purchased two pairs now. they wash well and fit comfortably, especially during recovery. these are the absolute best pj\\'s. i found them when i was pregnant with my daughter - bought her a bunch of them and had them on her as much as possible for the first 6 months of her life. they wash wonderfully and they\\'re super soft....you do have to be careful since they\\'re so soft - they can make the baby a little slippery.<br /><br />just started to stockpile for my little boy en route! bought for a white party- comfy and look good this item was as described and packaged well.  the fit was good and the item was received in a timely manner.  thank you i\\'m really satisfied with the pants. it was delivered promptly. thanks a lot! just as described.<br />fit was just right, the print is adorable!<br />super warm and soft, would reccomend to others as well. very good i love the pants but be prepared to exchanged as is the case with online shopping. first pair were tighter than expected so i went up two sizes which helped alot i wash and wear these every other day. i\\'m 6\\'1&#34; and i got the medium and they\\'re long enough for me. fit great. they run high and the waist. about to my belly button. great for concealing that problem area until you\\'ve worked out enough to lose it. very warm. insulate your legs very well. awesome pants... if you\\'re larger than a size 10, you probably won\\'t fit in the xl. very cute!  shipping took a little longer then expected. these shorts run slightly small i\\'m 5\\'\\'2 130lbs and i usually wear a small but ordered a medium and the fit perfect.  i like it snug but not to tight. i don\\'t think i will get much wear out of these shorts due to the satiny fabric but they weren\\'t expensive and i\\'m only speculating. bought two of these for myself and my mother. they fit great and are soooo comfortable!! great for the gym or lounging. i found a pair of the embellished ones at a store in town, they have the koi fish on them, then i searched online (after trying more expensive pairs) and found these.<br /><br />i normally wear a small, and these are just a tiny bit snug around the waist, and the fold-over waist is pretty stout (a good thing), so i will not be putting these in the dryer.  highly recommend.  good length too i purchased a pair of ultimate cargo pants to wear for work. i very quickly transitioned to wearing them as my go-to pants. they are lightweight, comfortable, true to fit, and functional. the pockets are plentiful, and the right size for all of your gear. they don\\'t bunch up. and the magnetic closures are reliable. i have owned my current pair for nearly 3 years, and they have held up wonderfully. they saw heavy use through a trip to paris, normandy, and amsterdam. they have survived climbing under desks (i work in it... it\\'s one of the hazards), weather - they\\'re convertible, which means they\\'ll get me through three seasons of wear. oh, and they look good. adorable pajama bottoms! they arrived in more than enough time for christmas and my 13-year-old niece adores them. she also says they are extremely comfortable. these fit well and work great for a newborn. really like the soft cotton material and how well the pants are made amazing pants thanks these pants were just what i wanted.  warm and cozy and a good fit.  a good choice for pajama bottoms. these jeans are nice.  they fit as expected however the waistline is somewhat stretching out after only a couple of wears my new fav pants to wear shipped in 14 days exactly. looks exactly like pic and size is correct. i love these pants. very comfortable. leg length is perfect. i\\'m 5\\'10. fits just as it says online and as expected. excellent price. it\\'s a good quality product. perfect to protect your baby.<br />it has satisfied my expectations. . . . my hot slimming capri pants leggings fits perfectly.  i exercise in them and also wear them to work.  the stomach,  hips, and leg  support cannot be beat! i i have tried other so-called slimming pants even at a much higher price, but they cannot beat these and at a lower price!  please don\\'t go up on the price.  i will purchase another pair and very soon!  i give these a 5 star rating for a great product and fast shipping! haven\\'t started training her yet, but they fit well! grate product, works great, very satisfied, does the job, no complaint , will buy again, very easy to buy product great looking. i am very patriotic. love they way they feel pretty durable. would recommend the site to someone else. good fit, wears well, soft and comfortable. my soccer playing granddaughter wears them to practice over her uniform to keep her warm. she love them. great quality pants but a bit short if you have long legs. i own several pairs, and they all fit great. bought 1st pr on line then found them in wal-mart for half the price. $19.99 vs $36-40.00 you decide which is better. like these a lot.  great for spring/summer weather and they look great with a t shirt.  will be getting more... took forever to get them but i\\'m pleased with the quality and fitting of the shorts. absolutely love this sweatsuit!!!!!! the pants are very pretty and good quality.  i have ordered this brand before and these fit a little smaller than others. fits well pants are a little long but my son isn\\'t quiet 2 yet so i don\\'t see anything wrong with that overall good buy i am in total awe, i am happy to see my items showed up and there is still 30 days remaining on estimated arrival. item is even better than the picture. i am very thrilled with this company and 110% recommend to all women looking for some thing cool to wear. thanks these were purchased for a 3 month old. they were a bit tight in the waist. they don\\'t have a super stretchy waist elastic like other baby pants you buy and i wish they did. the elastic is really thin and that makes waistbands not as comfortable.<br /><br />the fabric was perfect for me. very thin! i didn\\'t need a bulky, super warm pant but if you do don\\'t buy these. they\\'re lightweight! which as i said was just what i was looking for for springtime.<br /><br />the colors are pretty true to the photos. i have three pairs of these, the light green, the purple, and the brown. the brown in the photo is darker than they are in real life. the green and purple look like the exact color. very comfortable, lightweight linen trousers. bought a pair in store at 20 weeks (10 weeks ago). i have super sensitive skin so the band in front can get a little itchy, but for regular ladies you probably won\\'t even notice it. i just tuck a tank top into the band or pull up my granny panties. these are essential for warm weather because the pants/jeans with the elastic band are making me sweat like crazy and it\\'s only the end of april! (in nyc). skirts/dresses make sense at this point in my pregnancy (30 weeks) but i prefer trousers so these are great: flowy, breathable, lightweight, and you can dress them up or down. i\\'m going to buy another pair, not crazy about the lighter color, wish there was a grey or navy or darker brown (or even fun colors) so i\\'ll just buy another pair in black. these seem like they\\'d work great for post-pregnancy... for a few months at least.     i am 160 lbs and 5\\'6\\\\\\\\\" and the sm worked well for me. med fell off and was too long.     only critiques:     1. i have a big butt and the pockets make it look even bigger, but i don\\'t care b/c i\\'m pregnant and just need to be comfy! plus if i wear a top that covers the pockets it negates the problem.    2. they are made for women who are either really tall or wear heels. i am 5\\'6\\\\\\\\\" and hate heels, plus who wears heels in pregnancy?! so you might need to hem them or just let them billow.     3. when belly starts to get really big you have to hike the trousers up every so often while walking around, but it\\'s nothing too crazy. i finally bought something she really liked! she said they\\'re so comfortable and she loves them. good job me  :) very good buy\\'m happy with my legis comfy comfy and i like the pockets. great loungers. love it!! fabric is nice and light easy to wash and wear, so very comfortable, the elastic has just the right give!! i wish they fit a little looser, but they are still incredibly comfortable, with nice pockets. love these pants...they look great and give great comfort so comfortable, i bought another pair. since there were no previous reviews, i took a chance on these pants for my daughter. i am not disappointed! very cute, appropriately sized, and great quality. the cut is a little strange in the back, but it kind of adds a bit of charm. i wish they would sell matching long sleeve tops with this as the chance i took on the iplay organic shirts was not as fruitful as this one. good easy to use, adhered to denim and stayed put until i took the tape off.  i highly recommend this product. love the fit i really love these yoga pants . the fit is perfect ans the material is so comfortable . they wash very well also . i wore them to yoga and got lots of compliments. very comfortable to work out in and flattering great pants if only the med were a half inch bigger theyd be perfect right size good fit, would order again i love these!!! these are the softest, most comfortable capris i\\'ve ever had! the pants are awesome too!!! i\\'ve purchased 3 more in other colors! bought these for my husband. he loves them and will probably order more. great fit,  material is thin and breathable.  comfortable and durable. will probably order more. these pants are great! they are soft to the touch and stretchy enough that they do not leave any marks. they wash and dry very well.  if your child has an accident, it stays in the pants until you can get him or her to the potty.  we call them magic pants!  i am purchasing another set, and i recommend these pants to anyone trying to potty train! i had to sew a panel into the crotch of these pants to make them more flexible, but once i did they fit like a dream. nice pants though quite long for my 5\\'4&#34; frame.  i just fold the waist and wear heels. thin material but not too thin, more of a nice summer weight. i\\'m satisfied. feel like wearing a thick blanket in a good way. extremely warm and comfy. cheap, yet sturdy, material is not very soft. fit great! love how soft these are, even though they run a little short. also like how they match the touched by nature bodysuits. we are wearing the 9-12 month passed 12 months since it\\'s summer and having shorter pants isn\\'t an issues. these are great for spring through fall. these pants are the perfect pajama pants!! my teenager is super picky about  the comfort level of his pj\\'s and he adores these pants! they fit perfect. we ordered the medium. he is tall and skinny and they fit perfect! every time i put on these pants i feel like kicking some serious butt.  my roundhouses have also improved dramatically while wearing them. to be honest, the quality isnt super high, but let me tell you, the fit for a short girl around 5\\'2&#34; is perfect. what i love is how the bottoms aren\\'t oversized and the length isn\\'t super long. you can also just wear it out as regular pants if you wanted to. i would absolutely buy another pair once these wear out. absolutely love these pants. so comfy. fit great. wow, i love these capri pajama bottoms!  they are so very soft and comfortable, i wear them all the time! they\\'re super comfy and fit great good length, but waist stretched out after first use. perfect they fit as expect and are so comfy as if you not wearing pants i have always worn liz claiborne.  they make wonderful clothes and i have worn this label for years.<br />thank you. i\\'m 5\\'4&#34;, 120 lbs., and the small size fit me perfect!  i will probably buy at least one more of these for my morning work-outs! i absolutely love this outfit..it fit great..and so sexy..the material is nice and not cheaply made..i got an xl..im 5,5 and weight 160lbs..i dont regret buying this and also ordered the green and blue jumpsuit with blue built-in belt..cant wait until it comes great costume for my toddler. he loves it and bonus everybody sing the song and he dances. easy to put on and off. love it i am very glad i purchased these leggings. the material is very smooth unlike the scratchy kind at other stores. it fits great. my butt looks perkier and my legs look longer. i\\'m going to purchase a few more of these in different colors because these leggings are outstanding. these fit well. they are highwaisted. i ordered the regular length and i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; and they\\'re a little long but very very comfy. the fabric doesn\\'t fade or shrink in the wash. after reading other reviews i ordered one size up and it fits great, although the style is still fitted versus relaxed. i bought it in red and the color is very nice, it washes well too. the waist fit ok, but i have short legs so the pants are long. they are a little large, but comfy. a little tight in the waist. but overall great fit! sent them to my sister.  she loves them! likes the way the pants fit. lots of compliments.. perfect will buy again product is cute with all the dogs on it. shipping was fast. for the patriot in all of us, these pants are super comfy and give you all kinds of room and flexibility.  highly enjoy them. skirt to short. these were perfect!  i am ordering more.  wish they had more colors.  i ordered 2 sizes order according to other reviews.  glad i did perfect fit and i love them. if you are looking for a true legging with style and very comfy this is for you. love the thickness of these for the colder months. so comfortable and attractive fit! length is perfect for me, i\\'m 5\\'7&#34;. love them i ordered this, rec\\'d it (12 months) and begin to wonder if it was too small for my grandsons first birthday. i contacted them. they advised to order the 18 months and then return the 12 for refund instead of exchange due to the short time frame before his birthday. i rec\\'d the 18 months and found the 12 months fit so i had to return the 18. they were very curteous and answered all communication i had with them. refund rec\\'d in a timely matter, i would buy here again. we ordered these pants in a small long.  my husband normally wears 31 inch waist and 34 inch inseam pants.  the length was great - just a little long, but the ties at the ankle prevent them from hitting the ground, and depending on what you\\'re doing, can prevent snow from getting inside.  the material is great, the legs are roomy which allows for easy layering with long underwear, and it has many large pockets.<br /><br />the downside, which is weird, is that these pants are tight around the hips.  it\\'s hard to get things in and out of the hip pockets, it\\'s so tight.  i tried them on, and i wear a 29 inch waist pant, and i had the same problem.<br /><br />it might be necessary to order these a size larger than the size chart indicates. fitted as expected perfect staff, even better than mustang color of same model.  pay attention on size difference, mustang color pants are larger! love them!  will be ordering more. while i do like the fit of these pants, they\\'re too shear, in my opinion to wear to a co ed gym or yoga. they also collect fuzz, hair, whatever - overall - i got what i paid for. i bought these for my husband this christmas and he loves them.  they are nice and long, very comfortable and simple.  perfect lounge or pajama pants! they are really confortable and durable, very good quality for the price. my daughter is 9mo, 23lbs and 28in, and has been wearing the 6-9 months size since she was 5mo, when they were a little big. they are perfect to stay at the house and as pajamas. came with holes with them but overall great works well i can now wear my new jeans i just recently got this sweatpant and i have to say that i love how it looks,the fabric is good quality and price. i absolutely recommend this pants. better than most in length if you are tall. my 5\\'10&#34; daughter wears them with boots, but she may be able to wear with tom\\'s in the spring. arrived quickly. good quality. they do run somewhat small though, so i advise ordering up a size. a bit too long, but easy to hem. i read reviews before purchasing. i normally wear a 34 x 32 in jeans. took everyone\\'s advice and bought one size up on waist and one size shorter in length. 36 x 30 is a perfect fit! pants are very comfortable ! i absolutely love these pants! they are the dopest things ever! very satisfied with them would recommended them to anyone whose not afraid to stand out! i would give them 5 stars, but they\\'re not as soft as some of the joggers i have gotten. very comfy. like wearing your jammies in the street!! the pants were small!!<br />but these scrubs are gorgeous!!! i love these pants!!!! the most comfortable fit. i tried them on at home under a skirt and forgot i was wearing them. i am so happy i bought these pants.  they fit perfectly.  the material is great.  i will wear these a lot,.  i might even buy more. love these pants! great fit and the material is lovely! if there were more in my size and other colors i would purchase them! my son is 10 months old, 31 inches tall and 21 pounds.  initially i ordered the 12-18 month size, but ended up returning all but one for the 18-24 size.  it was a tight fit and even though 12-18 mos fit him, i wanted something he could grow in to  they are so, so soft and my son seems to like them a lot (at least there are no protests unlike his footie pjs).  however, after opening all the coveralls i noticed that the leg lengths were different for all three.  my husband saw them laid out and said, &#34;it looks like a goldie locks \\'three bears\\' situation.&#34;  we had a short, medium and tall... see picture.  the arm and crotch lengths are all the same... it\\'s just the legs that are all different.  he\\'s tall enough to do okay with the shorter two, but i\\'ll probably store the long one until fall when he won\\'t trip on the excess fabric. but i am so impressed with the quality, softness and snap strength that i won\\'t be ordering any other brand of pjs.  ** natural was the shortest coverall, light blue was the medium, and twilight was the long** after surfing the internet for different harem pants, i found this one to be the best one yet! despite being a bit short (and a little stubby), i found these pants to be awesome! they\\'re very stretchy and soft making them easy to wear at home or outside. since i\\'m short, i found myself having to pull them higher than my usual pants, but it didn\\'t feel uncomfortable at all. they don\\'t look or feel very baggy, which is a good thing especially if you\\'re worried about looking like you have a huge diaper around yourself. these are fabulous.  they fit perfectly, they wash nicely.  my only complaint is that the elastic rolls, but that\\'s not enough to stop me from buying more.  i haven\\'t been able to find pants like these in a very long time. i liked these so much that i ordered another pair. they\\'re soft, comfortable, and warm. what more could anyone want? good my man really likes hanging out at the house with these on. ordered two of these for costumes in a play.  they fit both actors perfectly and lasted for a 5-week run. the only issue i had with it was that it was a little long and wide at the bottom, however, around my waist and thighs were a perfect fit. i am a 5ft, petite figure, so it might explain for the long pant leg. first off i would like to say, awesome to do business with. super fast shipping=)!!<br /><br />secondly, i adore these pants. i originally bought these for work out pants. i ended up using them for scrubs at work. they are so comfortable and soft when working on overnights! when i first got them however the draw string at the waist made them way to tight, creating the muffin top effect. which in a medium size is a little disappointing. they fit everywhere else perfectly. i just was super disappointed with the muffin top- so i cut the draw string out. the top of the pants have their own elastic band so the draw string is completely useless as the pants hold them selves up on their own.<br /><br />after i cut the draw string i have absolutely no complaints about these pants!!! i am defiantly happy with my purchase and i would defiantly buy again!!! the pants run shorter than expected, but like the pattern and the feel. received my package early. pants are not very shiny, if that is the look that you are going for, and they are skin tight but very stretchy and very comfortable. reasonably priced and although the material is thin, the seams are extremely neat. these are my absolute favorite yoga pants! they\\'re long and comfy! love, love, love! will definitely be back for more! they fit great and are super comfy and easy to move around in! i\\'ll be buying from here again! very cute! really like these, very soft nice gift for my girls. they have a thing for the mustache. it\\'s a joke in our family. i love mine.  super comfy.  i\\'ve had mine for about a year. and they\\'re still in great shape. wide legs and very comfortable. my wife needed wide leg pants while recovering from foot surgery wearing a cast and then boot. they are comfortable and she loves the pockets. while a little long, the full side zipper and the light weight make these an otherwise perfect tennis trouser. the were what i was expecting, they would be better if the inside pockets were on both sides. i am tall, thin, and a medium will fit a 35-36&#34; inseam! the fold-over waist is perfectly stretchy yet firm fitting. the dryer shrunk them slightly in length but they still fit great!! i love it a lot!!! its simple but eye catching. dress it up dress it down. very comfortable. don\\'t like it as pants, but love em as a jumper/ romper. i am rating the length is perfect but it runs a bit snug. i ordered 2x but for a loosed fit order a size up such a great outfit good quality material and everyone adored it! at the time i was 5\\'4.75&#34; and 126lbs and ordered a medium. like everything about this item except too small, will order a larger next time these run a little on the larger size.  but i like the quality and the shape. these are thin but compared to victorias secret which has 60-80$ yoga pants like this this product is awesome! low price and looks great! would recommend it to other buyers use only these every winter rainy season in seattle. go on easily over my large rain boots/shoes easily accessible right rear wallet pocket with 1 1/2 inch tab. lower ankle zippers are plastic tipped almost and inch long easy to operate. illuminite and reflective strip run from front hip leg all the way around to back of leg. i left a pair on a transit bus/checked with lost and found and never got them back. these are great - super soft and comfortable with a nice stretchy belly. if i\\'m being really picky, for yoga purposes, they are more cotton-y in feel than the stretch & support of traditional yoga pants, but they do the trick. i was very pleased with my order.  my order meet my expectations.  i like the way they look and fit on me. these are the best baby sleepers. so soft and comfortable. i like the plain ones so they can wear them out without looking like they are wearing pyjamas. these awe worth the investment! they pill a little over time but good outweighs that. love love love these pants. they are so comfy and the print is seriously so amazing (i got st-01). they are a little long (i\\'m 5\\'3) but that\\'s to be expected. now i want all the colors!!!<br /><br />also i wasn\\'t sure about how to wash them (i know others were too), so just to be careful i hand washed them in cold water with woolite and they were totally fine. very satisfied. the material texture pockets are all well made. extremely soft!!! comfortable running and walking. a bit too long but it\\'s not a problem. comfy and cute.  a little large, but washed well. happy with them. comfy and cute. fits larger than my previous lazy one pj\\'s. i am 5\\'2 size 3 and they fit peeeerfect! i absolutely love them. they look exactly like they do in the picture needed these for a production of frankenstein. perfect fit and better than expected. i\\'m in love with these pants the quality was fine. i usually wear a size large, but this set was a little too snug for me to be comfortable. brilliant suit, i recommend buying it for every day or just for cosplay use.<br />all the pockets are real, with correctly placed inside pockets, surprisingly high quality wool with no visible defects on the one i got.<br />even though it is a &#34;costume&#34; suit i recommend taking it to a good tailor just for that extra fitted look, this happened to baffle the tailor i brought it to, they thought it was a vintage suit and said that most guys would kill for the dual elastic in the pants.<br />higher quality than my &#34;regular&#34; suit bought at an actual suit store, but was still less expensive.<br />overall the suit is very comfortable, made of a thin wool so it breathes well without feeling heavy.<br /><br />docking one star because of the shoulder pads, they cheapen it, they\\'re small but they\\'re noticable. i would have preferred no shoulder reinforcement since the rest of the material is thin. in addition the pinstripes are white, not blue like i would have preferred, also there is a ton of lint, loose threads, fluff etc. that needed to be picked off.<br /><br />overall i have no idea why magnoli is trying to sell their version of the same suit for 4x the price. and make sure you check your size on their sizing chart, british/canadian/american sizes are all different, normally i would fit a regular, but had to go down to a small. nice comfee fit.  no tight areas to worry about.  soft fabric and feels great when wearing, and working out. a bit more &#34;wind proof&#34; than i would like which makes them, for me at least, a little warm. am wishing i had ordered 2 cause i will wear the heck out of them in fall/winter. good pants. i was blown away when i opened my package! these leggings look soo good and i can\\'t wait to showcase them. :) pants arrived quickly and fit great.  the legs are slightly long, which is perfect for me since i\\'m tall.  the material is super soft and seems to be of good construction, at least so far. i am a small person 5\\'3  120 pounds and usually wear size 5 in juniors and they fit perfectly as shown. the material is as nice as anything at target. which is fine with me! super cute yoga pants! not bad composition of material, either. definitely recommend as it helps wick away your sweat. good quality this is my first snow pants and these did the job ok, these are quite long for me (5\\'10) and these don\\'t have buttons or eyelets for suspenders<br /><br />and these are olive green not black!!!!! (i had no time to replace or return them but it was very disappointing when i saw the color for these) i usually wear a size l-xl and ordered the l. these fit great! the material is a little flimsier than i had expected. i was hoping to wear them to work. i think they will be more for parties and after work. i am 5\\'8, though, and these are a little long on me. overall, happy with the purchase and would buy again! fits and looks good. certainly a great deal for the price they are great for visual aid of body in movement despite not precisely correct in lower extremity anatomy.  definite chemical smell.  takes a few washings. i get so many compliments on these! very nice.  looks great on model. cute as a button comfy, ergonomic and all the pockets i need.  perfect for airsoft, which is what i will be using this for. wife loves them if you know how to hem pants, this will do fine.  my girls were 7 and not very tall so i had to get them shortened. my mother lives in these pants during the spring into summer months.  since she is aging and losing height i purchased the petite and they are perfect. i also go up a size to allow for shrinkage since they are 100% cotton. thank you outstanding quality!! gave these to my sister for christmas. she loves them. says they are very comfortable! hope they hold up after several washings. soo cool, i love them, fit great and got a lot of compliments on them! the pants fits perfect, not too tight or not baggy. the pants itself is very trendy and goes with any top you match it with.<br />very good purchase. i like it and it\\'s fitting good... i would like to buy one more with a new color great great quality. quality as expected, fit as expected this is super cute.  nice quality. i just can\\'t find any other yoga pants like these.  esp for the price.  they are actually cotton with just the right amount of spandex to make them feel perfect.  i\\'m sick of those other yoga pants that don\\'t breath and have that thick sleek feel.  if i had my way i would wear these every day, they are that comfortable.  i get pretty cold and so i just layer my favorite base layer underneath them and i\\'m warm and cozy like i\\'m wearing sweatpants.  on sizing, i am very slim, usually take an xs at 106 lbs and 5\\'8&#34; but the small in these fit beautifully, like a glove.  so i would say maybe to size up since i never wear a small and have it fit like these do.  as for length, they are perfect, and i do have long legs.  yet one pair is noticeably like 1.5 inches longer than the other two, not sure why but it doesn\\'t bother me.  i am finally back for my first pair in a color, purple.  as for yoga, yes, you can do yoga in these!  i do yoga every day and these are my go to pants.  no pilling at all, none.  i washed these a hundred times each and they have held up.  i just hope my family isn\\'t sick of seeing them on me, because i\\'m not sick of wearing them, ha.  hope this helps. very comfortable. no shrinkage and little fading after multiple washings. good product thin, could have been a little heaver materiel. not heavy sweatpant material just light lounge pants.  perfect for the potterhead in your life.  fits somewhat smaller, so if you like your lounge pants baggy get a size up. was a gift for my younger sister and she love it to much. this is my second pair of these yoga pants from this seller.  i love them!  the first pair, which are navy, fit me best.  i bought these (white) in the same size and they are too loose on me.  but i still love them.  i am six feet tall, with long legs.  usually i have to pay $60 and up to get quality pants that are long enough.  these are soft, not too thin or thick.  they have a slim fit, of course, being yoga pants.  they flare out below the knee, giving them sort of a boot cut, which is very flattering.  the waist is long enough for me, which is also rare.  i can wear these pants with any shoes and they work.  can\\'t say enough about how nice and comfortable they are.  i will likely buy a couple more pairs next fall.  maybe they will expand the colors to include red, sage green, and a camel color.  i would buy them! the color is nice but the material is very unforgivingly thin and delicate. nice & soft material! very comfortable to wear!! haven\\'t washed so i hope the softness doesn\\'t pile  love them so far use it for travel and at night.  soft does the job super cute outfit. a bit on the big size but not much. the only thing is there was some random strings at some of the hems throughout the jacket. other than that it\\'s super cute. i would buy again i am in love with those shorts.  perfect for wearing under a dress or other clothing, is very comfortable and i like how they look. :) the color is beautiful. it has very good finishing and fabric is super soft and comfortable. i really enjoyed it. love them just too long these pants are awesome.they fit bigger than i thought but i like. the stretchy top is itchy but i\\'ll just wear a tank or sports bra under. love this pant!  super comfortable, light weight...i am 120lbs 5\\'4&#34; and i took the medium... the small may have fit better on the waist but not an issue i purchased the galaxy leggings in blue and in hot pink as well. i was skeptical of the size because i have a 24 inch waist and 40 inch hips but they fit well with a little extra wiggle room in the crotch.  they are warm enough for a chilly day and very silky. i felt comfortable wearing them as pants since they weren\\'t giving camel toe action and they were not see through.  i would say they are somewhere between a medium and a large size wise but are very stretchy in both directions. now the marine in the family can look and feel like a marine that he is. they are very comfy i would highly reccomend these stylish tights. they are as described and compliments my figure well. great material. i\\'d say the only con is the band is snug around your waist so you can see the line where the band is through your shirt.  it\\'s not a big deal for me because i plan on wearing them with a crop top anyway. the tights are very comfortable though. i ordered more. great purchase. really love this, it\\'s super comfy.  material is a little thin and see through, but there\\'s so much gathering it\\'s not an issue.  i\\'m 5\\'0, 145 lbs, 36dd, for the  shorter lady perspective...  i would never wear it as pants though... awesome product. feels very comfortable and the quality is great. will purchase from again. sexy love this!! so cute and comfy to lounge in or run errands. i\\'m petite (5 feet) so i have to roll the waist a little but it\\'s not a big deal. would love this in more colors/patterns. i searched hard for the perfect tailcoat, one of good quality and that is cut well, elegant, yet sharp, just the thing that will hug my physique. in frustration at not finding the right one (with the right lapels, the needed fit, etc.) i finally stumbled unto amazon and figured if i order on amazon at least i know i won\\'t be cheated. my apprehension was hardly warranted. the thing arrived and it was a beaut! and right on time too--a mere two days after the order. 5 stars! why won\\'t the retailers cut jackets for the true gents, the true aesthetes anymore?<br /><br />note that the brick and mortar stores will measure you for jackets/suits like it is drapery, like it is the suit your granddad used to wear; this might be okay for a suit but for a tailcoat, you need it to hug you like your dear one. so i suggest you do as i do: i dropped my size from the brick and mortar store\\'s suggestion of 48 regular to 46 regular when ordering this tailcoat. it was perfect and comfortable too! thank you. i bought these for my girlfriend because she wanted something for yoga, the fabric is really soft and silky like cotton but with a slight sheen, a really classy look. she loves them and says they are ultra comfortable. i would guess that they have a great fit range as the waist band is really stretchy. love it first pair i had lasted about 20 years and i\\'m sure these will also.  fabric is doubled in the knees and the seat.  cargo pockets are a bit hard to get into but i can live with that.  at least what goes in them, won\\'t work it\\'s way out. size of the pants for waist run on the lower number for med size. these are really comfortable pants. they fit really well. bought a large, im 6\\'2&#34; 190lb. fits perfectly. people don\\'t want a round house kick to the face while i\\'m in these bad boys. bought these to show some spirit for the 4th of july. they arrived much sooner than expected (w/in a week and a half). these are super thin and the white portion when stretched is totally see through so be sure to wear something to cover your back and front. i ordered large based on reviews (i usually wear a 4/6) but they are really big.  i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; and expected them to be long.  that said, they are really well made, great sturdy material.  i am not a fan of the forward facing pocket flats as i find they get in the way when i\\'m trying to put something into or get something out of my pocket.  i work in theater and easy access to the pockets is important to me.  i find i have to leave the pockets unbuttoned and am not fond of that look.  however, i am keeping these as they are comfortable and i think they will last a long time.  i don\\'t mind them a bit slouchy.  they arrived super quickly and the company was great about communicating with me about shipping.  i have ordered another style by molecule in a smaller size and am looking forward to receiving them soon.  update september 4-- received a second pair as a replacement for a different style that did not wear well (ripped at snap on second wearing).  i ordered a medium instead of a large and they fit perfectly- no gap at waist and roomy in the legs which i like).  i am 5\\'3&#34; and usually wear a 4 or 6.  the mediums are still pretty long, but at 5\\'3&#34;, i\\'m used to that. these pants, as others have mentioned, are long! i am 5\\'8 and can wear 2-3inch heels with no problem. pattern looks better in person. i get compliments whenever i wear them. i like these pants, but wish they had side pockets. other than that, they fit well and look good. what more can i say? a very good weight yoga pant. run a little short but that is ok. nicely made this hat has a very nice feel to it.  the fabric is soft, silky, and light which makes it great for summer time.  i really like the material a lot.<br /><br />problem i have is that i ordered the one for 0-12 months and the hat looks very large.  definitely not for a newborn.  i think you\\'re suppose to untie the knot and make it smaller for newborns but if you do this then you have a very large knot area.  would have been nice if they made the hat for 0-6 months at least closing the gap and making the hat more custom for that age group. my daughter can pull these up and down easily, but they stay up and in place great on their own.  they have a thin cotton pad and then a very thin plastic layer inside so they are good for minor accidents but not to hold lots of urine. these are so cute that i have worn them for yoga and other activities.  lots of colors available for the fold-over band. nice costume, fits nicely, comfortable to wear. would definitely buy from seller again. i can\\'t stop buying these! the stretcher works as advertised, even without wetting.  i am happy and more comfortable. it\\'s almost christmas so the mail delivery service is sluggish. telling by info provided throughout my order process, my product is late because usps is prolly extremely busy. with that said, i love my blk \\\\med suit! happy w cordiu, happy w sweatsuit, happy customer. :) i\\'m telling everyone of my girl friends to check this out. -m nice and soft. material is really light. love the length. i would not suggest drying them. these are my first pair of jeggings ever. bought them for work and i am in love with them! i normally wear a size 8 jeans, ordered a large and fit perfect! not quite the material i was hoping for, but they\\'re still very nice. they are thin and fit perfectly under my clothes.  especially great for those of us who wear close-fitted jeans.  just the right amount of layering that i was warm enough outside in the snow, yet cool enough inside next to the fire.  please note, that these do not call themselves thermals.  they are not even close. they\\'re more like comfy soft tights.  it was -6 degrees where i was and these long johns were good for going outside for brief periods of time like taking out the trash and walking the dogs.  good for those of us who pop in and out of the house a lot.  my [...] was still frozen when i got back from walking the dogs, but it could have been worse... and they\\'re thin enough that i didn\\'t need to take them off inside from overheating. worst part about winter, in my opinion, is all the layering up.  time consuming as all get out.  these babies made it a tad easier. so comfortable! very lightweight. shipped quickly. fabric is a little bit fragile - snags easily.  would i get them again?  yes. great fit. perfect for our spice girl skit at school... i love these! they fit really well and they\\'re really comfy too. i wasnt sure about the feel of this material \\'till i put them on. i like \\'em. now i gotta hem \\'em. what i expected and enjoy, however even in black their a bit see through. guess that\\'s why they make tunics. p r o d u c t  i s  a  v e r y  g o o d  quality and fit perfectly! these &#34;jeans&#34; are great ! look good and accentuate your curves and feel, &#34;oh so good&#34; you will be glad you ordered these very inexpensive fashion additions. fits as i expected comfy, but shrunk in the dryer. order a size up. these trousers are very comfortable and great for summer hot weather wear. the material is shinier than i expected - not super shiny, but they do have a sheen on them. i thought they would be a completely flat finish from the photo. that\\'s why i give them 4 stars instead of five. i don\\'t know how sturdy the sewing on the seams etc are as i haven\\'t had them long and i\\'ve only only washed them once, and then line dried them, not in the dryer.  good news is, they didn\\'t shrink, but they\\'re still shiny (i was hoping going through the wash might make a difference).<br /><br />if you like these type of harem pants, these are worth getting - i have seen much worse quality and cut!  they come in a variety of colors so it\\'s worth keeping in mind that  the shiny aspect will probably be more noticeable the lighter the color. love these leggings. they look great and are comfortable. everyone says i look great in them. i\\'ve had them a few years now and they have lasted a long time. great leggings, warm, cute and comfy. my 1 year old loves them and got lot of compliments on them :) great product, fits great... very soft but runs a bit small came much faster than i expected, the fabric doesnt stretch the same way that most leggings do, but they are amazingly soft, warm and comfortable!!! a+++ my 3yo is very tall and has a small waist. we have trouble finding underwear that he can wear comfortably because usually if they fit in the waist, they are too tight around his thighs.these are still a little loose around the waist, but they stay up and keep him covered where he needs it. the quality is very good as well. they typically won\\'t leak unless he has a big accident. same to picture! spectacular super cute and light weight. immediately ordered another pair. i always love my hard tail pants :) i absolutely love these sweatpants!  i would wear them every day and every where if that was reasonable. the pockets are deep and the fabric is soft. they fit me perfectly. nice good i\\'m 5\\'8 140 lbs purchased medium. fit great! love the material... these are very nice thick  wish the skirt was just a bit longer.  the band at top twist some. but these are the nicest skirted leggings i have seen  i would give them 5 stats if not for the above  i would not put these in dryer, i was in hurry to wear once put in dryer  shrunk.  they do not use dryers in korea long enough for a tall woman and very soft feel. live in them on the weekends. i would buy again. the smallest size (extra small) was a \\\\\\\\\"34\\\\\\\\\".  it was a bit big on my daughter who is a 0-3 juniors.  also very long on her, she is only about 5 ft tall.  it is probably between a 3-5 juniors in size.  we were happy with them. i\\'ve looked high & low for sweatpants with pockets, no drawstring, and no ankle cuff.  i ordered one pair to try, and am now ordering 3 more.  material is excellent quality, mid to heavyweight, nice & warm. i am 5\\'4\\\\\\\\\", 125 lbs, and the medium fit is roomy. the ankle opening is wide and fits over boots.  had to wait for backorder, but it came eventually.  worth the wait. these fit so well, and they make an awesome fashion statement. they look exactly like they do in the picture. i love them. i bought the l/xl pants, as i usually wear a 12. they fit perfectly. i didn\\'t think the extra side panel was quite so large, but it really is as pictured. i like the pants, however, and plan on wearing them whenever i want to look a little funky, or even to an evening concert and want to make a dramatic statement. i recommend these pants! when i was potty training my oldest 34 years ago, i used these sort of training pants and they were (and still are) wonderful! they are almost impossible to find in a retail store nowadays, people much prefer to pay for disposables again and again, versus actually working with your child on potty training with cloth training pants that are easily washed, dried and ready to use again! thanks amazon for having these in stock, and thanks to gerber for not caving in to current trends and doing away with this sort of product all together!<br /><br />i will say these do run on the big side of things size wise, so don\\'t feel you have to get the next size up for ease of putting them on or taking them off. order the size of pants that your child wears currently and they will be big enough to last to the next size up as well, i am sure. super sexy i had to give them to a friend because of how big they are. and theyre very long. but i loved them i just need to reorder a size or two smaller i have these pants in sand and also in black and i absolutely love them!  they are so comfortable, easy to care for and are a nice compromise between jeans and dress pants. very cool, wish they had a unisex or male version. most of the reviews mentioned how these ran small... so i went with a size larger than i normally would and i think i should have just stuck with my normal size. so for me, these are true to size. also, some were complaining that the material was too thin or very frail in the previous reviews and i wanted to add that mine were not. these are what i would call only slightly burned out. so you can\\'t see through the material if you are worried that they may fall apart. overall, i like mine very well. these pants are very comfortable. the down side is the drawstrings are too long and they\\'re only for show. but the pants look very nice. i think these will be nice little pants for my granddaughter in the future, just very large for right now. these are not capri pants, so don\\'t\\' use the picture associated with them to judge. i\\'m a tall person (5\\'10&#34;) and they come almost to my ankles. you will have to adjust your senses because the pants smell like rubber which is not likely to go away for quite a while. otherwise, i think they do the job well! a little large, but it`s is a great product !! the stretch is just enough, the bones fall in the perfect spot, very comfortable, and soft. i\\'m very glad with this purchase, the cost and wait wasn\\'t even too bad. it\\'s greg  i\\'ve word went i go to work i sweat a lot when i got them out of pkg i had to revhrvk thst i didn\\'t order kids size however the fit so comfortably. im 5\\'2 130 lbs and am not cramped theyre perfect...well a little long cuz im short i originally got these for yoga, but the crotch area gets a little tight in certain poses, so i mostly use them for sleeping now, which they are perfect for because i\\'m never too hot or cold in them. very thin and soft material, but yet pretty durable. would purchase again! perfect pants. keeps baby cozy and comfortable. no more losing socks and waking up cold. i would have given 5 stars if available in more colours they fit perfectly, they\\'re super comfy and now i can wear my hp house with pride! before buying, make sure you get the right size.<br />these pants are not only comfortable but amazing to dance in too!<br />not even dancing, working out, pajamas, and more!<br />i highly recommend this. boys can have it too! i actually have these pants in newborn, 3 months and 6 months (baby shower gifts). :) and i do love each size i have. they fit my daughter great. wash wonderfully and match a lot of her outfits. the ruffle on the bottom is adorable! love love these capris. they have been great for use when walking on the treadmill, as it becomes quite warm in my living room quick. i would suggest to anyone else buying, however, to wash them before wearing. i found that the black color rubbed off on my skin (easily came off in shower). kind of a given with any new pants, just passing along the tip! great it is a little big i really could have used an sx but then pajama pants are supposed to be. these aren\\'t as breezy as i thought they would be  but still nice and comfy. i love it, it arrived at a reasonable time and it fits well. you can\\'t however wear any bright undergarment as it would be shown. other than that its great. this is my favorite outfit to just put on and go!! i love it!! the material is breathable and prefect for when it\\'s hot outside.. i will be ordering another from this seller!! as a real testament to how nice these pants are, my 16 year old daughter keeps trying to steal them from me!  i was pleasantly surprised that these fit as well as they did and very happy with the olive color.  sometimes when clothes are an olive, they are kind of a dull icky looking olive, but i really like these joggers in olive.  the only reason i\\'ve given them 4 stars is because they are a little too long for my 5\\'2\\\\\\\\\" legs.  they fit my daughter perfectly though!  if petite sizes were available, i would definitely give them a 5.  the material is  really nice, not flimsy, but yet they have some give, so these pants are very comfortable.  i received this product in exchange for my honest review and i recommend these joggers for anyone 5\\'4\\\\\\\\\" and taller! i really like those pants!! fit is great.  the buttons for the pokets on the back had a tendency to fall off, but it was great.  still have them. cute, cute, cute!!!  smart buy.  nice fit. i love these pants, they are absolutely to die for. plus my boyfriend loves them too! for having curves, these are amazing! my girlfriend is smoking hot in these.  but they don\\'t look nearly as good on my wife.  highly recommended. sadly need to return- run big- other teez- her i wear large- but- these r way too big- all over- do not hold me in- baggy even in thighs.<br />price is good- i found same pants- only in grey in an area boutique for 49.00- i tried the med and they did not hold me in either- i did buy those at that inflated price cause i wanted grey- but- if i could return those i would- this style just does not work- like the other teez her pants- that i love- ( the leggings) i love the color and fits as expected too! awesomeness. they are perfect. husband likes that fact that there is a zipper fly.they are very warm and wash very well. love these!! super comfy! love these pants.  i am going to order more.  great for teaching kindergarten in on a daily basis. i\\'m always wary of buying juniors clothing even if plus sizes are available since you never know what you\\'ll get. i normally wear a size 18/20 depending on the brand and this was my first time ordering from this company. after reading reviews i went with the 22 plus. they are so comfortable. i probably could have gone with the next size down if i wanted a closer fit, but overall i wasn\\'t swimming in loose fabric. they are not jeans, but thicker than tights or leggings so i can wear them at work. they did get a little loose in the waist/butt after the course of the day, but not to the point that they were falling off (or looking like diapers as i\\'ve seen others have happen) and since i wear longer tops i doubt it was noticeable anyway. i wish there were some real pockets but otherwise i\\'m very happy i got these and will be trying others from wallflower. love these! super soft and feels like undies so child w not feel free like to wet bed in pull ups or diapers this outfit is awesome quality.  i was very pleased when it came. there was some trouble with the shipment. it came late, and i wasn\\'t able to wear the leggings for a show. i contacted the seller, and they gave me a second pair of silver leggings as consolation. although i was sad not to have them for the show, they gave me what i asked for! i\\'m very happy with their prompt response and ability to listen to my needs. great customer service! very human. the pants don\\'t really look like the image provided. in the image above, you don\\'t see any drawstrings (which are on the real pants, they\\'re long, flat, and white) and the way the tie dye looks is not the same, however the pants are still beautiful and comfortable so ya might as well get them. if you\\'re short like me (5\\'2), then find someone who can sew because the medium sized pants were like 6 inches too long for my legs. package arrived in a decent amount of time, i\\'ve already washed and dried them; there was no color bleeding or shrinkage. my best jeans it was a gift for a good friend....and he loved it. and the price was good too!!...thats all i cann say very nice! i bought these for my elderly mother who is in a nursing home and she loves them!! she used to say she would only wear hanes but they stopped making these with pockets so i thought i would give these a try. i cannot believe the quality difference!! very soft, pliable fabric, very well made. my mother, who i had expected to tell me she didn\\'t want them because they weren\\'t hanes, was over-the-moon happy with them. and everybody knows, if momma\\'s happy....everybody\\'s happy! being a family of pirates its important that or breeches are covered in a fashionable yet practical way.  these pants are perfect for partying and pillaging and for posing.  we have 5 pairs! these have been a great help in our quest of potty training. they fit well and have just the right amount of absorbency. i plan to order another set. awesome, they fit me just fine. this fit a lot shorter on me than on the model.  i am 5\\'2\\\\\\\\\" and these fall right above the ankle.  i just cuff these and wear them as cropped.  other than that, they fit great.  tight around the butt and thighs but not too tight in the waist.  they are low rise pants.  in case you are wondering how they would fit on you, note i am about 112 lbs and wear a size 0 (or up to a size 3 in juniors) these were a perfect fit and exactly as pictured my granddaughter loved them thank you nice quality, affordable baby clothes. very soft pants and great colors! happy with my purchase (: hopefully my friend\\'s baby will love them! love them, like all colors.... fits as expected..... have & will get more... have gotting my friends to buy this. between the time i ordered these and the time i received them i had forgotten that these slacks had an elastic waistband. i thought this would be a problem, but i\\'ve found that with a shirt that covers the waist band, they look very good. they have an excellent seam pressed into the legs that makes them look much more attractive than i thought they would be with an elastic waistband. also they don\\'t give me a \\\\\\\\\"bubble butt\\\\\\\\\" like some elasticized slacks would. the sizing is perfect which almost never happens. since i am short i inevitably find that slacks i buy are too long for me. these are wonderful in how they fit. go for it and buy these. they are cute it is true that upon my ordering a medium track suit... i received an extra-large. really.<br /><br />it is also true that the seller promptly refunded my entire purchase price, to include return shipping.<br /><br />it is true that the seller, on its own accord, sent me a small track suit (i did mention i was interested in the small as well) as to apologize for my inconvenience.<br /><br />the small fits excellently, although smaller than other small suits i have from other sellers. i am 5\\'5 and weigh 105 pounds.<br /><br />i am extremely happy with this suit and happier with the excellent customer service of cordiu. great yoga pants. a little long on me but otherwise nice fit and very comfy. i bought the size 9 in shark ones for my son who wears a size 8 in everyday clothes to give him a little room but the pants and shirt fit tight. the sleeves of the shirt are short and he continues to pull on the sleeve trying pull it down some. the pants are the correct length but again they fit to the body almost like they are girl pj\\'s. the material is the softest and very comfortable feel and the color is exactly what is pictured and they are very cute.  i would buy these again but definitely get two size larger than what they typically wear. very nice lounge pants. a little pricey but still a decent buy. i read the reviews so i did size up. i rarely wear a small but it fit very perfect... i\\'m glad i didn\\'t order the extra small. it is very nice and looks really classy. love them !!! cute undies.  baby girl loves them. i ordered these as a gift for a friend.  she loves them!  says they are extremely comfortable and loves the style!  only drawback,  more colors, in her size! everything came in perfect condition with great packaging! there was even a free pair of adorable earrings that came with as a free gift for shopping :) the material is very delicate, the pattern\\'s great, and it\\'s very chic! i definitely recommend this for anybody looking for a cute pair of leggings at a great price. very comfortable. continue to be useful postpartum. the legs were wider than the picture shows but i do like the pants. great! loved these. very unusual print. got lots of compliments. i love leggings so these were perfect. i\\'m here to buy more. i love the material, it\\'s so soft and flowy, the top folds over perfectly and they are just the right length being able to adjust them with the top.  love them!  thank you :) i bought this for my daughter and they fit her perfectly. we did some guess work on the size. based off the reviews. good quality not shiny. nice cotton feel. i really like this but definitely check the sizing and order one or two sizes larger than you normally wear.  very comfortable, soft and good quality. the material is pretty soft after washing, but the pants did shrink after putting them in the dryer. they are a bit tighter but i can still wear low heels with them. they\\'re basic black pants that can be dressed up or down and because i wear them so often i think i got a good deal. great pants, great price.  love that they are adjustable!  thank you!! these are just great looking pants and very unique. i get so many compliments on them. overall i like these. not too fond of the stripe down the side of the leg to be honest but it isn\\'t all that bad. i did think they were sized a bit large. i didn\\'t notice the pants had a back elastic or i would have sized down quite a bit.the fabric is thick and sturdy looking though..i just had to wash them before wearing to get rid of the stiffness. love this pants. the fit is perfect; i was totally surprised, and happy with this purchase.<br />the pants is well made, with good material. i am 5\\'3&#34;, and wear a size 4; i ordered the size small which is perfect. i will have to roll the hem though. they\\'re a lot better than walmart lol i love the thickness of these training underwear, i just wish they weren\\'t so costly! i ordered this product hoping it would help loosen the waistbands on my jeans and it has worked perfectly. one of the best things i have bought in a long time. saved me from having to go buy new jeans!! i have these pants for my boys in every color and every size because they love them so much!  so comfy love it i have to say. these pjs are super comfy. also you can buy them right now on sale at walmart in the juniors section for about ¬£6. yes there is walmart in britain!! love my tparty fold overs. they are smallish but that is why they look so good. they hold everything in and up. i am a 6-8 (5\\'5\\\\\\\\\") and the mediums fit me perfectly but i have to fold them up once since they are long. (like, a half fold?) i could still wear them 20 lbs higher this summer though.<br /><br />also - the thigh gap on this model is ridiculous. that is either airbrushing or a thinspiration inspired pic. i really think the model should be more realistic. very soft and perfect for a baby with eczema. they wash up nicely. these have fit for several months now! as described, as promised. good to go! these jeans did nothing for raising the booty, although i am giving them 5 stars because they are the most comfortable jeggings i have ever worn! they are amazingly stretchy, soft and comfy. i will be ordering more...as for the butt lift, keep doing your squats ladies. there is no miracle jean or legging. love the scrubs fits perfectlyz couldn\\'t be happier with the scrubs how comfortable are these?! the color and style is just so unique. i love them. i had to buy another pair =) love! true to size, great material and quality. always fast shipping. very nice. matches perfectly with the costume. i love buying items from luvable friends, great prices, quality and fits amazing for my son. these pants have been used the most out of all other brands. they haven\\'t shrunk at all and when they were alittle long for my son you can roll up the cuff looks very cute. the fabric haven\\'t faded, and with kids you wash alot :) i love these hot pants, although i expected them to be a bit more volleyball type pants, they are like my boyshort underwear, so no complaints even though they werent exactly what i expected. it was a gift...my niece loved it! it is very soft and  cute i love these pants. i work in maintenance and the horrible &#34;work-cut&#34; pants they provide are so uncomfortable i can\\'t use them. i would wear carpenter dungarees by carhartt but pur uniform colors are charcoal and navy. these are the best option in those colors. these have the double knee that holds up well over time and makes floor work easier. the straight leg cut and loose fit at the groin works awesome for carpenter-sized human. the cellphone pocket is a must and also great. my motorola smartphone vanishes when i drop it in. i do wish the joint at the crotch was  double material also as i walk a lot at work and this spot seems to be the achilles heel. i\\'ve never had it tear but i wear through this spot after a year or so wearing one-two times a week. still pretty good 400-800+ hours. these are the only work pants i wear and to keep stock i buy a new pair about every 90 days. love them!!! very satisfied loved, loved. loved these.<br />really great jeggings,<br />i will definitely be purchasing again in the future! :3<br />soo happy!! :) nice prefect fit, love them the leggings are a thick material, which is nice.  the skirt is very fitted/form-fiting and is the length depicted in the picture. i was familiar with this style of pant as i already have a pair in another color.they are a nice fit, a nice pant material too. bought theses as a gift. i thought they looked great on her. she felt they were too small. she normally wears a size 4-6. wearing yoga pants or leggings is new for her. we still haven\\'t decided if i\\'m exchanging or returning. i do recommend these pants. they have great elasticity and quality appears very good. my son was nervous to make the change from diapers but clearly no longer needed them. these were perfect for him, because they still gave him the feel of support only being able to take them up and down like his pampers, but with a cloth feel like &#34;big kid undies&#34; he still wears them once in awhile but now he also wears regular toddler undies too. these pants are comfortable and fit well. i ordered a medium for a 33 w 30 length and having no problems.<br /><br />pros - strap for under the foot so pants don\\'t ride up. form-fitting but not actual tights. good material that can wick some of the sweat away and allow breathability. zippered back pocket<br /><br />cons - small pocket, and only one.<br /><br />these pants are exactly as described and i\\'m inclined to put 5 stars b/c i knew about the lack of pockets on order and many people may like less pockets, but hopefully they read that i only deduct points for that. i just wanted some pants for relaxing or running and these fit the bill perfectly. i have owned them for almost a month now, probably 3 washes and 4 wears with no apparent wear yet, i love these pants!  they are way more comfortable than jeans and the cargo pockets come in very handy.  i may not wear jeans on a regular basis again.  the sizing chart also helped me pick out the right size. i really do like these pants. however, the color was a bit brighter than i was expecting, and the legs are a little too  baggy my hubby loves them!! got these for my babies, it was a great product and excellent value for money. she used it for along time and there were no signs of wear and tear i like the pants, but they do not fit as expected. they are too small. i recommend ordering one size larger. i was a bit wary buying these pants but they were very nice i will post an update if that changes, but top 5 pair i own. keep in mind it is a button fly not a zipper. great does it come in adult size? you will think this! this brand is so great- so soft and made with such an eye for quality. if there is anytime to buy a nice piece for your little one, this brand is it. you cant go wrong with all pieces but this one is my fave because it lasts so long- through so many sizes. they are so stretchy they can be worn for a long time and in hot or cold weather. good all around but not real fleece very stretchy and comfortable excelente producto i love these leggings so far! i\\'m a size 7 in jeans & they fit absolutely perfectly. and they\\'re way more comfy and soft than i expected them to be. just got them today. these are your typical neoprene work out gear - they really do make you sweat so be ready!  the length seems a little long for capris, and the first few wears are difficult to get on but as you move and break them in they will actually start to &#34;relax&#34;.  really good product and well made. what can i say? it is perfect. i wish all my pants fit as well as this. it is really classy looking also, especially with a furry white coat. i can see why it is named swiss alps because you visualize someone going to the ski lodge in these. they\\'re comfy and cute, but a little thin (see through) so i wouldn\\'t wear them out side of the house. the pant\\'s are great fit. the size (one sizes fit all is great). i love the color of the baggy pants.  the item arrived as expected. these are very nice pants for casual wear. going out in the cold weather with the family and such. definitely not for everyday working. the material is extremely light. nothing compared to regular, light, canvas carpenter pants. when it gets cold, i usually wear the guide gear fleece lined jeans from sportsmans guide. for $23 they cant be beat. i just prefer the canvas over denim so i gave these a try. these pants are very comfortable, but not built for the working man. true to size. great product these are definitely from china and have a very different take on body shape. very cute and racey shorts but did not anticipate the cut to not be accommodating for actual butts though. i bought two and my sister and i are both size 2-5 (depending on brand and cut) with around 25&#34; waist and 35&#34; hips... so we\\'re not big ladies. however the shorts squeeze in the wrong places if you don\\'t \\'customize\\' them (cuts slits on the bottom to bring circulation back to my thighs). also had to cut the button hole myself.<br />great pool shorts though and really sexy for cookouts and barely dressed summer things.<br />one of the pairs arrived very early so i threw in anpther star.<br />definately read all reviews before making your desicion. rugged, well-made pants with only one problem - the waist cinch doesn\\'t work, it loosens immediately when you try to tighten it.  i actually tied the elastic together and it works fine.  otherwise, great for playing (or working, yuck) in the snow. i wore it one time and i got alot of complements until they ripped....lol so comfortable and we\\'ll made! these pants are awesome. as the other posters recommended, i contacted the seller to see what size i should purchase, and got a response within two hours. apparently i\\'m an xxl, which i\\'ve never ever ever been, but who cares about sizes? they fit perfectly.<br /><br />i\\'m 5\\'3, 165, semi-athletic. my calves and thighs are muscular, a feature which has prevented my from buying skinny jeans since forever. these are my very first pair, and i am so happy with them.<br /><br />summary:<br />height: 5\\'3<br />weight: 165ish<br />hip size: (measured over my hip bones) 39-40 inches<br />size ordered: xxl super comfortable!! an awesome pant with a great cut and fit. i have purchased over a half-dozen more pants from this vendor and of this cut. peppa pants are a perfect fit! this did not fit as i expected it to but my baby is so tiny for her age so am not sure if i should have bought a smaller size. but it fits like loose track pants, it does not hug the body and give baby lots of space for movements. if you have an active baby like me it will be good for play time. this product is fabulous!!<br />it fits great, the material quality is excellent, the price was quite affordable & worth every penny spent.<br />i was concerned about the size, due to ordering other items the an anerexic mindget couldnt wear, yet, this product is perfect.<br />it runs a little big but, in a comfortable way, not droopy & unseemly, or a belt across the waste can work with it. looks great on & can be worn on a formal occasion, to an interview, church, an evening out with a date or just to be laid back & comfortable.<br />thank you for such a great product. :) these are so soft and stretchy and flattering. these may not work well on shorter people though. the most comfy pants! they said online they would be loose and light and i love them! perfect for a leisure night out for dinner in the desert heat! i use periodically pajamas and this is the most comfortable i\\'ve used. worth a try. soft and silky. nice, excellent touch. great baby wear. soft and darling these pants were exactly what i was looking for; the fit and length are perfect! i am 5\\'8, 185 lbs, pear shaped, waist about 31 inches and hips about 45 inches and i ordered a size l in several different patterns and all of them fit the same. the material is very stretchy and nice and thick, but not too thick. it is light and airy and will conform to any body shape. on me, it fits snugly in the waist down through my hips until about mid thigh and then it\\'s loose and flowy. this is exactly how i wanted mine to fit. and they are pretty long; they are long enough to wear with heels but i will have to try to pull them up a bit to wear with flats otherwise i would walk all over them. these are definitely going with me on vacation to the beach! love this with an ac tshirt for a good pair of pj\\'s. i really like the feel and the look of them. first time buying a l\\'ovedbaby product and will definitely buy more.  the pants look really good on the baby and they appear to be quite comfortable for him.  i intend to purchase various colors and sizes in these pants. these pj bottoms are amazing!  they are so soft and so warm.  i could wear them all day!  they really are very comfy! the cut is inaccurate but i saw that from previous reviews and ordered accordingly!  definitely affordable at least. these are my new favorite pants.  i wear them every chance i get and i have lots of other pants.  i am 5\\' 4&#34; and they touch my shoes in front and back.  so comfortable, very stretchy.  recommend to anyone not too tall. gf loves emmmmm some of the stitching seemed to be out. lots of strings. not that bad though. i like the color and fit and it arrived on schedule. i think i already reviewed these pants, but just for good measure, i repeat, they are great pants for the average misses size 10, great for work or casual wear, very comfortable and stain resistant. these were great and fast shipping. problems i ordered a 18, and while the plastic bag they came in had a sticker that said size 18, the pants inside were size 16. i can still squeeze in them so kept them anyway. i have dis-proportionally long/ thick legs and am 5\\'11. the length is great. if you fear pants running too high up, these are the pants for you. covers to just above the ground. thank you! received delivered within 1.5 weeks.<br />opaque and feel great on!<br />reach my ankle bones (5\\'3\\\\\\\\\" and 125 lbs).<br />i ordered \\\\\\\\\"blue\\\\\\\\\", and they are a true royal blue.<br /><br />overall couldn\\'t be happier and planning on ordering more colors! i\\'m usually a size 1/2... and ordered pants from the same brand before but these are way too small. i\\'m just going to add elastic in the waist to fix my issue. great product! i always order a size up in these leggings, and they fit great. definitely recommended! i adore these leggings! the fit is perfect. the material is comfortable and soft. and they look super great on me! the shipping was faster than expected and i\\'m super impressed! my teenager ordered this and wears it everyday. it was easy to size to his waist and i cannot wait to get my own soft kitty belt! these pants are very cute. i love the color. i am hesitant to order pants online because i don\\'t know how they are going to fit. depending on what store i go to and material used i can range from a size 12-16. i purchased these in a size 16 and they are a little too small. they fit right at your hips. they do stretch, but not too much around the waist. i am not going to return these because i am determined to fit into these. i would purchase pants from this seller again. love these pants. super soft and comfy. buyer beware, i am a size 0-2 and they fit me like a glove, so they must run small. great feel and comfortable got as a gift for my mother she liked them a lot fit well and where great for her trip up north. i purchased these as pj pants and love them. lightweight and so soft. fit is as chart reads. i am 5\\'5&#34; with 39&#34; hips and purchased the large. i wil be buying more! nice cotton blend wish they had more alfred dunner in cotton blend instead of the 100% poly. sometimes tall or long sizes are not exactly perfect fits . these pants are close to perfect super cute and well made!<br />three great pieces work well together or put together the hoodie with jeans. buy it! so comfy i am very impressed with this wallet chain i think the fact that its black is really cool and it actually has some weight to it good quality workmanship for the price you can\\'t go wrong 5 stars two thumbs up ! more like a babies large. these pants ran true to size and the fit is very nice. right amount of lycra, color is nice. these pants could be worn almost anytime for casual wear. for her great and look great, just a little too long. she is 5\\'3&#34;, and i got her a medium. would be perfect if it was two inches shorter. fast service and lovely pants. i absolutely like them. im curvy 5\\'6&#34; 145lbs and i ordered  2 large in burgundy and cobalt blue; it fits like a glove and enhances my figure. i placed 2 more orders in black and red this time xl so there will be more room. i have always been happy with my purchases from ellazhu and particularly their policies.  they have worked with me on sizing and exchanging, etc.  however, now that i have purchased quite a few items from them, i know how things fit and what i need to order size wise.  the best part of ellazhu items is that they are so unique.  i get many compliments on my clothes from them...this item is no exception!<br /><br />i did have to stitch the bottom part of the pocket...however, it was after an evening of dancing - not that they came that way!  i would definitely buy from ellazhu again! love these pants even though the small media pocket no longer included great quality but way too long. i bought two pairs of these fleece lined leggings so i would always have a pair available. i love them and they are very comfortable. they will be great to have for next winter season. most comfy pants ever!! of course i bought them for myself because i love loki...i\\'m 5\\'9 and female and these are a great length. the large fits loose enough for lounging pants. awesome product!!! thanks, marvel. :-) these pants almost fit perfectly and the material is really thin and soft. they are very long in the leg however, as i have a 29&#34; inseam usually. also, don\\'t expect your skin to be able to breathe--it\\'s sweaty despite how thin the cloth is, but they\\'re almost all polyester, so that\\'s normal. i bought these for my daughter. they were a great fit and she loves them. they are a bit long, because she is only 4\\'11&#34;, but i would definitely recommend them for the hard to fit. a petite option would have been perfect! i gave these pants as a gift.  they were liked very much...nice fabric and fit well but a seam fell apart after the first washing.  i hope this will be made right.  the person will be reporting the problem. i gave them the order number to contact amazon about the problem. just what i expected. i love it. thies are very sexy pants and the fit nice and they dont fall off your tush. very very sexy pants ‚ù§Ô∏è good pants, but i bought the wrong size! had to return for a regular size 14. as others have mentioned, these pants are good for people with small waists and big hips. very happy now i have the correct size! arrived & very pleased with my new linen pants. love them fit is fantastic  could not be happier with them would buy another pair when i would need to replace fit my boyfriend\\'s daughter just right love them! i really love them the fit perfect and their comfortable. my friend and i purchased these to wear as \\'shorts\\' under our tutus for halloween. the shorts are a spandex-y stretch material that is extremely comfortable and does not ride up or move around once it is on. the shorts matched our leg avenue tutus perfectly, and provided full coverage throughout the night. comfortable, cute, and long enough! i love these scrubs. they are very comfortable and look nice.<br />they also come out of the washer and dryer ready to wear with no wrinkling i love these yoga pants! they\\'re comfy and flattering. fabric is thin and there are no pockets. i still like them because i grew up watching this show and i look ridiculous wearing these but i don\\'t care. i love these pants! i ordered 3 pairs to start, and the fit great.  i\\'m 5&#34;6 and 150lbs and i ordered a large. the length is great, their not long like most people posted previously , and the fabric is a good quality cotton.they are not see through like others have posted ,( make sure to order a size up, otherwise your might have a see through problem.) the fabric is nice a stretchy, and holds true to its shape, they don\\'t stretch out or pucker out. i love them so much that i\\'m buying three more colors! :) highly recommended. i bought it for my wife and she just loved it . . . she says that the quality is very good and very comfortable ! ! ! a little bit long and the color is slightly darker than shown, otherwise a good fit. i ordered for my husband he like bruce lee stuff an he loves it , it came from china an came a few days early. the material is nice an silky. comfy, perfect fit, got complimented on these plants a lot!  went great with a lot of shirts. very good material, it didn\\'t shrink at all, so i know my lil guy will be wearing it for a while. also great price for this set. this is the second pair of these pants i have and i bought them, because i liked so much the smaller size. i like the footed style - my son plays with his feet a lot and socks never stay in their place longer than few minutes. i like quality: this is probably the only organic cotton piece of clothes in our household - i am not \\\\\\\\\"an organic person\\\\\\\\\", but the fabric is really good quality - durable (i have washed the previous pair of pants many times and looks still very nice and keeps its shape) and still soft and pleasant to touch.  (i only wish i could get the cut i am used to from europe, where babys pants dont have a rubber band at waist, but have closing over shoulders - kind of pants + a tank together :-)  ) i read complains of other reviewer, that pants were too short. i didnt have that problem. and waist rubber band is spaceful even for my 18 pounds 6 months old. these pants are pretty see threw but if you wear black or white underwear with them you will be okay. i am almost 5\\'3 and these were supper long before i washed them. once i washed them they shrank a little. still long but have no problem wearing with flip flops jus don\\'t wear them on a rainy day! super cute and super comfy i bought these for my son.  he likes them alot.  i\\'m assuming that they are comfortable on him considering he refused to wear pull ups after we tried these on for the first time.  these have really worked well for us.  after a couple of months of wearing these, he pretty much potty trained. just received these today and the material it is made of is just like the zagorra hot pants.  i have both brands and the only difference is the price.  these are much more affordable and fit very well.  its made of neoprene which is a bit stretchy but comfortable to work out in.  and yes, you will sweat a lot more with them on.<br />i wear size 10/12 and decided to get a size medium based on reviews.  i find them to fit snug but i prefer it that way.  the inner lining is a bright yellow. they are not as long as i want them to be but for the price, its still a good deal. i love these pajamas! the medium fit me perfectly. i normally wear a size 6 in slacks and am a slightly bigger size on top. i love that these have short sleeves and the sleeves don\\'t snug on my arms, but they are close to it, if the top was any smaller the sleeves would be snugging when i more my arms around. i bought these because they are so different. and, that\\'s what i\\'m all about! these are awesome! fit great...can be dressed up or down, and are multi-seasonal! love...love...love! these are the best.  my 3-year-old son has been toying with them for a few weeks now, and two nights ago he told me he is all through with diapers (pull-ups).  these are great for the little \\\\\\\\\"timing\\\\\\\\\" issues associated with early potty training efforts.  very thick.  i have three sizes because initially i was thinking they would be a little skimpy as some training underwear i\\'ve seen, but i think they are pretty true to size.  i notice they stretch a little as my son is wearing them.  he is 40 pounds (yeah, really tall), and though the x-large is within his weight range, i am ordering a new pack of large for him. they were too small, but that means i\\'ll have to put more time in the gym to get into them. flexible, fit well on me. i am 5\\'5\\'\\' and a pant size 1-3. flow beautifully when i dance, perfect length for me, haven\\'t tripped on them yet. good the straps are some what unhandy but if you can tolerate that they are certainly warm. i am 5\\'9&#34; and the medium long fits best. fit perfectly, looks as depicted on their web site. shipping was prompt.<br />washed well.  no complaints from me, only complements received from others. was a birthday gift and he love how they fit seeing other \\'baby pants\\' listed as so much more expensive for 1 pair vs. 3, i figured i\\'d give these a shot to see the quality. they have been washed & dried, and held up beautifully. the material doesn\\'t feel cheap, it really is a great buy! would recommend. my grandson now has the shirt and pants. the outfit runs small so buy a size larger. i had to return twice at my own expense. very good sweats these were perfect for potty-training my little one.  they are thicker than regular underwear, and therefor more absorbent.  they fit well and did not leave any skin irritation at the seams around the legs. pant length is too long. i love this item because it is so soft and looks so comfortable.  i have a few other items by this brand and love them as well. the fit was perfect. i thought they would hold a leak a little better but then again they are training pants. i love these pants!! they look better than what i expected, fit great and sexy as heck! black shirt to match a must. my friend loved them so much i had to let her wear them. the men in our lives loved them also. that says something when a man comments. a must in anyone\\'s wardrobe! good! a little baggy but will wear for a while they fit very nice on my wife, we liked them a lot. may be ordering another set in a different color. nice pants! love these yoga pants! they\\'re so cute and comfortable got in the mail today. can\\'t wait to wear them! looks like good quality and the wait wasn\\'t that long. thanks so these pants are really cool! got them a adult small size, im about 5\\'6\\\\\\\\\" and they fit me good, the only flaw is that these pants i do not recommend wearing them in the summer, i had them on for about 2 minutes and my legs began to sweat like crazy. but overall i like these pants. they fit perfectly, i love them. when i first bought them i didn\\'t know how they were going to fit, but they are great. thank you! great costume, fit is almost perfect in size large for me.  actually arrived pretty fast when coming from shanghai, china.  good quality, worth the price. very sexy, and fun to wear.  will have to layer up in the winter season, though.  the design compliments my legs. they are fine just be aware that for larger new borns (7lbs and up) this product will only last a few weeks.  i would size up to be able to use it for 3 months. great! i really do love these. i am more on the petite side, and often like the style of more &#34;juniors&#34; clothing. i spotted these, purchased them, and really enjoy their fit and feel. they have a slight sheen which makes them dressier, but they are still comfortable and not too boxy. i also normally wear straight leg pants, but the slight taper on these does make them nice for flats, and it is small enough to easily tuck into boots. win, win. ;-) so comfortable for my little baby. they fit her perfect since she is tall and slender my son loves these themals...to play in or to sleep.  he says they are very comfortable.  he is 6 years old. fit great ! look good in it.. love the pants and price!! it was very comfortable and fashionable! these come right below my knee - i was wanting them to be a little longer, but i still like the pants! i love em! they are great for medieval era or for pirate-themed outfits. light so they are a great choice for summer. these pants are so cute and comfortable.  i love them. i have only used these once so far but i completely loved my workout while in them. i went for a run and hadn\\'t worked out in almost 2 months... these get you nice and hot but not in an uncomfortable way. i live in florida and was running in 80 degree heat and while it was toasty, the pants don\\'t make you feel like you\\'re thrown into a furnace. my skin was very soft after the workout and taking a shower which was glorious. the one thing about these pants that i love even if they don\\'t blast cellulite is the compression they offer while working out. i have never worn compression pants before while working out so maybe they are all the same but what i noticed was the confidence i felt when i had them on. i\\'m very self conscious of any jiggle that i have while running and with those on, you just don\\'t feel your body move that way and you can completely focus on your workout which i found invigorating. with the amount that you sweat while working out in these, i don\\'t see how they couldn\\'t improve a few dimples so i am excited to see how they work out long term. i highly recommend and even talked my best friend into ordering a pair based on my first experience. like paints everything they said it was. color is great, fits well, shipped on time and very comfortaable to wear. we are pleased with this purchase. the price was good, shipping was prompt and the quality is good. sizing was correct. the color was correct and stitching and workmanship are fine. thank you they are fitting really well. for some reason i thought the fabric was more jean like but it is more legging like. meaning is very elastic but they look very nice on me. recommended! omg is amazing thank u so much. its perfect! good quality,fits by size awesome fit! very stylish. can be put together with many different styles. recommend buying. i want a pair for myself.  i bought two and was so glad i did. i wish they made these in every size. the material is super comfortable, soft and smooth, and it fits my body so well! wearing this to yoga class and everyone was asking me where i bought this ‚ò∫ definitely will buy again. love it üòÑ i bought these because i wanted some yoga pants that would display my pregnant tummy for our maternity photo shoot.  these are so comfortable.  i wish i bought them earlier in the pregnancy.  i\\'m 5\\'6 and my pre pregnancy weight is about 145.  the medium fit me perfectly.  i think i\\'ll even be able to wear them post pardum since they are \\\\\\\\\"under belly\\\\\\\\\".  very cute and affordable. i bought these with a matching top for halloween. my only complaint was that they were too high-waisted for me, but that was an easy fix. fit great and made my costume! these are so great to keep the baby warm and show off their diaper butts!! the baby always gets noticed whenever he\\'s wearing them! i have not seen these anywhere else, i\\'m definitely going to get more! the material is a comfortable blend of cotton and lycra. highly recommend these!! the seller is great, has plenty of different sizes available, the free and fast shipping doesn\\'t hurt too! i put four stars because i really did love this outfit. it was flowy and pretty and awesome - but before i even went out for the first night i was going to wear it, all of the beading fell apart, and i mean fell apart. the beading went everywhere. so that was really disappointing. these leggings are great, the color is gorgeous and the fabric is thick (but not too much) and not see through (great for rock climbing too).<br />but they are a bit too large, that\\'s the only thing... i\\'m 5\\'9&#34; and 132 lb, and should have taken a small instead of the medium and unfortunatly it seems that there isn\\'t any more small ones, looks like i won\\'t be able to change them (?)<br />however, they\\'re ok if i i fold over the waist band :) very cute pants. the waist was a little snug for my 5mth old but everything else fit fine. this is our second time purchasing these pants because my grandson is growing...they are comfortable, always look fresh, minimal shrinkage in dryer, elastic on waist is soft, the bottom cuffs keep them from riding up too high for a baby who is now learning to crawl, nice prints and colors...will get some more as he grows.  good product. my daughter loves them i love this sleeper. its fabric is made from bamboo, a renewable resource, and is so soft and silky. it washes beautifully (trust me). i love the mitten cuffs to keep my little one\\'s hands warm and from scratching her face. i liked this so much i bought a second one. pricey, but worth every penny. just what i expected great fit i love them!<br />i work in homecare nursing just what i need for overnights tough and sturdy, thick pants. i\\'ve washe them half a dozen times thus far with no fading. they run a bit small, waist-wise, so adjust for that. i ordered these in beige stripe. the pants are a nice material and style but they run small. i have been wearing size small maternity pants. i ordered small in these and have found them to be tight. exactly what i expected; shipped quickly. my son was so happy to get these and 11 months later, they are still going strong. i love these pants. i just had a baby and these pants look great on a post baby body. the only reason i am not giving these pants 4 stars is because the material sort of felt like work out clothing. they don\\'t look like work out clothing though. my daughter has been wearing these since she started potty training at around 22 months.  she is about 2.5 now and still wearing the 18 month size.  she is a little small for her age and still has some room to grow in these.  she has warn some different brands and styles home after an accident at a friend or relative\\'s house and she asks to put these on as soon as she can instead.  they seem to really comfortable to her. the pants were terrific, they fit my husband properly and there was minimal shrinking and fading in the wash. i got 100 for 18 months and its a little small it fits my 12 month old. its very cute i love it. and my son looks adorable in it. i woukd reccomend and would buy it again love the pants! there so comfortable! my marine loves them nice pj\\'s.  may buy another in different  color. excellent product. bought three pair. very comfortable. shipping took longer than expected, but worth the wait. very comfortable and patriotic. they worked exactly for what i needed them for. i don\\'t wear them much now, but they are great for international sporting competitions and tournaments. represent! loved this they fit just fine and i loave wereing then out... and now my kid wants a pair of them great nypd lounge pants, great seller perfect for under skirts!! best yoga pants ever for the price ! i\\'m never going back to any other yoga pants. well worth the money spent. our baby has a huge head (like 99 percentile) and this is the only hat that will fit him. fyi: you can\\'t really leave it on unattended, because it tends to come down over the face a little bit given enough squirming. i\\'m very happy with the $4 price on these pants. that makes them worth the alterations i\\'ll do myself on the irregular lengths. each one of the three i ordered (all mediums) is different in length and even waistband. still, i can pull them on, and the stretch makes them easy to wear. great for around the house and exercising. soft and lightweight. fits my 8lb, 21in newborn perfectly. love the fleece on the inside of the footies. holding up to being washed and dried daily so far with very minimal piling. these are soft and durable and wash well. very comfortable. i appreciate the elastic waistband. i\\'m a 5\\' 9\\\\\\\\\" female so i have to get extra large for the length. i\\'m extra large enough myself (170 lb) that the fit is okay, if a bit swimmy. i can wear the larges when i\\'m a little smaller (160) but they all shrink maybe an inch in length in the wash. these are the best flannel jammie pants i\\'ve found so far and customer service is great. colors are true to the pictures...at least for the violet and the red. nice for yoga and lounge i love them. glad i found some in my size. hard to find cute clothes in larger sizes.  they shipped fast and even threw in some socks. love it very nice fit.  nice fabric, ver comfortable.  unfortunately, i ordered two pair of pants and both had holes in it.  couldn\\'t return them since i live in central america. perfect!!! fits well, hold everything in place, looks like it\\'s a pair of jeans and it\\'s super comfortable. the most comfortable ppants ever! fits perfectly . always love teeki pants. i look forward to showing these off and getting my girlie the slytherin gear. let\\'s be clear, these are pajama pants not sweat pants. we have a big yard and the dog needs a walk morning, noon or night. when the snow is knee deep, this pant comes to rescue you think anybody wants a roundhouse kick to the face while i\\'m wearing these bad boys? forget about it. :d great fit.  great style.  just the right amount of draping and love the wide waistband.  i will buy a 2nd pair. i didn\\'t expect these leggings to be high quality by any means. i\\'ve bought fleece leggings from a department store before and the waist band was so loose they\\'d sag when i walked. i was praying that this wasn\\'t the case and it isn\\'t! they fit very nicely and the fleece makes it feel like your wearing pajama pants. i\\'m wearing them to a pretty chilly notre dame game and i can\\'t wait to stay warm with these! came just as described and fast enough to be wrapped and placed under the christmas tree by santa\\'s...helper!  wife loves them and gives them up grudgingly on laundry day but they come back soft, warm and snugly from the dyer so she is okay with that. it fits smaller than i expected love these! comfy and fit as expected. like other reviews, the legs are a little long as they are men\\'s pants, but it wasn\\'t much of an issue for me. (i\\'m 5\\'7&#34; and bought the xl). i want to get the other hp ones as well! did not feel like they would be water proof but they worked.  way too long. so soft! it is lightweight and extremely soft. i wish the button at the back of the neck was a snap, but that is a minor detail. i love these. they are a great substitute for leggings... still fitted and stylish, but thicker with backside detailing. these are appropriate for work, etc. whereas regular leggings might not be. very pleased with these! also, i sometimes wear a 30 in guess, sometimes a 31, but the 30 in these fit me very well. so when in doubt, order the smaller size. love these! i used this hat for my 1 year old\\'s pumpkin costume. the knot on top was perfect!  the material is thin, so this isn\\'t a hat to use outside in cold temps. very cute and high quality hat. very comfortable pants. i\\'m glad i got the large. roomy without being too large/bulky high quality, comfortable and just what was expected. these were just what i was looking for!  brand new and in perfect condition. these pants look amazing, feel amazing, and they don\\'t stretch out easily. they work wonderful for dedicated active pants or pants to complete your days activities in. i will most likely be buying these in another color. nothing flimsy about these buttons. uncle sam would approve of them. buy a hundred‚Äî find 20 friends to share with. absolutely awesome, it came on time and there were no holes or anything. it was really worth the cash i paid for it. these pants just rock!  they are stylish, comfortable, and very well made.  i was really impressed by the high quality of these pants for the price.  they also arrived super fast.  i actually got them maybe two days after i ordered them.  i will be back to buy more from ellazhu.  their harem pants are awesome! fits a little small i gave this to my girlfriend as a gift and she loves them i have to by this again soon. i thought the pants were well fitted. i am nearly an exact size 4 in american standard size and i do not like vanity sizing. the small seemed to work fine in terms of overall fit. i have only worn them for one yoga session and i liked them. they were comfortable, had a high waist, (which i need for yoga especially since i am tall) and the material was comfortable and not see through at all. i wish the seller was part of amazon prime as i did not appreciate the shipping cost. great for winter in cold places. that was an unexpected bonus. they are fine, but i guess my legs are on the small size so i need to sew that part tighter but,they fit fine and i like the way my butt look in them. i gave this 4 stars because the legs were a bit open but hey..i\\'ll buy from them again...the price was super. shipping i think was  about three days...i\\'m happy...a very good buy. i\\'m happy with them but they are pretty transparent. this is my new favorite piece. works well with flats,  wedges, and pumps. works well but runs a big, order a smaller size.  there is a noise that the pants make but with all the noise in the gym it\\'s not noticeable.  i highly recommend it if you like to sweat. love these. very happy with purchase these pants and shirt made me look epic on the airsoft field. i reccomend them with a balaclava, black tactical vest or maybe some elbow and knee pads. if u arent going to buy the whole set of bdu camo, u should definetly reconsider. it works great indoors and surprisingly well outdoors. i\\'m really happy with this product. the length is what i always have problems with with other workout pants.. these are long enough! just perfect! :) they\\'ve survived one wash, but i have a few doubts about the material\\'s quality.  but the fit is great, and the first time i wore them i got &#34;have you lost weight?&#34; comments, which made me even more partial to the pants. this item is exactly as advertised.  they fit well, and were delivered in a timely manner. best pants ever the design is beautiful.  i love wearing these pants, but i feel a little concerned that they might not stay on in some yoga classes.  i have other yoga pants that fit better. love these. cant wait to get a few more pairs let me start out by saying that i now own 4 pairs of kalon yoga pants and leggings. these are by far the most comfortable yoga pants i have ever bought, and i will be buying more. the material is absolutely amazing. so soft, comfortable and stretchy. you can buy 2 pairs of these for the same price of one at victoria\\'s secret and the quality is the same, if not, better. money very well spent. love these pants!!! so very cosy,yet stylish too....almost like a personal secret ,looks like dress pants, feels like comfy p.j.\\'s !!!<br />i\\'m 5\\'4, 125 lb.\\'s , bought med., loved then soooo much ordered another pair!!! still very cute~! just will have to wear as pants as the top does not stay up! very good perfect. good these are the bomb. the colour is cool and i like the ripped effect. i also have in black. thanks! grand daughter loved it, it fit her alittle loose.  she is a size 0.  thank you absolutely love these gauchos!!!  this is my third pair & will definitely be getting a few more colors. they are very comfortable and fit true to size! perfect to dress up or down! these are a nice heavier weight and fit really nice.  i bought two pair of these and he loved them both. i love these pants. they fit nice, they arrived on time, and they look cool. the only thing that kept me from me giving this item a 5 star is the stitching on the left pocket started to unravel. but i just stitched it back. no problem since. i order up a size because the listing said to an they are a bit too large, but they are so comfortable and work so well that i\\'m not even going to bother to send them back for another size. this is such a great value, the over-pants are well constructed and feel like they will last a long time. i rode to work at 6 am in 34 degrees f and didn\\'t feel a single chill. 2003 zx12r @ 120-130 mph love these! they go  perfectly with my super woman shirt! also light and roomy. material breathes in the summer, making it a bit cooler. nice stats: 5\\'3&#34;, 135 lbs. i ordered the m/l based on prior reviews. material & construction were nice. the pants were far too high-waisted for me, coming up to the bottom of my bra! the fit was good otherwise. if i had gone down a size, the waist would have been too tight. returned. i love halloween and i always have to have an outfit to wear throughout the day until i put on my halloween costume that night.. so i decided to buy these leggings to complete my look, and they are awesome! i don\\'t have much to complain about when it comes to them. i would say that they bunch up a little bit at the ankles and i even pulled them up pretty high and i am 5\\'5 but eh, whatever i can wear my leg warmers with them to cover that up. now they are see through though so you will want to wear no underwear with them or wear black underwear and some black tight under them as well. i would recommend it to everyone, they are so so so so cool. :) awesome pants, shipping bit slow but no big deal. fit great and shows off those curves. i loved these so much i purchased all the pants in this brand. tried to save money by shopping at target but the fit was horrible, these are definitely worth the money. very comfortable this style of shorts are extremely comfortable. i ride a bike about 15 miles a couple times a week. still comfortable. 99% seam free. i live in midwest and needed warm up pants for outer layer in cool/cold months.  these are my favorites to layer with leggings.  keeps me warm on coldest of days walking the dogs. love these but had to order a size bigger.  i ordered the size i normally wear, but i had return for a size larger.  will be ordering many more  items from them now that i know what size i wear! fits well and is warm. very soft material. okay. seem to be losing a bit of elasticity already. that was not expected i have a pair of these pants and they are very nice quality.  not quite aerostich quality, but good nonetheless.  if you are long and lean the fit should be fine.  i have a 36\\\\\\\\\" waist and 30\\\\\\\\\" inseam.  the 36 waist is right on, but the pants were way too long.  i got them so cheap i had them altered by a seamstress and they are great. they are amazing!!!! nice i bought the goucho pants for my daugher (age 13) and she loves them.  she said they are very comfortable. there is no hem, which i think gives them a nice, \\\\\\\\\"flowy\\\\\\\\\" appearance.  they are also easy to wash. very good quality. good material. slightly tight waist. good permanent press (no wrinkles). after months of my daughter wearing this hat she still loves it. it fits great and is easy to clean. at a great price. she loves that big flat bill. its an awesome product that is made to last. 5&#34;2 120lbs got a small absolutly love itüòç great fit for me but i am on the short side 5 3\\' and 127 lbs. i bought these for hip hop and jazz dance classes i teach.<br />i liked them so much i also bought other color for wearing with heels and cute summer tops. super comfortable and<br />worth every penny. i really like the thin, soft material. great for spring and summer. cool costume pants.  not giving them 5* because the image quality isn\\'t as crisp as i was hoping - a bit blurry. these were just a bit more snug that i had hoped, but overall really happy with the pants. nice fit, nice quality and they didnt stretch out too much over the course of the day. i will not be drying these though. we\\'ve purchased 3 sets of these and our son has improved his potty training tremendously! after about a week and a half of hard practice, he doesn\\'t need to wear his cloth diapers anymore! these training pants are cute, soft, great quality and they wash easy. another great thing is they don\\'t take forever to dry, which is a huge plus. we\\'ll be moving on with the cloth diapers to our newborn now, and the bigger boy will be thriving in his bigger boy pants. we highly recommend parents to give these a try! these pants are great!  they are super comfortable, trendy, and, best of all, flattering!  they look great with a nice pair of sandals and a short-sleeved blouse.  i liked these so much i bought them in 3 colors!  i do think they run a little big - i bought a size smaller than i usually wear in old navy and lane bryant and they\\'re still roomy (but not baggy!) i bought a small for my girlfriend and she loved them because of the designs and she is 4\\'11&#34; and they were a little long but they fit well i\\'m short so these were too long i am 6\\'3&#34;, 168lbs,female with 36 inseam. the measured inseam on the med size is 32&#34; however the &#34;rise&#34; (crotch to waist) is long so they fit well over all .for me the hem falls 2&#34; above my ankle bone but is ok as i tuck the hem in my socks then boots over, i find it hard to find mens tall pants in a med size, usually the tall starts at large and i would be swimming in them so this is a compromise i love the red fleece lining, what\\'s with the fly issue? don\\'t womens jeans have a fly? these pants have no fly. i am going to buy another pair! be ready to sweat, material not very breathable so you will be sticky. very comfy and soft, looks great!! couldn\\'t find training pants anywhere and we wanted to use something other than pullups. these are perfect. thanks for making these easy to find and purchase. fantastic option to stay cool in south carolina muggy hot days....keep your legs bug free and the breeze blows right through these pants. get some. was amazing i finally found a perfect fit-wish it came in different colors.<br />i am quite pleased--- this outfit was fantastic for halloween. it so soft and comfortable. was like wearing pjs. fit perfect so comfy!! i bought two. i want more but that\\'s probably asking for me to wear them too much :) great product i\\'m 5 10 130 but have plenty of hips. i got a small but a medium would have fit better. they stretch so i\\'m keeping them. they are long enough which is nice. good material and comfortable. nicely priced i think. are so cute. i get compliments on them all the time.<br /><br />the other day, this older lady started rubbing my thigh and then pinched them and snapped them down and was like, &#34;what are these?&#34; lol. i\\'m pretty sure she was doing it in a motherly way but it was pretty funny. only in these leggings would something like that ever happen.<br /><br />they are comfy. they are worth the wait. great quality doesn\\'t shrink so soft love, love, love em... i like sporting mine with a fanny pack turned around to the front, along with a pair of my best air jordans.  if i really want to impress the ladies i\\'ll combo these great pants with a everlast boxing shirt (has to be sleeveless!).  if you are trolling for the ladies you can\\'t even think about putting your hooks in the water without wearing something this smooth. i bought these when i was traveling to central america and then proceeded to live in them. love them! these were a little baggy on our newborn at 9 pounds, but stayed on o.k. and will be nice as he grows. love and it\\'s super soft :) wish it had pockets but other than that its amazing! fit well, although i\\'d like if they were a bit longer, but that\\'s because am tall (5\\' 10&#34;) great to wear around the house or to work out. these are super comfortable and very lightweight!  i love them.  i got them for pajamas and they are perfect.  i\\'m considering getting the darker grey ones too just cause they are so cool looking.  great for loungewear too.  they are totally soft. bought for a family member.  they seem to like them.  soft.  a little on the thinner fleece side. fits wonderful great material i bought these for my dad. he has cancer and is really sick. he wanted more scrubs to wear like the ones from the hospital but i couldn\\'t get my hands on any of those so i searched for some that were soft and comfortable. these do the trick. customers, buy from darya trading, you will not be disappointed.  darya trading, my hats off.  not only an authentic valentino italian suit that looks and fits perfect, but a customer service team that truly honors and appreciates its customers!  you aren\\'t going to find a better dealer anywhere.  integrity is something rare in the consumer market, darya trading is a rare company.  thank you for this fantastic suit.  i earn a humble income working with the department of homeland security and it is great to know that i can still buy high quality clothes through sellers like darya trading.  the feeling of receiving the package, opening the box, and finding authenticity and quality far beyond expectation, its something i will always remember.  thank you darya trading, you\\'re the best!  joe i typically wear a woman\\'s xl-xxl (18-20 us size) and these fit me well, there a bit more snug in the hips and thighs and flare out, which is the &#34;palazzo&#34; style. i was expecting more of a spandex material and these are more cotton, but still look nice enough to wear for a night out. i pared them with a spandex cowl neck top and you can\\'t tell the difference in the fabric. arrived in 2 days (amazon prime shipping). will defiantly be purchasing more. pants fit great. i bought a similar pair years ago that are showing signs of age but still fit(i must be doing something right) i bought these for my 3 year old son who we had been trying to potty train for some time.  we decided to take away the pull ups completely because he just used them as diapers.  i found these that said they were absorbent and gave them a try.  they have worked well.  my only complaint is that they were very large on him so they bunch up in the back when he pulls up his pants.  he is a normal size 3 year old but i should have bought a smaller size for him. my son does not complain though, he seems to really like them, maybe because they are so loose they are comfortable.  he actually prefers these to normal underwear now that he is fully potty trained. i am 6\\'4&#34;, 175 pounds, and ordered the large. i must say the fit is spot-on (maybe a bit baggy, but i would have a hard time finding tight-fitting wranglers). my only gripe, and it\\'s relatively insignificant, is that they don\\'t insulate very well. my legs got a bit chilly this morning in 36-degree temperatures.<br /><br />overall, great item, fast shipping, and quality product. i wouldn\\'t hesitate to order another pair. i just received these as a gift for christmas from family friends who consulted my daughter on what size to buy me. i wear a women\\'s small, usually. my daughter thought medium would be the best bet based on the reviews, however i was ordered a small. yes they do hit low on the hip, but they fit me fine. i think it has to do with preference of how you wish to wear your pj bottoms. these look great, feel warm and are completely cute! i love them. these pants are very flattering and extremely comfortable. the only issue i had was that they are very long. i\\'m 5\\'8&#34; and even with 3&#34; heels i had to hem the pants due to constantly stepping/tripping on them. i hemmed them 3/4&#34; and they fit perfectly now. love the cargo pants. now i have a set of zumba outfit. love the material and its really comfortable. ‚ò∫ i am 5\\'7&#34; and 155lbs (bottom heavy) ordered a large. fits great, good quality, comfy, flattering but hugs you butt a little tight. i am more conservative in my clothing so i just bought a longer top to wear over them. very happy with purchase. btw not a huge bootleg like other brands. i love the coral color!! i was skeptical, but these shorts are actually super comfy. there is no scrunched waistband to be uncomfortable, and the material is soft too! these pants are extremely flattering and comfortable, with a nice thick elastic waistband. they\\'re excellent for women around the height of 5\\'2-5\\'4. very nice slacks for the price.  as reported in another review, very long for a petite but well worth altering as the fabric is very nice. they pants are just as described and exactly what i expected based on reading previous reviews. perfect fit for me: i have long legs and so need the long length that was discussed. the fabric is soft and comfortable, not at all binding at the waist. i do wear these around the house; the fabric is thin, but just thick enough that i could wear them out too. i would really love to have another pair just like these with heavier fabric, but this is not a complaint. i\\'m very happy w/ these. these are awesome! i\\'m a big girl i normally wear an 18/20 pant/top. given i have to pull them up a little high to wear them as pants because of my shape my rear is just a little too large, but once they\\'re up they are so cute. i just layered a tank and a nice shirt over where it sits on my tummy to camouflage,it looks great, so many complaints!!! this material  gets very wrinkley, but i\\'m an avid user of downy wrinkle release,works perfect. i\\'m getting these in every color. it\\'s like wearing a skirt, but without the rules of being ladylike. super bohemian.  looks great with boots or flops or flats or heels. and wearing them as a jumper is even cuter. you can totally dress it up with some strapy sandals and jewelry  and a shrug. i was afraid i would look like a huge trash bag, but i\\'m super impressed with how comfortable and cute this is!!  the first time i wore them out i was so nervous, the second i walked out i felt great. olive green, blue print, and black. all look great. cute it\\'s true...the pants definitely run long.  i am 5\\'7&#34; / 140 lbs and ordered a large - which they fit fine. not too &#34;crotchy&#34; and a nice double fold at the low tummy.  they fit how i want yoga pants to fit (not loose, but not so tight that i\\'m advertising).  they fit modestly snug. but they are long - not even, like, &#34;trendy&#34; long but an &#34;oh, i may need to get these altered&#34; long.<br />with the pants on, in my bare feet, the bottom drags on the floor - the kind of drag that would certainly get stepped on by the back of your shoes when walking outside - possibly leading to early wear and tear (and not the good kind of wear and tear, but the haggard, tattered, stepped on wear and tear).  i don\\'t know yet---i haven\\'t worn them outside yet, but they drag like a wedding gown train in bare feet.<br />having said that:  the color is good (i ordered navy).  the quality seems good.  it has a traditional, little emblem on the back that lands just above your tailbone that is not a distraction by any means.<br />i gave it four out of five stars because i simply cannot understand why the designers don\\'t take the pants up by 1 inch.  if they would do that, then these would be a great buy. i wear them all the time. very comfortable and easy to take care of. as expected. this set is so amazing in fact you &#34;could&#34; split it up and have several gifts!  very well made and absolutely adorable!! exelente servicio, recibido a tiempo y de buena calidad. solo seria bueno que pusieran tambien lo largo del pantalon. recomiendo ampliamente comprar de  este vendedor. . . . got these based on reviews. wasn\\'t disappointed - they work great - and they look so cute on my son\\'s little tushy :) the only negative is that leg openings on the 2t size are an inch or so too big (my son will be 2 next month) so, sometimes the pee falls out through the gap. but i can\\'t fault the pant for that as my son is on the lean side (definitely not a porky kid). i like that these are soft cotton and wash well. and, as another reviewer wrote - they can be used as underwear until they grow out of them - so you get your money\\'s worth. always a plus :) we have used these for over a month and after the first week he was already half-way potty trained (i say half-way because he pees in the potty, but won\\'t poop) - i really think these helped him make the connection because he feels the wetness. we use pampers easy ups for naptime and overnight - that way he still feels like he\\'s wearing \\\\\\\\\"big boy\\\\\\\\\" underwear instead of a diaper :) the pants are very comfortable. they go well with all kinds of snickers and especially great with vans slip-ons. they are also good with heels.<br /><br />the only problem i have with it is the waist size.too large. and i\\'m medium size.<br /><br />overall it\\'s perfect for the gym and even work if your workplace doesn\\'t have strict dress code. she luved them i can understand that other reviewers might think these pants fit oddly, but fortunately, with these pants, my son\\'s oddliness is well-served. he is 13 years old, and very thin. i know there are other parents with this problem of having a skinny kid, and everything that fits their waist is too short, or if the length is right, their ass can\\'t hold them up. the size extra small in these pants has a verrrry tiny waist and they are very long. it\\'s perfect for this body type. my son is crazy about these, and the ones with the skulls. i\\'ll be ordering more. fit was perfect.  material was comfortable and seemed to be well made for the price. i love the amanda style also but they can be a bit snug and uncomfortable around the waist. i wish i could find more of the sadie jeans. i was able to find a lot of the capris, but the jeans are hard to find. nice pants great price good stuff but they are a thin material. they take a few times washing to get real comfortable. good purchase comfy!! these pants are so soft and comfortable feeling, they are summer weight, therefore not too hot, when worn over all the other clothing very young babies wear.  they wash well (in cold water) and there does not appear to be any shrinkage. would certainly buy again . purchased as a gift, so just going off what i\\'ve seen.<br /><br />i guessed her right size and it looks to fit very well. it doesn\\'t appear to have shrunk. the cotton was a standard thickness, not really thin (but also not thick and hard to move in.) very flattering and comfortable i love them, they fit perfectly. an i got them on the exact day i was supposed to get it:) wow.  these are wide pants. the pants fit well but they are kind of short on me and i\\'m 5\\'5&#34;. other than the length, i like them i absolutely love these leggings! they are somewhat see through, but not enough to be worried about. very pleased these are the softest and most comfortable leggings i\\'ve ever worn. they fit perfectly and aren\\'t see-through like a lot of leggings. nice product. i just ordered wrong size. hassle free exchange for the right size. fits perfectly. great fit but a tad on the short side.  i\\'m using these for golf due to all the wonderful pockets!  the zippers at the ankle are cute, but be careful- i backed up to a dresser and the zipper cut my leg.  but they do look great! nice, light weight warm ups.  loose over the leg, so no gripping. very low rise, but wearable, love the color. yellow. tighter than expected, but the stretchey fabric feels fine these jeans do run a little small but they look and fit great. very flattering for curves and your rear. i bought 2 pairs of these (in different sizes,maybe medium and large,the print on the tags washed out so i\\'m not sure),years ago,directly from the dance distributors catalog. i still have them. they look like new and i get plenty of wear out of them. i also worked out in them and i would say that if you plan to do that,buy a roomy size or compensate by not stressing the middle seam(like if your exercises or activities involve spreading your feet wide apart...the smaller size i got developed a little split on the seam that was small and easy to sew back up). beyond that,they\\'re like summer weight sweat pants(in that they look like sweat pants but are very lightweight and comfortable in summer weather),they\\'re slippery so you can slip other pants or sweat pants over them if you\\'re going to the gym or just leaving the house and would rather be dressed in more street-type clothes while you\\'re doing shopping or whatever...i like these and got another pair recently from amazon. plus they\\'re black/black and stay that way(not double-dyed black but definitely as black as a black car is(what i mean is,because they\\'re rip-stop nylon,they don\\'t fade at all with normal washing). these are very comfortable and baggy. nice, light weight cool pant.  soft pink<br />perfect fit, fast shipping, no hassle i bought these for my daughter and she absolutely love them. definitely would by them again for her or anyone else. came on time! fit great and look nice onüòÑ very pleased with these pantsüòÑ wishe they had more colors to choose from. perfect for business atire with dress shirt yet casual enough to bend and lift if needed. very comfortable! perfect yoga pants i bought these boots for my daughter and they fit just as expected and she loves them very, very much! could this jeans fit 4\\'11 tall women? or is it tall in length? very nice and good fit these pant liners were just what i had been looking for and the price was perfect.  in the northeast they add a bit of warmth when worn with slacks or trousers which are not of a wool, and they are sleek enough to not add any bulk. when i first tried to put these on i almost gave up, but with some perseverance i was able to squeeze my 5\\'7&#34; 170lb self into them.  they actually stretch really well, but on me they are a little scandalous because they are so skin tight.  i do like the high waist, it kinda holds everything in.  they look really cute with a baggy sweater, but i\\'m probably not going to be rocking them with a crop top and heels (might go to jail lol). great. these have an amazingly flattering cut and fit (i have a bigger but and larger legs), but look great on my slimmer built friends as well. material is very soft and not see through, will definitely buy again and highly recommend. i am with liking pants very much today! thank you america! go bush! go obama! bad mubarak! bad qadafi! i love u s a very much! in pants my new wearing so sexy! hollywood! paris hilton! on friday i wear these pants very much to prayers at al nasir mosque!

todo bien  gracias llego  todo  en perfecto estado.<br />todo bien  gracias llego  todo  en perfecto estado<br />todo bien  gracias llego  todo  en perfecto estado nice fit fine but the fold over part is loose works as expected too cute for a little boy. i highly recommend this item for anyone that\\'s a falcons fan and ready for some football! i rarely order pants online.  these yoga pants fit amazing, the length is perfect and the material is very comfortable.  i am very pleased. it\\'s shorts weather here at least nine months of the year, and these pants are great for the kid\\'s school uniform.  they\\'re the right color, they\\'re durable, and i only had to buy five of these vs. five each of shorts and pants.  it would be great if the sizing was more standardized to kids clothing for older kids. i\\'m 5\\'11 1/2&#34; and 130 lbs and i got the small extra long. i don\\'t think i\\'ve ever owned yoga pants that truly fit before. they\\'re usually too wide or look like high waters which is not cool. these are great-i\\'ll be buying them in black too :) fits great & looks good! these pants were a nice color for a woman, but they do run a little large, but they said that they would, the pants was shipped and i got them earlier than expected! thank you amazon! i so love these..... so comfy and attractive... they fit great perfect for under my summer long dresses. light,comfortable, easy to put on. beautiful, good quality great pricem fit well and provide excellent protection for little ones who still have an accident or two or dont wipe enough. these are the perfect pants.....size is spot on and they are soooo comfortable.  i would definitely buy again.  try them! i also bought the shirt and black leather hat to make my halloween costume complete! i love these. &#60;3 perfect for chilling and being a mom! i just got these pants and they are great.  i bought them to sleep in and they are super comfy.  i wish they had the poppy color in small because i would buy it too.  probably going to buy more. would you like a roundhouse kick to the face with these bad boys? i don\\'t think so! impressed with product!  would buy again as looks great.  appreciated the gift they sent along with my order. these jogger pants are super cute and stylish. i ordered a size up after reading that they run a little small.  they fit more like leggings instead of baggy sweats but not real tight like leggings. they are just right.  i am just under 5\\'4&#34; and the length hit me perfectly. they are a style that you can dress up or down. the fabric is a cotton polyester blend and so soft and so comfortable. i absolutely love them.  be sure to follow the care instruction and hand wash them in cold water and hang dry. i purchased my pants at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. excellent price and quality. these are my favorite pants to lounge around in. i saw something just like it in target and said to myself, &#34;ooooh, what a concept!&#34; but i wanted a better price. this purchase did the trick. i liked the outfit but the outfit did not come in a petite size.  the medium size i purchased was a little tight an too long. i really like these lounge pants because they\\'re light weight and extremely comfortable. one note though.  be aware that the can appear virtually translucent if you are standing in front of a light source. this may actually be a plus for some people. as described perfect pants, worn daily almost, wash well, super comfy, fit a teeny tiny 00 to well into the 20\\'s --perfect pants. yoga- great. lounging- great. beach- wonderful. i\\'m in the middle- i wear a 10, these are fantastic. a beautiful set for lounging.  the fabric is so warm and comfortable,  i wish i could have kept it, but the sizes are so itsy bitty. oh welll, it was not meant to be... pants are great. life of the party on 4th of july for sure. great quality and great design. would like to maybe see some elastic bands by the ankles. i love my green gaucho pants so much that i also bought a black pair.  i wear them all the time!  very comfy & good quality!  they are dressy or casual depending what you wear them with.  they wash well too! bought this for my 13 week old son...nice and light material that feels good against his delicate skin. i just wish it had feet on it too!! would definitely recommend. these pants are very cute and holding up well. great quality and great price. they fit comfortable on my litte one.  i definitely will buy again. :):) fits good super cute capris, for my daughter who is 7 months pregnant, she normally is a size 8, so i ordered large so she will fit in them until delivery.  they was up nice in cold water and hang to dry. i already had a pair of these that i had purchased from a small store in crested butte, co.  i thought i had to wait to go back there for another pair, but luckily found them amazon.... love them!!  comfy, great fit, great for lounging and sleeping on cool/cold nights.  the hold up well with washings (although i don\\'t put them in the drier, so i can\\'t speak to that), and they hold their color well.  pleased overall. nice and comfortable, great pricing.  will order from vendor again. i really like the quality of this brand of workout pants--this is my second pair.  i bought these to spice up my workouts.  i have since discoverd that these are men\\'s pants--even though i still have a hard time visualizing any man i know  wearing these! i think they are wild so i still like them! they are comfortable--they run a little large for ladies and are long if you are less than 5\\'4\\\\\\\\\". these are wonderful pants! i get compliments on them every time i wear them. they are a little long, so i will need to get them hemmed. otherwise, perfect pants. good quality material, nice & thick, top doesn\\'t roll down during exercise (and i do crossfit!), and they are so attractive! i am planning to purchase more in other colors. these pants are really comfortable. i love dancing in these pants in my hip hop class. i recommend them if you like stretchy, baggy pants. thanks boyfriend loves them! i first ordered the medium and they were way too large for his 30\\'\\' waist... so i ordered the small and they fit him perfectly, showcasing the best parts of his anatomy that hours at the gym rewards you with. so, bonus for me, too :) it was ok wonderful! :-) these fit perfect. i am 5\\'9&#34; and was worried that they wouldn\\'t be long enough. they are way longer than i expected. i also thought they were going to be see through when i held them and felt the fabric, however they are not see through. the fabric feels silky and they are very comfortable while still looking cute. i definitely recommend these for taller girls. if you are on the shorter side, you will be swimming in these. nice fit, the length was perfect. great color. material and very comfortable. washes well. cargo pants look great on! i should have brought more than one pair. love them they are so cool and look so amazing on.  my daughtes 5\\'9&#34; they dont reach<br />her ankles more like calfs she wears them with boots.  got tons of compliment.  my other<br />daughter wore them with sneakers for hip hop class and  they looked equally amazing. great! fourstar it fits perfectly, lovely quality, lovely color; doesn\\'t fade away after a bunch of washes (i bought this like... a month ago), and it still looks at perfect as the day i got it &#60;3 as a mother and exercise fanatic, i am constantly looking for the yoga pant that is comfortable yet stylish. for the price, these were perfect, i love the fit of these yoga pants so great! i love these. they are so comfortable and inexpensive. finally found a pair of yoga pants that fit great, good quality material, hold up well in washings. i ordered a 2nd pair as i somehow spilled bleach on my other ones. i love the fact that these are long, i\\'m 5\\'10&#34; and these are roomy and comfy - they hold their shape, but aren\\'t too tight, i got the xl because i just had a baby so these are just extra comfy and look nice enough to wear out - running to the store - i\\'ve even wore them to work with a nice shirt. highly recommend! oh i love it because it\\'s really fit on me and most i love is the quality that cares for skin. it\\'s not heavy and not much stretchy too. overall it\\'s good skinny pants. ! they are nice and stylish to wear with some nice flatform sandals so cute it\\'s great professional construction in every detail. meets or exceeds our expectations in every way. my little girl loved these!  she originally ordered them to use as pajama bottoms, but now she wears them all the time. these wear great while i was on maternity clothes and postpartum. thank you! when i first opened these i thought for sure there was no way they were going to fit, because the elastic waistband looks tiny. but it is very stretchy and these are soooo comfortable. a little long for my short legs, but i\\'ll be living in these for the next several months. i bought three pair, i wish i\\'d bought more. i was surprised by the nice quality and cute detail on the pockets. i am 5\\' 2&#34; and 132 lb and the large fit me well but i need to hem up 5 inches. they wash well and hold their shape and size. i will buy more. i bought these cause they had cats all over them, i got them and they\\'re the cutest leggings in the world!! i\\'m in love with cats so i\\'ll defiantly wear these all the time c: i\\'ll defiantly buy more from this seller! ^¬§^ these pants fit true to size. there is a very comfortable elastic waist band. the material is somewhat thicker;i think these will run a little hot in the summertime, but they seem to have a nice surface which will resist dirt and they have some sheen to them.<br /><br />the cargo pockets on the side are good for storage, but there are just too many pockets overlapping, making the sides a little too thick for me. there is a regular pocket, then a zippered pocket and then more pouches for small things, all on top of each other on the cargo.<br /><br />the lower-leg-pockets are smaller and have a velcro strip inside to keep them closed.<br /><br />the rear butt pockets have tabs with buttons to close, so it\\'s nice to keep a wallet without fear of it falling out.<br /><br />overall, i am happy with the pants and especially the price, and i will be keeping them. these pants are very comfortable, well made, with billowing material. i really love the feel, and am happy with the purchase. this suit looks great and is very comfortable to wear. one big plus for me is that it doesn\\'t seem to wrinkle and i\\'ve been sitting most of the day.  i love the 150\\'s wool with silk. it has a rich appearance and very classy.  nicely tailored. these are very pretty and flattering to the figure. they are made for someone 7 feet tall, however, so expect to shorten them. they have no hem so perhaps they are meant to be hemmed by the customer, which is what i plan to do. these pants fit very well. i really like them. wonderful fabric, and i love the print. pants are super high quality and the customer service is unmatched!  love these pants!!!! they make my booty pop and are soooooo comfy!  love love love!! these capri\\'s run a little small but they are super cute. be careful when you wash them, and do not dry! grand i also bought size large. i\\'m keeping both pair. these feel great on.  they are a little too long. i hope they will shrink some.  i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; and will only be wearing these for workout; although these look nice enough you could probably get away with paying them  as dress pants. great quality pants & fast shipping.  thanks! my baby is pretty big for his age, but at ten months he is still a bit away from potty-training. still, because trying to diaper him is occasionally like trying to wrestle a bear cub, i ordered a couple of different kinds of training pants so that i can \\\\\\\\\"diaper\\\\\\\\\" him standing up.    these are the most absorbent of the brands i\\'ve tried. i can slip him into a pair of these training pants and a wool or fleece diaper cover and he\\'ll be good for an hour or so.     make no mistake; these aren\\'t diapers, so at the end of that time there are good odds he\\'ll be soaked (it doesn\\'t take much). but it\\'s good to know that when potty training begins in earnest, i\\'ll be able to count on these to save us from soaked sheets and rugs.    also, the times my kiddo has pooped in these faster than i can get him onto the potty chair, the leg and waist elastics have contained the mess. good stuff!  i\\'ll be ordering a size up soon. they are very thin but for the price are worth it. very comfortable tho! the fit is nice, but a bit snug.  however, these do stretch, and so it was okay after a few minutes of wear. i think these will be nice in the future, just too large for her right now.  i would buy again, just be aware of the sizing. pants are pretty and comfy, fit a little tight on the hips, perfect length and the fabric looks durable. not much to say about this: it fits nice, it looks nice, and it feels nice. and i love footie pants! these are so comfortable that i could wear them 24 hours a day.  i just got them and am thrilled with how they fit (i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; & 120 lbs, ordered a small).  i\\'m going to have to cut off about 8&#34; & hem them, but that\\'s not a big deal for me.  since they were only $16.50 i expect i\\'ll have to hand wash them so they\\'ll last. i was going to return this item because of the cost of it but as soon as i got it, i fell in love with these pants. no way am i returning them. this was a baby gift for a friend she said she likes it a lot. nice pants very cute but be aware it fit me a little tight and i am only 115lbs and 5\\' tall these are my favorite yoga pants ever.  i am 5\\'11&#34;, and a size 8 and the large fit me well.  they are very very long.  like a smidge too long on me and i have a 35&#34; inseam, so i really don\\'t think these would work for shorter ladies.  they are good for every day wear (hey, i\\'m a college student) and for exercise.  i have a few other pairs of pants from t party and i love them all.  over all definitely recommend. i love them they fit perfectly i would buy more they make u look like u have a nice shape these pants fit great and are long which is wonderful. sooo comfy i love them! but they are somewhat see through in the butt area, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. i don\\'t think i\\'d wear them out to yoga class but oh my god so comfy!! i bought these for my friend. unfortunately i tried them on first. they are so cute but i had already told her about ordering them for her. so i just told her that i had to wear them once first. she loves them too. they were called spandex in our day. lol the pants fit perfectly, are very comfortable, and i\\'ll wear them a lot, since they are lightweight and perfect for spring-into-summer. super cute good material little hard to button but other than that fit great the order on my zumba pants came on time and it fits perfect...can\\'t wait to start my first class on zumba...  i\\'m waiting for the second zumba pants to come in october and those head band and wrist bands..    getting exciting to lose the fat off of my stomach...\\\\\\\\\"( love these pants! they can be casual everyday or paired with a sweater for a dressier look for work :) i love these pants! they fit nice in the hips a little long though-i\\'m 5\\'4 and 26-27 waist. very cute my husband says they fit my curves. these were for my mother in law , and she seems to like them quite well.  she is in assist. living apartment and they all seem wear them!<br /><br />diane martin it is ok that it is too large though.  it is for spirit week and they are going to look fabulous!!!! good shopping kicky pants products are great!! they\\'re somewhat over-priced but i can tell they\\'re comfy. we have this in 2 colors now. these are adorable. he\\'s 17lbs and 27&#34;. these have plenty of room for bulky diapers and the leggings will fit him for a long time. i got 80\\'s. they will easily fit any baby 6m to 12 months. comfy, stretchy and so cute. love the pants, but there just too large. sent back for an exchange of a smaller size big!!!! very comfy and sooo cute!!! these are the best pair of pants i\\'ve ever bought.<br /><br />honestly so comfy and so unrealistically durable.  i skateboard and rockclimb in them.  fit like angels\\' hands all over my legs. beautiful fabric, so soft & silky. highly recommend for any infant! first pair of yoga pants. love them. these leggings are really cool! i ordered a medium but i probably should have gotten a large since they are sheer and they stretch a little unless you\\'re really skinny. but you can always wear opaque tights underneath them. overall, really cute and made well! fit like rxpected. light weight. not too hot or confining. usually sweats are too short and end up being floods after just a couple of washings.  these are awesome!  they\\'re long enough for me and my daughter.  we have longer legs than usual and it\\'s nice to be able to wear some cute sweats.  these don\\'t cut into our tummies and make us look like we have love handles.  it\\'s a smooth fit, making us look athletic.  the length is the biggest bonus for us, but the fit definitely wins us over too. these fit great and look so sexy.  i am 5\\'4\\\\\\\\\" and wear a zero.  i ordered the small.  they are not low rise fyi.  they are also lace completely in the front.  they look great under a dress or lond tunic. these pants are very comfy and cute for lounging about the house. material is soft and slinky. not sure i would wear them out and about, but very nice for hanging at home with friends or family.  just a note, i am 5 feet tall, and these hit me below the ankle so if you are tall, they would not work. love the pockets too.  i may just order another couple of pairs as they are priced quite reasonably. also, the seller packaged them very nicely - wrapped in tissue paper, etc. cant believe it this is real nice reminds me of an air jordan i had back in the day.....sooo happy...well worth it...i promise these yoga pants are very comfortable.  they feel snug without being tight; just like i like them.  i suspect it would be that way on anyone who typically wears this size because the fabric is a thicker stretchy material.  i\\'m 5\\'2\\', and the length looks very similar to the picture.  i haven\\'t washed them yet, so i don\\'t know if they\\'ll shrink.  i\\'m off to buy more. good product this really helped my 2 1/2 year old go potty.  she was potty trained in 4 days this is a fantastic product for cleaning wool garments.  washed wool sweaters and pants on my washing machine\\'s \\\\\\\\\"hand wash\\\\\\\\\" cycle making sure i followed manufacturer\\'s instructions.  the garments had a nice smell and cleaned up great.  there was a little shrinkage but did not affect the sizing.  steamed the garments after drying and they came back to the original shape. good! comfortable bought these pants for a friend who just had her first son. pants were bought big so baby has clothes to grow into. these are the second 3 pack of these pants i got him. the colors are perfect for a boy and the material is very soft. mommy likes the way the leg tapers for winter to keep his legs warm. i would recommend luvable friends products for anyone having a baby or as a gift. there are no tags to rub baby\\'s soft skin and they\\'re just an all around nice product. they have adorable onesies or as they call them bodysuits too. great work out pants and very flattering too!<br />high quality and great material and color!<br />i love working out in these pants! perfect as far as i know it was a hit; xmas gift for a family i work with that is going thru some trials. i used these as part of a costume. the material is a bit more stiff than i expected, but i think after washing a few times it will soften up nicely. great quality...and fits great! im very satisfied i got these as a gift.  they are extremely comfortable and super soft. the color is just as vibrant as in the picture as well. my only negative is that they shortened slightly after the first wash. i got this ones to be regular undies, since my baby is not on potty training anymore. i tried with different brands from walm..rt but they just ended in the garbage since they where awful, the ones that cover my daughters bum completely were very tight and uncomfortable, the ones that were comfortable were very lose on the areas that were important to cover; so i just went back to this ones that i have tried before and were happy with them.  they have very cool colors, they are soft, thick but not bulky, very very comfortable and they are affordable too.<br />thank u gerber! please bring more colors and designs.<br /><br />virginia<br />toronto, on. so cute, everyone asks where i got them.i like the design,the fit is perfect.im 5\\'7,130 pounds with wider hips..i ordered size med and it was perfect love these pj\\'s fit is perfect i got this for my sister she just had her baby and it fits the baby good. really comfortable i\\'m 5\\'6 a little long with flats but with a little higher heel are great. they fit a little large compared to major brands. i ordered 3-6 months and my baby boy is 6 months old and weighs 19 pounds. the way they fit is longer and more slender than many mass marketed baby pants like carter\\'s. i think this makes him look more grown-up, taller and less chubby! but they do fit him well, he isn\\'t a tall baby, they just make him look more that way. the fake pockets on the front also add a nice stylistic touch. these are a nice medium weight fabric, and i think they will hold up well in the wash. just what my grandaughter want for christmast.  she loved the fit, and the color. she does a lot of dance so these are the perfect pair of pants for this activity. i loved these! they are super cozy and cute! the quality is very nice and they are easy to get on and off. after 2 wearings there are tiny holes along the seam, not sure it that is a result of being tighter than expected or just bad stitching...? a very fashionable 3 piece active wear suit by cookie for a reasonable price.  i love it!  the material accents the shape of your curves.  very fashion forward and trending, please get at least one for yourself.... as a gift to someone else! excellent great yoga pants, soft and fit well. fits well üòÑüòÑüòÑ these look great!  i got these for my husband\\'s pirate outfit and i was worried about the fitted lower leg portion ( my husband has very large calves).  these actually worked out right (the only con is that the lacing for the lower part dug into his leg a bit but wasn\\'t unbearable) and we are very pleased.  good, fast shipping. good and recomended seller, as described, good deal, thank you well-made, durable material, strong seams, and stylish fit. one of my new favorites. material is a little tighter than expected and is thick and heavy. definitely too warm for summer wear for me. keeps moisture and harsh weather away from skin.  but,it feels like a compression garment w/in 2 hours and becomes really uncomfortable.  great for short term use, but for those who live in harsh weather and need to stay warm for 8 or more hours per day, be prepared for compression.  who needs spanks when you have this product? better then i expected , 100% mil-spec quality take it from a us navy veteran . i will be ordering more of this product in the near future. my family started a new tradition of opening pajamas on christmas eve, wearing them that night, and having them on while we open presents on christmas day. i was fully aware that would mean wearing a pair of unwashed pajamas for my 20-month old and the idea of that almost made me cringe, as they soak even baby clothing in the most horrid chemicals you can think of.<br />i adore this brand because it is free of formaldehyde, they use no chlorine, low impact dyes, free of nasty flame retardants, ect. i absolute love this brand anyway because the bamboo plantations are also pesticide and fertilizer free, it\\'s a responsible company to buy from.<br /><br />aside from all the safety stuff, these pajamas are so soft! i could not stop squeezing my little boy! it\\'s so light and movable, perfect for a kid on the run, but cozy enough to fall right to sleep in. he is at his \\\\\\\\\"tall/lean\\\\\\\\\" stage currently and i bought him the 18-24 months, they fit perfectly. we have bought kicky pants in the past and they aren\\'t bulky like other clothing, they will stretch to fit, which i love. i would highly recommend these! i purchased the 0-3 months for my newborn. they fit him perfectly. he weighed 8 lbs. 6 oz. the pants are soft and match the onesies i bought for him too. it\\'s hard to find this color of green. good sizing love these pants the fit is great!! it fits a bit tight.  hopefully it doesn\\'t shrink in the washer.  i am 5\\'9&#34; and weigh 155. the bra should be bigger great quality and super cute i\\'m more than certain i\\'m going to order a pair in every size - i\\'m in the process of loosing weight - and they\\'re flexible with whatever size i\\'m heading into. love love love them! the lounge pants are comfy, roomy cotton, not too heavy, and perfect for lounging around in socks watching big bang theory, or sleeping. i ordered a set of red pants and matching top for myself and another set in blue for my husband, and we both love them. they appear to be well-made, of a nice cotton fabric, and the design is great. the waist has a drawstring, so it\\'s easy to adjust for a comfortable fit. the length is a long for little me, but that doesn\\'t bother me, and i may get around to hemming them after a few washes.<br />if you\\'re big bang fans, you\\'ll love them. it would have been great but it was too big. so i returned it for a refund and ordered the 40 which fit just fine.thanks to andrew and all the gang. these are comfortable and fit nicely. they are soft also. delivered quickly. these pants fit well, look good, and are comfortable. there is a funny thing, though, i wear them when i walk on the beach. if the waves hit my legs or feet the hem fills with sand. it winds up looking like i\\'m wearing a miniature sandbag around my ankles. these pants are great.  they fit good and look good and i highly recommend them if you are into the goth and industrial scene. i have these in both the brown and olive colors.  i wore these mainly as capris.  being a tall person (5\\'8) i couldn\\'t wear them as regular pants because the inseam was too short.  luckily i was mainly pregnant during the spring and summer time so it didn\\'t really bug me that i couldn\\'t wear them as pants.  they really aren\\'t worth the $40 i paid for them especially when i found some awesome capris at target for half price, but i guess that is what you get when you pay for a certain brand. love the material and fits great! fit well for the most part. jacket was just a tad bit short but overall great buy for the money. i was very pleased with the quality of the slacks received.  i have shopped at joseph a banks before but it didn\\'t dawn on me to check their web site for these items.  the quality was as promised and the items were received as promised.  definitely 5 stars! i bought these in a size large black to have to wear as pajama pants after an upcoming abdominal surgery, because i am going to need something loose and comfortable.  i have worn them and love them.  they did not shrink much, if at all,  and the sizes run big.  i bought a size large and probably could have used a medium and i like my pj pants baggy. so keep that in mind when you purchase. i love this item because it is so soft and looks so comfortable.  i have a few other items by this brand and love them as well. these are cute but lightweight and they run small. i bought these for my brother, but he gave them to his daughter! amazing just a little big, but love the material had to send them back and exchange for a smaller size. still waiting to get them but loved them. so cute!  they fit perfectly! all good if you purchased this product hoping it\\'s pee proof,it\\'s not. that would warrant 5 stars.i am very happy with this product,and have used for several years,for a special needs child.these are a great compliment to disposable pull-ups,as an outter cover.i have searched high and low for something to fit a youth,i guess most manufacturers assume only babies wet the bed. i always get a bigger size, knowing they are going over a pull-up type pant. with these i\\'m not washing sheets everyday. great product! so refering to my title, this legging is great for a night out with a short top or dress. i was worried it was high waisted like other similar leggings on amazon but it sat below my belly button. i wore it to a club, worrying i might get too hot or it would scrunch up since i\\'m fairly short -5\\'2\\\\\\\\\"- but i had no issues with it whatsoever. i got complements on it (it looks expensive) and my boyfriend loves how my butt looks in it! great investment. glad i bought this. perfect, size is correct and looks like picture, i am in love with these pants, very nice fitting!!i would recommend these top us ladies my husband bought the pants for me as a last christmas present. i loved it so much, so i bought three different colored pants by myself :) i chose s size. i\\'m 5 feet tall, so i needed to cut about 2 inch of the bottom. that\\'s not such a pain, because i love sewing.<br />the pants is comfortable, and make my legs look thinner and longer! the fit is soooo comfortable and the fabric is great.  they are stretch so i could have ordered a size smaller....matter of fact, i think i will.  in all colors!!!  highly recommend. i love these jeans!!! they don\\'t necessarily make my butt look bigger, but they sure do make my butt look really nice! :) perfect for travel and very comfortable. i have three pairs of these in different colors and love them!! quick shipping, quality product, and great price! there weren\\'t any stains or cosmetic issues that i\\'ve heard were common, so that was great too! this is my first pair of yoga pants bought from amazon, and they fit amazing!! they\\'re a little long at the bottom but i personally think the more length the better since i am tall (not too long) and fit me great! will definitely be purchasing more :) extremely comfortable,feels like i\\'m not wearing anything! new favorite piece of clothing. very stretchy and soft material ; foldable band makes anyone feel slimmer. seriously considering ordering more. i\\'m 5\\'7 and 130 lbs, and the small fit me like a glove love the colors they are perfect for fall in florida because they are light  and comfortable. fits comfortably although they seem to stretch a little faster then most pants like this. very soft and fits true to size. a big baggier than expected but great fabric and design. love the teez her skinny pants.  feel great on, washes  and dry well.  does not wrinkle!<br />they do collect lint, hair, etc. but most black pants do.<br />look good going out, or feels good lazying around the house. comfy for baby the pants are exactly what i wanted.  they are cute, comfortable, and warm.  they are also well made and soft.  these are great for hanging around the house while not looking like a total slob. m daughter has short legs so this fit perfectly, would not recommend for babies with long legs but it\\'s warm and very cute! these fit perfectly and are a great addition to my wardrobe.  the are comfortable and wash well.  they look great for a night on the town! i like them alot, very comfortable. makes me feel good in them while working out! i was worried because the product was cotton, but it fit nicely, very full loads of material i am 5\\' 2&#34;  125 lbs it fits me perfectly and i will be wearing my five inch platforms i chose red and it looks just great...can\\'t say enought about this romper this is my fourth one, and i love them all get loads of compliments and lots of heads turning when i wear them...five stars these capris were made for guard girls without any booty... i ordered my normal size of pants and they fit everywhere but there. also, the words down the right leg aren\\'t on the front as pictured, but they are directly on the side and the bottom of the leg gets scrunched up so they are difficult to read at first glance. otherwise they are very comfy for practice or sleeping in or anything, i just have to keep them pulled up! not amazing, but decent scrubs that get the job done. pockets are useful and in the right locations. you can use these long term but they aren\\'t as comfortable as the higher quality ones. if you need a temporary or occasional set then these are for you. i love them so much! they fit as i expected them to and they\\'re so comfortable. i definitely recommend these great cloth diaper pants. very nice these are so comfortable! they feel like a legging but look somewhat like a jean. i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; 120 lbs. i ordered a medium and they fit well, but too long. i roll them up and they look perfectly fine. these pants look just like the picture. they are really comfortable and nice quality. its always hit or miss with yoga pants being too thin, these ones are not super thin. i love training pants! i have bought them for my son (these ones)  and also a pink set for my daughter. as soon as we did the switch with my daughter she caught on fast! my son...... 6 mo latter and we are still working on it :(  but i have told may parents what i did with my daughter and many friends have had the same results. the little ones don\\'t like to be wet and these pants teach them that when you need to go you asap. and if your little one pees a little, there pants will not be all wet and embrace them. longer than expected. love these pants. the most comfortable thing i can wear outside of the house. i\\'ve even worn them to work on casual friday. they are just a little too long for me (i wear short length usually) and would probably be too short for someone with long legs. love them soft, have stretch. they are  ery warm and fit well. definitely for cold weather. recommend for anyone wanting soft pj or  lounge pants! oh and yes the drawstring at the waist also works. look real hot and they stay where you wear them. they hold their shape after a couple hours of stretching and bending during wear. have not had a chance to see how many washes they will handle without loosing their stretch. these fit me perfectly! i love them! stop reading my review and buy them. not what i was expected very disappoint it we purchaced these pants for my 3 year old son who just seem to not have any success with pull-ups.they worked great.he was broken within a week.the really seem to help our son. i have gotten sooooo many compliments on these pants.  not to mention questions like &#34;where did you get those from&#34;? and &#34;how much were they?&#34;. i\\'m a trendy female 38 years young from maryland and i do not like to look like everyone else!! the one size fits all was fine for me with still a little room around the waist and i\\'m 5&#34;6 170 pounds curvy and they still fell baggy on me! my son lives in these things whenever possible!  very comfortable. don\\'t buy yellow unless you look great in yellow. this color is kind of see through, but soo comfy and soft. they run small. i\\'m normally a medium and i got a large. fit all heights well! and made my butt look good. great cut and fabric. thank you nautica. i am 6\\'5\\\\\\\\\" and these pants are great fit especially with long rise. i always get one size longer and have it custom fit at the tailor to my height. i don\\'t know how it fit because it was a gift. excellent wallflowers are the best , they look great, they hold there  shape after being washed, many others do not!!, and they are comfy. i will continue to buy them. i am a bellydance student and was happy to find these pants.  these are<br />great for the price.  i am 37 1/2 hips and 29 waist 5\\'4 tall.  if i was<br />any wider they would be to tight but fit me perfect.  feels like they<br />will be comforable to work out in (stretchy). these pants are very comfortable but somewhat snug for an xl.  the drawstring waist is great and length is good. i love the style and material but was too small. i ended up giving them to my 12 yr old they fit her perfect oh my god they\\'re the most comfortable pants i\\'ve ever wore! they were a little big but he loved them they wre too long like the pants and the colors.  great fit and very comfortable. wow, are these awesome.  it\\'s hard to find the suspender pants, but these are the best. i love them! be sure to get yours! i actually ordered the black/charcoal pants, but received the charcoal/black pants instead. no biggie; i\\'m not going to leave the house in these pants. i don\\'t know about the black pants, but the charcoal pants are slightly sheer. you can see the white tag on your butt, and i could see my charcoal underwear through the charcoal pants. other than that- they are very comfortable. i\\'m 5\\', so they are very long on me, but they easily roll up. another reviewer mentioned that these don\\'t produce a camel toe, and while that\\'s true- there\\'s actually a seam that runs right up the front and makes a perceived one. but again, maybe it\\'s because mine are gray and the seams are more visible. perfect... little long but i\\'m short. 5\\'4. i will take them to be hemmed. not sheer. so i can wear these to work. these are the perfect pants. stretchy but not clingy. i wore mine a lot through my last pregnancy and am on my second pregnancy in them. also good for after the baby. they are great to wear to work and a little sexy to boot - which we all need right about now! they are listed as jersey but are not the gross shiny kind, very matte and feel like rayon. 5 stars because it\\'s effective, but i hated sweating this much. it works! my husband needed emt pants and these fit well. he\\'s a 33x36 in blue jeans and ordered a medium-long. pants were slightly longer than expected. so be aware of that. but i was happy that they weren\\'t too short! i love them! they are so comfy and light! i want another pair in a different color next time! 5 stars! tigerstripe is the name of a group of camouflage patterns developed for close-range use in dense jungle during jungle warfare by the south vietnamese armed forces/us forces. it derives its name from its resemblance to a tiger\\'s stripes.<br /><br />when most people look at tiger stripe they think vietnam, usually seals, sog, sof and the like, and they would be right. this isn\\'t the most effective camo pattern out there. in fact intimidation and fear was one of the reasons it was selected for, not its ability to blend ninja like into the jungle. but it is effective enough for most uses.<br /><br />tigerstripe was never an official us-issue item. personnel permitted to wear it at first had their camo fatigues custom-made by local tailors, arvn uniforms being too small for most americans; for this reason there were many variations of the basic tigerstripe pattern. from 1969 5th special forces group contracted with vietnamese producers to make fatigues and other items such as boonie hats using arvn fabric.<br /><br />i\\'ve used the pants for several tactical rifle classes i\\'ve attended and then some general hiking and workout use and like all propper pants they hold up well with no issues. the shrinking after a hot wash and dry was minimal and the medium long versions fit me perfectly, just like the military issue pant sizes. i bought these for my daughter and she loves them. they are soft and comfy. gift to my brother, stated\\' heavy duty winter like material&#34; seams reinforced. great quality. he stated&#34; has bought others., best so far and very satisfied with quality. nice quality.  the sides tend to stretch out a bit. overall, it\\'s great to find a company that offers products for the taller than average toddlers.<br />thanks! these rock!!!!  you will be soooooooooo happy if you buy these!  they are amazing!!!  the soft fleece, inside is so cozy!!!  i got these just before we went winter camping in a cabin that was 10 degrees when we arrived and these stayed on pretty much the entire trip.  (the stove sucked and it never got above 60 degrees, but i stay nice and warm in these)  best purchase of my life!  would highly recommend, wonderful product, reliable seller, super fast delivery!!! my son loves them.<br />cute great look. there pants and have a great style. love there line of clothes. however if you are bigger than a size 10 they will not fit. highly recommend if you like unique. love these! finaly found something that fits perfectly..i\\'m 7 months pregnant (168lb)  and those pants will fit for the next 2 months..strechy, color just like in the picture. will def. order another color. great! would order again:) for that price the frogg toggs raining pant is good. nothing fancy for downtown but for nasty weather when you are in the woods it best you can have. looking great! these palazzo pants are even nicer than i\\'d expected! they fit perfectly - i\\'m 5\\'2&#34;, and usually wear a size 8-10, ordered a medium. they\\'re a tiny bit long for flats (real flats, like flip flops) but with the high/low waist, they work well with both low heels and higher heels. the fabric hangs perfectly, and flows very well, for a great look.the material is thin and light enough for our southern summer, but not see-thru at all. as others have said, they really and truly are wrinkle free, even when folded or bunched! i am 5 ft 8 in tall and 230 lbs. not a perfect fit for me but i expected them to fit as such. i am very hippy with 19 in calves. with a little pull an tug to get them over my calves they\\'re fine. great price too. i will be ordering the shorts as well. they definitely do their job. good stuff great fit except the length. a little on the short side :-(( the material is very comfortable. these are stretchy and comfy, i love these pajama pants and wear them practically everyday. they fit as i expected them too, as they are guys pants they hang on my hips but i\\'ve never had a problem with them falling. looks good fit good un-hemmed good product. much larger than expected. these pants r adorable.... im a curvy girl, with a little extra in the rear-end area... very sexy for my shape. there\\'s little bit of give to them- so they r easy to wiggle into. pretty true to size :) im going to order a differnent color!!! i just purchased these pjs and they are the best soft comfortable and warm pjs ever. they fit perfect i love them so much they will most likely be my favorites i am coming back to purchase more hope they have different colors. love them will recommend to all family and friends. perfect for the winter!!! thank you angelina. bought as a gift for my husband.  he loves it! love! was looking all over for tall pants. these didn\\'t have a review but i took a chance. ordered the small  and when i got them i thought \\'oh, no - these will not fit\\'. i thought they were too small but actually  they fit perfectly. i would go down a size. i am planning to loose weight after having a baby and although  i am usually a medium in regular clothes, i fit perfectly in the small. shapes my butt and thighs a bit,  no cellulite in sight. love these pants and will order one more! so worth the price! excellent quality! pros:<br />patriotic as hell<br />super comfy<br />great for parties<br /><br />cons:<br />thin material<br />stain easily<br />color starts to fade a little after first wash<br />a little pricy<br /><br />overall, great pants. first off, i just love camo so having a womens pair and also in violet purple with the pretty greys with that black was really cute. i love all the pockets as well. my girlfriends have commented me while wearing them as well :)  the only thing i really wish i could change was that the waist wasnt so high up!- but i just fold them down and wore a lose top.<br />thank you! i love this product my uncle who lives in vermont also lives in cargo pants.  during the winter season, he wears the fleece-lined ones and the other seasons, the regular cargo pants. okay so let me start by saying when you order pants on the web, you really dont know what you will get.  so these pants were very, very nice i must say.  if you are like me and are kind of lazy and dont want to keep unzipping and zipping pants up, this is a better option because these pants just glided on so, nicely.  i love the fit and it actually made me look more shapely.  now, i\\'m not saying that there is any squeeze to them to make that effect.  all im trying to say is these pants gave me the hint of look that i was after.  so depending on what you are looking for whether its ease of wear or comfort, than its a go.  just make sure you are honest with yourself when it comes to the size, so look at the size chart and if you are not sure, than measure yourself with a cloth measuring tape, do this and you will be happy. great product, very warm! i am a medium in women\\'s so i bought the xl and they fit me very well but i do not like them skin tight.<br />they are a very nice breathable fabric which is perfect for summer wear which is unusual for jeggings.<br />they have a workable zipper, button and back pockets and look like real jeans.<br />i would highly recommend these to anyone looking for a comfortable jean! we purchased a pair while on vacation in new york from a store in little italy. we washed them once and they shrunk and so did my daughters heart. i finally found them online and she was excited to have a new, better pair. thank you!! excellent these pants are very comfortable, and although a bit thinner than i expected, they are great! well worth the money! i\\'ve always loved woodland camo and i needed to replace a pair of hunting pants, so this looked like it would be a good fit.       buy with confidence. i know these will serve me for many years to come.   i like they come in tall as i am well over 6-foot and need the extra length.    minor complaint- one of my belt loops was broken off upon receipt.  i do not believe this is typical of propper gear, but made me rate it 4 starts instead of 5. i love the pants a lot! they fit almost perfectly, i will be ordering more of this product :) :) :) :) :) these are by far the most comfortable pants i own. i wish i could buy 7 pairs and wear them every day of the week, that is literally how much i love them. unfortunately there was only two left in my size! i\\'m 5\\'8 135lbs and the size large fit perfectly. the waist has a bit of room, so i\\'m considering trying the size medium, cuz i seriously want more of these pants. they fit great, thanks for the deal. their great i bought these for myself- wasn\\'t sure how they would be- if you would be able to see through them a little like some others since they do say tights and others i have bought from differant people are really see through- but these leggings are great. the quality of the leggings is really good- just like the picture. love them, and can\\'t wait to wear. company shipped the pants really fast. they are nice quality and are not too thick or too thin. i really like the pull cord on the bottom of each leg which helps from stepping on the pants when i am walking around the house without shoes. i would buy another pair if they came in other colors. i bought these because i have a similar pair, but they were capezio. however, they didn\\'t have any in my size, so i purchased these instead. these are very soft, and fit well, but they are also very thin. a little long but comfortable. however, i had originally thought the pants were blue, but only the fold over waistband was. so pay close attention to the description to be sure you are getting the color you want. they\\'re a little see-through, so make sure you wear nude undergarments and something long.  i love these damn things.  i purchased the red cosmic pattern, but might go back and get some different prints. nice hanging around pair of pants.  cute and hugs your body in the right spots.  love it! love them!! i own a computer repair business, and have decided these are going to be part of the uniform!<br />dressy, but still have cargo pockets!<br />how can you go wrong?!<br />and, they arrived super quick! my wife was looking for some comfy pants to wear around the house and i was looking for some pants that made my wife tush look even better than it already did! well i found that perfect balance in these pants. she loves them and her tush looks amazing! very happy with the pants i have already ordered some more of these pants for christmas gifts for my daughters and sisters and additional ones for myself.  excellent fit and extremely comfortable. as it was introduce in the vietman era ann was used until 1987 is very good to wear it, very very cute leggings. just a little small. i can still fit in them and i am 150 lbs, but it\\'s cuttin it close haha. still very cute though. fit like a medium. kinda tight, and very lightweight knit... stretch too much and it becomes less opaque. the shipping was really fast considering they had to come form china, i got them in a little less than two weeks. they fit really well, the material is really smooth and i got loads of compliments on them when i wore them. they do look like the more expensive brand that these are a copy of and the print is just a little blurry but only when you\\'re looking at them up close. like, when you\\'re wearing them and really look at them but it\\'s not anything that would prevent them from being wearable. they do use white thread so the seam is visible when you\\'re looking at them from behind but that didn\\'t bother me at all. you get what you pay for, so these aren\\'t the nicest fabric ever. but for under $15, these are really comfy. mine got taken from the laundry room so i\\'m ordering more. another perk of the cheap price. although they were a little small ( i ordered large ) they worked out great slim fit initially, i was sad because of how these made my rear look....flat. also, they are quite plastic-y so i felt that they came off as costume-ish.<br /><br />the next time that i tried them on, i was more receptive and tried them with different underwear (a thong-no lace). much better than before and they kept me warm making for a great outfit with my short crop top for the club. they camouflage any issues that you may have with a bloated belly and they were a great length for they gather just a little above my shoes just like i like. the waistband is quite wide and it come up past my belly button, so it doesn\\'t interfere with my belly button ring.<br /><br />i like them.<br /><br />also, i washed them inside out in my regular dark load with warm water and all of the soap/softner products but inside of a delicate mesh bag. i hung them dry and then accidentally added them to the dryer for 20 minutes. they\\'re fine still but i still suggest hang drying them to prolong their quality. love them!!! very cute! my 4yr old granddaughter loved them! these jegging/leggings are made of double knit fabric that is 80% polyester, 15% rayon and 5% spandex. they have real pockets and a front zipper. they are designed to look like jeans, but they aren\\'t denim. they\\'re very soft and comfy. they don\\'t dig into the skin, and the fit is very smooth feeling and looking. the only draw back for me is, they are very low rise at the front. the waist is about 2 inches down from my belly button, and for me, that makes it a little uncomfortable. i am not a young hen and i have grown children and some  left over belly from my baby birthing days. it\\'s not disgusting, but i know it\\'s there. however, i plan to wear cute tunic tops with them. i bought them in  pink and yellow . the colors are beautiful. what a comfy feel on my hard and throbbing cock. cant wait to wear them to the mall!!!!!! great fit loved them just ordered more! this is a very heavy military belt i started wearing in the military. i have purchased 2 now and they work great. i am running my own farm now and in the summer i lose weight and in the winter i gain weight. the belt has a good velcro closer that is infinitely adjustable.<br /><br />fast ship pig too don\\'t expect it can be a daily wear, the material is super wired. however, considering th price and the quality, it is good enough for holloween. the softest and nicest lounge pants i have seen. they say they will shrink when washed, but i washed them in cold and hung them to dry...perfect. no shrinkage for me. it is a bit large but that is good for a growing toddler.  high quality of material in cotton, thick and very soft, very durable. this fits perfectly i have this in black hot this one for my mom shipping was fast is very nice, the material is a littler different from the other ones i had ordered.<br />but it\\'s fine. love the print and the softness of the cotton. a good buy. they\\'re a little tight but really flattering and soft! these pants feel great!  due to the fold over waist you can adjust the length so not to get camel toe. lol<br />you do have to shorten them and there is no hem.  it was a bit of a pain but worth the effort. these are good quality pants that look nice...good fit although it does help if you are average or more height to get the cropped pant effect. im happy with them, good price and fast shipping! exactly what i was looking for. comfortable and breathable, fashionable and feels great on a bike saddle. the crotch and upper legs stretch just how they should, biking is a lot more comfortable. the 511 were super skinny, these fit like regular jeans should. a nice touch, when you role up the pant legs there are reflectors on the inside. fits and washes well,fit s well  holds up well to daily work us would buy again. use for 4 days of work these pants are made of wonderful material that breathes, flows and looks great while you\\'re dancing.  they are ultra comfortable and i strongly recommend them.  that being said, i wear a size 7 in jeans and if these pants were any smaller i would be having troubles in the muffin top department.  these pants do not have a whole lot of stretch to the top of them, so if you have hips this may be a pass. warm, incredibly soft, zombie-proof! i wore this for a 10 k obstacle filled zombie run and they were fantastic! kept me warm, until i ran through the water, and hid me from encroaching zombies. highly recommend! this pair of trousers is very beautiful, fabric! kickee pants are one of my favorite brands. my little guy loves them! the material is unbelievably soft. i love my leggings that i purchased. the material is exactly what was described. i would purchase several more from this company. i absolutely adore these pants! for my 5\\'5&#34;,138 pound frame, my big butt and thighs make it hard for me to fit into a lot of jeans/pants. however, these could not fit me any more perfectly. the length just barely grazes the ground but isn\\'t quite long enough for me to step on them. they are very flattering to my curves but still professional. i bought them to wear for waitressing, and they will be absolutely perfect. and as far as &#34;shininess&#34;, as some other reviewers mentioned, there was absolutely none. i\\'ll probably wear them outside of work as well! these contain close to that of a diaper.  i recommend them around 1.5-2 years old for potty training.  i used gdiapers prior to these and both of my boys were night trained before being day trained. i was satisfied. i had to go up a size cause the xl was too short and i\\'m tall. love these pants. i\\'m 5 foot nothing so they are a little long on me but very comfortable. they fit perfect, i will be ordering them in more colors. these are amazingly comfy - the plaid fabric is surprisingly soft and similar to a flannel fabric. love it!<br />also love that the bottom of the legs can be removed - but if you\\'re familiar with tripp pants, this shouldn\\'t be surprising. the only complaint i could make is that the zipper in the knees can be uncomfortable when they\\'re zipped off to be shorts - though i wore them most of the time as shorts (as the legs are long enough on me to drag on the ground if they\\'re not tied up (i am really short)). good product. i have been looking for something like these for a long time and could never find an affordable pair. these are comfy, look great and didn\\'t break the bank! thank you! i love these pants. they fit perfectly, and are super comfortable. i would definitely recommend them, although bear in mind the material is a bit thin. more my fault then theirs, i ordered an extra large since i have a 34&#34; waist and they wound up being too lose in the waist and sliding down a tad. again, my fault since in hindsight i should have ordered simply a large. great product overall! really completed my hulk hogan costume. highly recommended! it\\'s a very light linen-type fabric and feels awesome in the summer. i\\'m 5\\'7 and the large hit mid-calf for me when pulled up to my chest. looks great either as pictured or with the elastic portion around the waist. i just don\\'t have the figure to wear anything like that. :( my granddaughter\\'s birthday is coming soon, and she will flip over the denims. i really love this pair of pants that i purchase the only problem i had was the length of these pants was a little too long so i had them shorten well made & well fit. since it\\'s colorful , you can have any color tops to match  it. the size small legging fits size 5-7 ( waist 28 butt 35, 5\\'5) my xl fit me perfect. i really like these grandma pj pants! they are lightweight but are of a plush fleece so are warm which makes them extremely comfy cozy in the colder months. i like the vivid colors and unusual patterns, i am so sick of the typical pastels used in kids clothing, and i don\\'t want to wear anything with the latest teeny bopper idol on them. young or old no matter the gender the items made by grandma rachel  would be snuggly to wear. is too big for me for large. the fit and the feel are awesome. i did find that the pants are quite long, however, and i will have to get them hemmed. but they were great in class too. i bought large size and being 5\\'7&#34; found that the product was a bit long for me.  it\\'s length is around 32 and i wear 30. as far as the workmanship goes, these pants are well constructed. the fleece liner make them very warm. numerous pockets - quite functional. they should be worn with snow boots. i deducted a star for standard sizing. otherwise it has my vote with no reservations. super cute yoga pants!<br />the fabric is thick and high quality.  not see through!<br />my only gripe is that it is about 2 - 3 inches too long. but i am only 5ft tall, so i expected to do some hemming. these were bought as pajama pants, and for that purpose, these are great. the material is thin, but i was expecting that for the price. very comfortable material. a little to thin to wear out of the house as it will show a panty line. i\\'ve used these to potty train all three of my kids.  when paired with the plastic covers, they are virtually leakproof.  the cloth helps them feel wet and provide them with negative feedback when they have an accident.  these are much easier to clean than the all-in-one training pants which often don\\'t come completely clean after messy accidents.  they hold up to repeated hot-water washing and are soft and comfortable.  the plastic pants don\\'t last as long and need to be washed carefully and air dried. can\\'t complain fits well enough for my nursing classes... can move around fine not too big not too small the material is a nice quality. no cellulite see- through. slims nicely. i\\'m 180 lbs, 5\\'9&#34; and wear a size 8 generally. they are just long enough. i could wear 3&#34; heels, but not higher. these are not pants for a professional setting, but i really like them and think they would be great for travel. and a travel wardrobe. they do not land high on my waist. they land 1 1/2 &#34; below my belly button. please make talls!!! good product. love i love these pants. my only complaint would be they are very long‚Ä¶i step on the ends, but i bought them for around the house so its not a big deal. they are thinner than yoga pants in my opinion and very stretchy. i like them a lot and wear them often around the house. i am really happy with these. they fit well and don\\'t ride up or shift around during pilates. i am 5\\'4, and currently 140 lbs at 6 months pregnant, and the small is fitting great. i\\'m very happy with my pants. i wear them regularly because they are so comfortable. i can dress them up by putting on some high heels & a cute blouse or i can dress my comfy pants down by putting on some sneakers & a cute tank top. i love my pants! i am very happy with this purchase. the material is nice and thick. fits awesome! great to throw on to make an outfit cuter than just yoga pants! i have finally found them!! these pants are just great for the smaller waist, big rear woman! i found that i can feel comfortable,look great, and feel like if i am wearing some nice non frumpy looking pants for a change. what a great pair of pants, please make them in other colors, i order on the net!!!thanks mossimo!!! i bought these pants while still pregnant with my little girl. they fit perfectly after she was born, and i paired it with all her tops. the variation in colors made it easy to match them with just about all her blouses.<br /><br />the elasticized ankle band creates a cute flow at the bottom and allows room for her to move around freely. they wash well because my second child also wore them...go figure. three in a pack!!?? what a deal, i mean, a steal :-) every mom needs these. very nice, although the color isn\\'t a true black. good product fit true to size.  little extra padding help for quick mistakes/misses finally i can combine my love for patriotism and working out. when i wear these amazing pants, i know that i\\'m showing everybody at the gym that these colors don\\'t run...except when i\\'m on the treadmill. love these! fits perfect! so cute and comfy! these are so cute! right length and very comfortable very comfy! i love them, will buy another pair for sure i ordered the charcoal colored ones and saw they were the black and grey in the package, but i\\'m not too picky and will accept anyway since all i own is black haha. besides that, they\\'re super comfy and fit perfectly, so i won\\'t complain üòè they were a gift but were delivered on time and they just love them. i actually really like these! the fabric is soft like pajamas but they look like leggings. it didn\\'t take too long to ship either. they have a small hole near the crotch but it\\'s hardly noticeable. love them! fits good, washes well & good price. okay, i am obsessed with harry potter, and even though i am a girl, and these are for men, i still wear these. oh my goodness, they are so comfortable, but a bit baggy on me. i don\\'t care, i still love them! i wish they had a smaller size, like an xs, perhaps? i bought these pants for my daughter. they are so soft and comfortable. i used them primarily as bedtime clothes so she doesn\\'t get hot. absolutely love the i these slacks are well made.  unfortunately,my weight has been fluctuating and these slacks fit the bill.  they are very comfortable and the side elastic accommodates my situation perfectly.  highly recommend. stonewash is neat, though these are smaller and shorter than the other t party yoga pants i have.  i\\'ve been spoiled by the fit of those. love these pants. i\\'m 5\\'11 and these pants were long enough for me. i bought this as an afterprom outfit and it was perfect! came on time, fit right and was just the best! i loved the look of the pants that go over the skate, so i thought i would try these out. i got an all black pair, and i am in love! i don\\'t even take them off when i get home from the rink. they are super comfortable. they are a little thicker than regular cotton leggings, but not so thick that i will be miserable in a 100+ degree summer when i\\'m trying to hurry from my car to the rink. the fit is fantastic, although i found the sizing chart they give to be a little small on the measurements. i went by my waist measurement only, and they fit great. i will definitely buy some more of these pants. i bought these for my daughter, she loved them!  they fit well all the way around! they\\'re so comfortable and soft. i have to tell myself over and over \\\\\\\\\"you can\\'t wear these again, you just wore them the other day\\\\\\\\\". ha i love them. i bought a size bigger so i get that baggy fit. this was a great buy. love these floral shorts because they are so unique.  the shorts fit as expected and the fabrics are good material. great for baby pajamas! easy to check or change diaper in the middle of the night. i want to buy 6 more for each night of the week. great color, great fit . i hope they have other colors i will buy them for sure. easy wash, gentle cycle. really like them! i really like this pair of baggy harem black pants from ellazhu. i bought it many months ago, and wanted to purchase a second pair recently. it seems it\\'s not available now. you can dress it up, or wear it casually. decent material for the price. these pants made my day when i got them. the colors are a bit brighter than shown in the picture, which is a plus. i ordered a small and the waistband is very stretchy and the pants fit good, even though i am normally a medium size. love \\'em! would live in these if i could!<br />(during the colder months)<br /><br />lost a star for stitching quality. no real complaints here. i ordered a medium long because i\\'m 6 feet tall and they were indeed long and had to be hemmed, but i prefer that to getting pants too short. these pants are everything they\\'re supposed to be. love nice thick looks great i ordered these pants in gray and orange because they looked like they would be stylish & comfortable.  i must say that i was pleased when i received them.  they run a little short, however i wore the gray pair the day after i received them with knee boots they look great!!! i am 5\\'2\\\\\\\\\" and 125 lbs. and the fit is perfect. i would order more if other colors were avaialable. the only downside is that i didn\\'t like the gold-plated hand that was attached to the front waste band.  i promptly removed it with relative ease and removal did not alter the pants in any way.  if you\\'re looking for an inexpensive pair of harem pants, these are a good choice. super comfy. they were an impulse but one that i\\'m glad i did. they are a nice color and feel so soft. the yoga pants are so comfortable and they fit great. i would recommend these pant to everyone that is looking for a good pair of yoga pants, too bad they don\\'t come in black these are amazing and comfrtable. i had to go a size up because i am tall but they fit amazing. excellent pants! i\\'m 5\\' 4.5&#34; and these work well for my height and weight. the elastic waist and lower legs (take a close look at the photo) also work well. the elastic is substantial, so be aware. (it doesn\\'t bunch, however.) with that said, if you are taller than maybe 5\\' 7&#34; or so (that\\'s a guess on my part), these may be too short. or if you are carrying extra weight around the middle, these might not be as comfy as you\\'d like. fabric weight is light-medium. i would definitely wear heavier socks or tights if it was a cold out.<br /><br />with my height, i can wear the legs down, or bring the elastic up to just below the knee (voil√†, a tulip skirt!). really, a lot of fun! based on the three companies that i have bought from, this one has the most attractive tops.  i haven\\'t tried most of their pants, because of a negative review from another user.  according to the aide taking care of my relative, the pants in this outfit work very well as far as dressing, but there may be an issue with washing.  the sides use velcro, which needs to be closed during washing if it is not to get clogged with lint.  if you do your own washing, and you can remember to close the velcro, then i would recommend this outfit with no reservations.  if someone else is doing the laundering, you might not be able to count on them to be so careful. love these gerber pants!    after much research and reading many reviews, i decided to give these training pants a try, and i\\'m glad i did. they are super soft, sort of a boy-short cut, and have great, light padding at the crotch. boy and girl styles are the same style, other than the fabric choices, so feel free to order any color/fabric. padding area is the same for all.   these pants will be great for potty training and beyond, as they look just like little underpants. so very cute and functional. i plan to buy more. if you are not sure of sizing, order up a size. my daughter is 2 years and 8 months old, but tall (95th%)and quite slim (maybe 33lbs). we got her the 3t, which have room to grow, but are easier to pull down than a 2t would have been. i plan to buy more. great fit - gorgeous look! could be thinker but perfect in all other ways ! i am short so if you\\'re tall you have no worries ! waist was too large fit very nicely.  skin tight but comfortable.  celestial pattern is very nice.  perfect under skirts or with a short dress. love the feel of the material and it feels so light. the length is not perfect maybe i have longer legs that\\'s why. i loved my body is more beatiful. my husband is a seminoles fan and will be forever.  he loves them and found them to be very soft and comfortable for sleeping.  they are not too hot for wearing winter or summer.  he was very happy to get these for christmas and except for me washing them.. or nights that he is working.. he wears them to bed or lounging all of the time, lol.  definitely a great quality and a great buy for a seminoles fan.  amazon deals and the companies that amazon works with makes it so much easier to find unique items that you can\\'t just go into a local store and buy.  i am a very satisfied customer. i ordered these pants a while back.  i knew they would take a while to get here because they came from india.  i love these pants, and i wanted to wear and wash them before i did a review.  they are absolutely amazing.  the adjustable waist made them even better because i am very small up top.  the only bad thing is that they shrunk after a wash and dry sadly.  however, i would just hang dry them instead of putting them in the dryer.  i will definitely order some more to replace my now-too-little pants. love this pants...stretchy and comfy. the only thing is that i am not sure how many washes it will survive! i like this pants, fits perfectly and is very comfy. i have gotten so many compliments on them. these a very comfortable pants to wear around the house or to bed.  sizing is running slightly smaller than advertised, but, does not diminished the comfort of the pants.  i would recommend this to any person, whether a trekie, or not. these pants fit well and are soft and comfortable. i bought this par of pants when i was 5th months and still wearing them ( 9m). very comfy and light fabric that feels like you dont wear anything love these.... i got so many compliments on these leggings! definitely different, but i love them! i would recommend this product to all. the pants fit my daughter perfectly. the material is nice and thick, good for the winter or spring. it fit me too big! but i still liked it because it made me sweat and feel super energized!!! i\\'m 5\\'2 and 115 lbs and these fit just right! they look just like real jeans too! my husband didn\\'t even know they were leggings! i\\'m very happy with this purchase! these pants are amazing and dont make your thighs look like the models. they fit great and theyre comfortable for lounging around or going out! looks good with sandals and a crop top or heels and a nice shirt (: great buy, awesome find, well made and  absolutely adore them. how could ya ever go wrong with tripps :) even had the retail price tag still! only thing is that these didn\\'t come with a spare button like every other pair i\\'ve gotten has had. i chose to order these after reading the reviews.  i am 6\\' 4&#34; 260ish and th xxl fit me perfectly.  most of the reviews complain that they run on the long side, they do and much to my advantage!<br />these are very warm, waterproof and seem pretty sturdy!!<br />i anticipated the waistband to not be the most supportive but i anticipated this and ordered an inexpensive pair of suspenders to go with them.<br />these are great for the money!! i won\\'t buy any other pajamas for my grandson. there are no other pajamas this soft! great product,  please keep in stock,  want to by more this summer!!!! (back to school)!!!  please keep goood products in stock just got the jeans.  wish they came in black.  love the feel it is great!!!! fits well and looks good i had only one complaint with these slacks --- but it\\'s not unusual!!  i am long waisted and high waisted, which means that my pants always have to be hemmed because<br />my legs must be shorter than even the regular size!<br />they are at the cleaners now waiting to be hemmed. i absolutely love this romper! i was a little skeptical about buying it because it was so cheap and the sizing was a little unorthodox. i listened to the reviews and got a medium even though i usually wear a small(i\\'m 5\\'2\\'\\', 118 lbs) and i\\'m glad i did! if i got a small i don\\'t think it would\\'ve gone past my lower body cause i have fairly large thighs. but when its actually on, the waist is a little loose. but it can be easily fixed with a belt! everything fits perfect except the waist! it\\'s the perfect length and isn\\'t too short/long. i ate a huuuge burrito before trying it on and it hid my bloated belly so well. i love it! the pattern is really pretty and the cut is so flattering. the material is pretty nice and even though it is white, you couldn\\'t even tell that i was wearing a black bra under! if you\\'re on the fence about it, get it!! good quality and great fit. it\\'s a great and inexpensive variance to my company-supplied frc. the khaki is a good color and the fit is as-advertised. very comfortable.  liked the fabric.  will get another one in a different color. i live in this pants all spring and summer! i get compliments on them all the time. you couldn\\'t wear a better outfit and be as comfortable with these on. love them and have them in all colors thin material it was a gift and well liked. i am a marine vet.  these are the same as the issue trousers without the ega (eagle globe and anchor) in the pattern.  extremely well made.... love the pants but they run a little big these will be great when the cold weather is gone.  the color is so fresh.  they are so soft, ty! good price. i ordered them too small. just as described, arrived quickly! very comfortable and the print on the joggers is well done. thank you! fit perfect and my daughter was very happy! finally pants that fit!!! i bought a variety of styles in the same fabric for my 7 grand kids, ages 1 through 20. quality is great but the one piece styles run a bit small. color chart is misleading but the pants fit wonderful and are very comfortable! great! holds in large accidents. not 100%water tight but does keep the urine of the floor even in the early potty training stages these leggings are outstandingly comfortable. i love the way they look , feel , & fit on me. i thought it was a little to much money for juss a little pair of tights. but when i talked myself into buying them & i got them , i see why its so much. its everything i\\'ve been looking for. i recommended everyone should get these if they love the color. it will not disappoint you. it certainty didnt too me very nice love these - soft and comfortable. great quality. order your actual size, pants are plenty tall for us tall folks.  if you sweat, lining will stick to your legs. i really like this scrub set. they are very comfortable and look very nice on. i have received alot of noce compliments on them. bought a pair in black last month and i will be buying more colors loved it! see pic for how it fitted. so far these are holding up well. feel good and look good. have become a staple capri pant for a quick outfit my wife likes them. fits well. fits like a us small/med my daughter loves them i haven\\'t worn these yet but they are uber sexy. they fit well and they look really good on. i can\\'t wait to wear them heads will most certainly turn in these. my marine loves this my baby isn\\'t born yet but  i ordered these for 6-9months and they are super soft and well made.  i haven\\'t washed them yet so i can\\'t comment on how well they wash, but so far i am very pleased with this product.  i will be ordering a few more once my little man gets here and i see how big or small he is. i had one son who could tell us he had to go, but couldn\\'t always get to the bathroom and get pants down in time. he would maybe have dribbled a little. these saved us from having to change jeans, socks, shoes, ect.. it looks very nice it fits is expected looks like a jean... soft and nice to feel on the skin comfortable (a bit long, but i\\'m only 5\\'2&#34; so i expected that), made well and reasonably priced, i love them. i just love these pants!!! i am 5\\'2 and about 110 lbs and these pants fit exactly how i was hoping!!! they are quite thin but i ordered them in black so it is no big deal!!! they look great as pants or as a romper. i love how thin the cotton is because in fl it is so hot that these will be perfect for summer or next week possibly hahaha you never know here....i have not washed them yet because i just got them yesterday and was so excited about them!! i am buying them in another color!! :d so happy with this purchase!!! these are great. very comfortable and easy to sit and dance in. doesnt cut you at the hip with the elastic. they run true to the size chart. ill be ordering another pair in red. thank you! bought this outfit for our baby for our upcoming wedding so he didn\\'t have to be in a tux all day. we love it! came on time, packaged nicely and fit baby as expected! very happy! these wet look leggings were a great buy and fit like a glove. they were nice and shiny and looked like real leather! i thought the waste was perfect height and it made my butt pop out real nice. love the way these look and feel. very lovely& beautiful. this was a quality product but way too long for me.  returning was no problem at all, and i was given a credit for the purchase. this is very very good. i do walk 1hr per day and when i remove the capri is heavy with sweat ah ah ah .... meaning loosing excess water.<br />i have big hips ... this will help love these pants. boy is very happy. very soft, comfy & warm inside. i wish that the larges would have been a couple inches longer because i\\'m 6\\'2&#34; and the mediums were only slightly too short for my taste. i heard in an earlier review that the larges were just slightly wider on the waist, but without a longer inseam so i didn\\'t geth them, which is something to keep in mind. over all i thnk that the stirrups just make sense to have and i don\\'t know why other companies don\\'t use them, and the material and fit is pretty nice. perfect with a pair of tights underneath but too thin to be just by themselves for damn cold iowa winter runs. soft. nice quality. i love these! the only nirvana sleep pants i\\'ve found, and i have nearly everything nirvana you could have. the waist is true to size, they are overly long (as are most sleep pants.) they are lightweight, t-shirt type material. they do have pockets, which i think are necessary. the logo god to the knee, it\\'s quite large. i received a pair of these pants for christmas from my youngest sister and i love them! they are light weight and very comfortable, perfect for curling up on the couch while watching your favorite trek (or any other) movie. they are also very comfortable to sleep in. fabric was nice, not terribly thin.  letters were imprinted well, no signs of peeling.  fit was good, an xl fit for a guy who wears a 38 pants size.  basically a normal tee-shirt, no major defects.  i would be happy to purchase another if this one got ruined. the costume looked great and my nephew loved it. he was a hit at the halloween party. i purchased tights from party city to go along with it, and it looked great. it was also a great fit. he wears a 3t. th button came off the first time i tried them on... talk about frustrating, but with a needle and some thread, its a easy fix and the button is quite secure now.<br />the fabric is wonderful, the fit is flattering for a fit individual. i bought thee as work pants. i am not a fan of high wasted pants- at all. but, these are comfortable, and do well for work and any other possible occasion needed. just watch how you wash them, they are true to size and will shrink. looks better on individuals with longer legs, 32&#34; inseam at least i love these, they are the best suit pants i have come across for maternity wear.<br /><br />i know other reviews have complained about the material being thin and not warm, but i don\\'t find it to be any different than most regular dress pants. you\\'re not going to wear them hiking in the snow; these are professional work pants.<br /><br />they fit wonderfully and are very flattering. i\\'d buy them again, if i could find other colors! so cool that they\\'re back! i\\'m going to get a red or black pair--hope they take off and they start making more colors and designs like the old days! good to see minnesota boys make it good...again(my mom went to school with dan stock who co-created them). got these cute yoga pants as a gift. she is rock solid and tiny so they fit her perfectly. material is nice and stretchy and the green at the waist is very pretty. if you or someone you know is a yoga enthusiast, you can\\'t go wrong with this addition to your workout wardrobe! they came sealed in a clear plastic bag and in mint condition. very pleased with this order!!! gave this as a gift and received positive feedback guess i should have ordered the large i\\'m a size 10-12 but happy that the length was perfect fantastic. going to order more when i saw these i wanted them immediately!!! the fit is very good & the look is just fine for man or woman. i knew they would be just what i saw. thailand is always very good for clothing so i had no worries. i hope thailand does not get brought down by all that is happening right now... it was a great product feels great too too tight and not loose color is great and i will definitely will order more good price and style i really like this pant; it is my second pair (previously purchased in brown). they are really comfortable. the only thing that keeps them from perfect is lenght. they are designed for m lenght people and being pretty tall (5.11\\'), they are at the min lenght i would even consider to wear and i am only able to wear them with flats, which is really disapointing to me. these pants are great!! plenty of room. i work in the desert in 100 to 120 degree weather and like these alot more then wearing jeans. they are big but i love them!!!!! really comfortable. i ordered a second one. you could use them under jeans in cold weather.  i am 5\\'9 and they are nice and long. might be too long for a shorter person. cute and comfortable apparently this item is no longer available, which is a shame, because not only is it real wool, the tailoring is exquisite. although my wife sews some of her own clothes she says that she could not come close to duplicating the quality of the tailoring on this tux. it fits me perfectly. i am bowled over that i could get such a fine tux this for such a bargain basement price. excellent! my all time favorite legging and yoga pant brand!!!! if you are hesitant of buying these, please buy them it is really worth it!! they aren\\'t see through and compliment every shape!!!! great pair of sweat pants. only drawback is it has no pockets b good fit,<br />length and waist are fine like the dark black  and feel of the material<br />needs more pockets , the size was a perfect fit. i love it. great only bad thing was they took too long to come i was a bit sceptic about this product, but the truth is that it really makes me sweat a lot more than when i work out with regular work out clothes. good buy. love these pants love, love, love these pants!  love the pockets and the length, thanks so much!  one more request: more colors, please, pretty please!!!! i\\'ve had these pants for a little more than a year (about a year and a half) and i still use them to ride (actually my favorite pairs). only real problems is the zipper is half way broken on one and the other the snap doesn\\'t always stay buttoned, but other than that i live them. (i\\'m also a big girl and in my pants the thighs typically create a hole, and i still don\\'t have a hole in the thighs or in the seams). i liked it and also every one i met liked it. the material is thick and fabulos . only think i don\\'t know how to remove a kiss with red lipstick someone put on my shirt. being a bit confused on sizing after reading the reviews and i needed them right away - i ordered a med. and lg.  i normally wear a 8 in most pants. i am 5\\'4&#34;+ and weight about 135.....also in my 60\\'s.  glad i got the large as it fit the best...since the behind isn\\'t so perky  anymore... i certainly don\\'t need to show it off!!  i am a seamstress and know good quality when i see it...and this is &#34;great&#34; quality for the price!! hope this helps someone. material is on the thin side‚Ä¶and fit is smaller than expected.  order up a size i.e. if you are a 10 order a 12‚Ä¶.(my suggestion)... girl friend loved it! it was perfect and her booty looks phenomenal! it was a gift for her, but ended up being a gift for me ;d love them! good basically everything you want in yoga pants. not see through, tight, comfortable. one thing that is a little annoying is the length. i\\'m 5\\'7, and got a medium. when i\\'m not wearing shoes, the bottoms will hang out under my heels. they aren\\'t super thick, maybe like simple tshirt thickness. but with everything else and the price, i don\\'t mind. great fit and a  great quality too! plenty has been said about the awesomeness of these pants.<br /><br />don\\'t let these pants touch the ground. my spouse dropped them on a dirty floor and i was forced to retire them respectfully by burning them on my homemade 55 gallon drum barbecue.<br /><br />plus i wish they had an option to have the yellow fringe down the outseam like an american flag should have during wartime. as advertised im 5\\'6 and 115 lbs. with no butt what so ever. these are the only yoga pants i will ever buy. eventhough im a skinny person i wear a medium and the fit is perfect and the length is great! can\\'t say enough, finally a pair of yoga pants i can enjoy! :-) i ordered them as a birthday gift for my husband, but i haven\\'t expected him to be so pleased with them. the pants look and feel great on your skin, and are great for cold windy days. thanks to this product, my husband is now a george foreman products\\' fan. really cute fit!  i thought the ones i bought were light brown flowers on chocolate brown background, but it is a black background.  should have looked closer.  still, a cute cut, they fit nicely and are very flattering!  i have them in other patterns and love them.  i am 5\\'4, 155lbs and ordered a large.  they fit fine but were really long.  i hemmed them at the bottom. awesome !!perfect for my kundalini yoga class!! not revealing at all!!! was shipped out fast from distributor<br />overall was perfect. these do seem a little big. but average for this style ;o) namaste very well fitted, but not very sturdy material. arrived fast, and in brand-new condition. material seems to be slighty fragile but still able to wear often. i read the reviews before purchasing.  i am normally a small or about a size 4 but i ordered large due to the multiple reviews about them running small.  they fit perfect!  it takes a minute to get used to the fit (no difference between front and back) but once you wear them a bit you don\\'t even notice anymore.  i love them and so does my hubby! thank you very much and received the package in perfect condition and we are very satisfied and happy with the products i\\'m 5\\'3 and i bought a large and they were a bit long. but besides that their very well put together. i bought this shirt to do a 5k blacklight run and it\\'s perfect! the hulk is super neon. only complaint is that in the picture it shows a different style of black t-shirt than the one that the hulk is printed on. it\\'s still a perfect shirt though. love love them! so comfy! has held up to many washings. love them. loooove them<br /><br />he wears a 40 though so they were to small :(<br /><br />but they were soooooo sexy on him and he loved them as well. these pajamas are darling.  this is the 2nd pair we\\'ve gotten and i love how they look and feel.  we put these on the little one when traveling as they are comfy and nonrestrictive.  the shirt does have a tendency to slip of over the belly on baby, but that\\'s to be expected with any 2-piece outfit. this jumper came in the mail a lot faster than i was expecting:) it fit like a glove, super comfortable and the pockets are a great feature! i bought these pants as a valentine\\'s day present for my husband who is a star wars nut.  he loves them!  he says they are very comfy and wears them almost every night after he gets home from work. thank you for the arrival of purposes at the time reached all-purpose at one time  good quality ... in time with the product and company.  i am slender and these pants are well made and the small size fit me. i like the color.  i like the fit.  wish it had a rear pocket.  but at least they are not grey. i love these pants. they fit perfectly and the material is really soft. also the length is very important to me as i am 5\\'8 and usually yoga pants end up being too short, but these were great! my granddaughter really enjoys the sleeper set l seen well lose he loves them, fit perfect. so beautiful. although i haven\\'t worn them yet because they came out of the package smelling like they had been soaking in gasoline. for the price, i suppose i can\\'t complain. excellents thanks i work out a lot so my jeans fit tightly around my thighs. for these pants, i do not have that problem. i liked how the thighs are a little on the baggy side, really comfy. very cute but not water tight. terry cloth liner is good for dribbles and accidents but not for early potty training when the child can\\'t stop the stream once it has started this yoga pant is awesome. it fits perfectly , the material is nice and soft. not thin at all as previously stated. i would get more colors is they were available. service was great and fast. very pleased with purchase!!! ps-i had look for brown capri yoga pants everywhere and could not find any. üòÇ but amazon came thru for me ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÑ kickee pants are just the right weight and they are also the cutest! i haven\\'t wore these yet. but when i tried them on they fit perfectly. i see already they go with a lot of my shoes. i just pray they don\\'t fade. excellent fine! it fits the quality of these sweatpants is great. i was worried that the lettering would fade or crumble after a few washes but it\\'s still on there as if it were brand new. love this! goes perfect for my reggae show that i do. great fit, great price! love the pants super comfy cute colorful and not too long! these are somewhat more contemporary than old-school palazzo pants. i bought them for a \\'70\\'s theme party and have worn them several times since. i always get looks and compliments. if you have a small waist and large/muscular thighs, these are the pants for you! the cut flatters the booty and flows gracefully from about mid-thigh down. the length adjusts easily by pulling the waistband up or down. great selection of colors, too. they are too slippery to hoop in and a little too hot to do yoga in, but they are perfect for casual/dressy occasions. soooo comfortable!  i love the pattern.  only issue is that they have faded a bit in the wash but that probably is more my fault then the products! these are great - i wished i would have thougt to look online sooner - i purchased regular ones, at least with these if she has an accident her pants wont get too wet ordered the black pair, arrived fast, and good pair of bdu cargo pants good for many occasions.  also fit as expected. got these for my girlfriend and every teen out there always asks where she got them these fleece pants are the cats pajamas and i look forward to putting them on when i get home. my girlfriend loved how soft they were and i\\'m ordering a pair for her as well. the only thing that might keep you warmer  would be a sweet little kitty kat curled up at your feet. i got an xl and i\\'m a size sixteen. they fit perfectly. great fit very cute :-) i love this pants. they are comfy, colorful,unusual, and have great pockets. i will probably buy another pair in a different pattern (i wish there were more patterns to choose from). very good, well-made thermal underwear to help keep little ones warm.  doubles as pajamas.  always good to have thermals handy. my daughters love these pants and plan to get more! these are slightly smaller than expected so i would order a size larger than usual. they are tight on the legs but would have been perfect if i had ordered a size larger than my normal. comfy & light. would recommend not wearing too bright undies. these pants are not see through but slightly if something noticeable is underneath. i have to admit, i love these pants! i wear them every chance i get. the color pops, the trimming is perfect, and i love the design on these pants. i really like these pants. they are light weight, summery, soft, and not too sheer. the only down side is i have a very pronounced back side so if you\\'re like me you\\'ll need to be careful with the undergarments you choose when wearing these pants. i\\'m 5\\'4 and the length was good on me. they can be worn folded over as high waisted or not. overall they are a very nice pair of summer pants! my boyfriend really likes these on me.  i think that they are a little small, but mostly, i like them.  i bought them to walk my dog around the neighborhood.  i wanted something that looked casual, but not bummy.  these pants loosen up a bit after wearing, which is good.  pretty darn happy that i added them to my wardrobe. best yoga pants out there for the price! the suit is made from a nice quality material.  the fit was somewhat small, but not nearly what i thought from the other reviews.  we purchased a large, but could have gone medium (which is actually her normal size).<br />length is nice, if you have longer legs!! i like these pant. i had them in brown and ordered the black. they fit well. good fabric. just hope that ulla popken can improve shipping and shipping cost. it is really the only draw back to ordering from this company that is why i do not give 5 stars. bought this for my hubby with the matching shirt. so super soft, amazing! it\\'s a bit too long for him, he\\'s 5\\'10\\\\\\\\\", but he doesn\\'t mind, he can wear them all day, everyday! totally would buy it again! the pants were a little bigger (baggy) than expected but i like my pants like that so its okay. the fabric\\'s okay, and it fits nicely (although i\\'m not stick-thin, so i don\\'t know how it\\'ll fit someone thinner... the only thing i dislike is the little threads hanging from the cuffs and the slits, not cute... but overall, good product :d the leggings worked well. they fit my daughter perfectly and she is very comfortable wearing them! she wears them a lot! i adore these pants. they are comfortable, yet classy enough for a casual office. this is so incredibly soft, i never want to take it off my baby! we\\'ve had it for a while and it is still as soft as the first wear. this gown is very soft and a beautiful color!  i can\\'t wait to get my baby girl in it.  i also like that it has cuffs to cover baby\\'s hands to keep them from scratching themselves. if these fit, they would be awesome. i thought medium would be fine, but they are quite big. other than that very comfortable. these capris were great for our trip!  fit great and the extra pockets are great!  easy wash and dry ! the pants were a little snug in the waist for xxx. however i did receive compliments for them as a part of my pirate costume.<br /><br />i like that they came with pockets. i bought this and a few others to wear as maternity pants and it does the job well. it\\'s soft and comfy, stretches to give a good fit without being unflattering. perfect training pants and a great deal.  these fit great and are much better for a toddler than the girl panties in stores.  my daughter loved the pink ones! if your looking for a pair of pirate or costume pants, these are just right! they are true to size, ship quickly & are of a good quality. the waist is elastic and has a drawstring, which makes them very comfortable & the buttoned cuffs at the bottom help keep them tucked inside your pirate boots...... i would highly recommend & will probably order a second pair.... :-) we couldn\\'t find any bdu style pants in town larger than a &#34;large&#34;, and what we found cost twice as much as we paid for the pants we ordered on line. they stay up and don\\'t &#34;roll&#34; down at the waist when you sit down. a definite plus, then you\\'re not constantly having to pull them back up.  thanks for carrying them, we\\'ll definitely be ordering more when we can! i swear this is the only place i could find these!!!i looked in so many stores and no dice. these are great for potty training. they are nice and thick so sudden accidents. i reccomend the plastic underwear to wear over them too. love these tye dye pants---so comfy, not too long and i am just under 5\\' 1&#34;---and i even wore them with a slight wedge sandal--the fold over waist helps adjust the length too---just be cautious if you wear out in the rain---of course the hem got soaked and i was stepping all over the pants :( these are a great pair of leggings. the skirt is just great to cover the bottom and class them up a little.  i work with kids quite a bit and these are great for lots of activity.  so comfortable and so warm.  they do run a bit small so you will need to order a size up. i really love the hatley brand of pj\\'s.  these bottoms are a fuller cut, not low and very comfortable.  they wash up very well and look nice never bleeding into my other colors.  i am 5\\'8&#34; and they are the perfect length.  i wear them out of bed in the morning and evening but sleep in uns. these are my favorite pattern so far of amour\\'s leggings.  they\\'re flattering, not too tight and fun for hanging around the house or doing yoga.  i\\'m going to order another pair (#4) in a different pattern soon.  for the price, they\\'re definitely good. also, i wash them in cold water and hang them to dry.  i\\'ve worn them at least 10 times already and the color and stitching is just like the day i received them. comfort a plus, materal not too thin.  great yoga pant.  product has not fallen apart and i have worn them often. this was a gift for my daughter, she loves them. great great pants! looked everywhere in salt lake for this brand, or pants like these with 23&#34; opening for my son. finally ordered these, nice material, made extremely well, especially the stitching, washed them, perfect..no wrinkles either! yes, they shrunk a little as they are 100% cotton, but it made the length just perfect! excellent price! great value! very comfortable and flattering for a costume they will be great. i would like the fabric to be a little thicker though. the length was good as i plan on wearing them with tall boots.<br />i have a 36&#34; waist and 32&#34; inseam. it fits comfortable and the fabric is soft. arrived as quoted, fits well. i am a dog trainer and spend 10-17 miles a day on the road  cardio/ obedience training with my trainees. i was looking for running tights for cold weather and found these. they are true to size, cut well to fit ankle to waist, and 200% better value/ better fit than under armor.<br />a+++<br />will buy again, will recommend to others. i love them they\\'re so cute and very comfy. i wear them to work. my daughter loves the suit but we didn\\'t realize that they had sent one that was 2 sizes larger than we had ordered until tags were ripped off and it was too late to return it. apparently they tend to run small so &#34;as a courtesy&#34; they sent us a bigger size. one size larger than what we ordered would have been great. oh well...she\\'ll grow into it! love these, they are really comfortable. i wish they had been a little more baggy, i prefer them to hang more but they are still very comfortable. highly recommend to any doctor who fan. these are very comfy pants, very soft and stretchy with nice details.  they are extra thick and warm so good for cold winter weather. these are truly gorgeous pants.  material is very heavy, combo of true heavy stretch jersey and tencel; label says polyester and spandex.  doesn\\'t wrinkle.  they only came in 22/24 and bigger, so i knew i\\'d have to take in the waist;  but \\'22/24\\' waistband\\'s front, is over 20\\\\\\\\\" without stretching!  so if your waist is over 40\\\\\\\\\", these pants will fit!  if you\\'re a lot smaller, these swishy pants function like palazzo culottes.  but they make no sound, when you walk.  feel marvelously cool, against the skin.<br /><br />helpfully, the back is elasticized, so can be snapped and tacked, or merely tacked.  waist is always 6\\\\\\\\\" too high, so requires folding over several times;  or, cut the waistband and make a new one;  easy enough to do the latter, just cut, then do a wide hem, then insert no-roll elastic, a 30-minute project by hand while watching tv.  it doesn\\'t shrink when washed in warm water and dried low.  actually i washed it warm and dried high cotton, with (alas) no shrinkage.<br /><br />overall, this is a wonderful stretch jersey with a feel-good swing when you walk;  dresses up any sweater or blazer you use to top it.  worth fixing.  matches the other red ochre stuff, color true to picture.  think dark reddish terra cotta adobe.  yay. this hat is still a little large on my 6 month old, so it should fit her through 12 months. the tassles are adorable, especially when she is bouncing in her bouncer :-) very cute with a comfortable & stylish fold down waist.  my daughters (18 & 20)loved them. these pants are very cute and the material is nice. the only bad thing is the sizes run a little big. very comfortable. expensive but worth it.  and they help give roundhouse kicks to the face much easier.  forget about it. perfect for a jasmine costume. fits perfect and im a tall girl. was not too snug around the wast eeiteither. my daughter is picky about her clothes and prefers any color except pink.she really prefers black clothes with skulls on them,she doesn\\'t always get her way! the pants look exactly they did online, except they don\\'t fit like high waist pants. besides that i love them!! i looove these leggings! the only problem i have was that after a couple of times wearing these the bows came undone from the stitching.. it kinda sucked but i think it stills looks good. i would recommend, there super cute! great fit and quality. not meant for tall people.. i am 5\\\\\\\\\"6 and they fit well but are a little to short,i don\\'t mind because i can pull them into the capri style but overall cute, legging material, my thighs are a little big so they fit tight,not like the picture. one size does not fit all! overall good deal for the price would buy again if they offered different lengths and sizes. cool britches the fit was fantastic, my husband always has trouble with the length but these pants come in his size!  this is what he needed.  thy will last hims for years as the fabric is a heavy duty cotton!  he loves the pockets! so comfortable and not too short! i want them in every color! comfy pants & they seem well made.  may be short on you taller ladies, but perfect for me at 5\\'3\\\\\\\\\".  unfortunately these pants out of stock, or i would have ordered 1 more pair. so comfortable! it feels like i\\'m in my pajamas. good durable pants very nice on they have 2 tactical pockets on which i love. pockets are very durable and are quite fancy. the pants are beautiful and the dye is very vivid. the size seemed true to me. i did order a size larger thank i normally would, but i wanted these to be like hammer pants....<br /><br />the cut of the pants prevents them from being hammer pants, but they are plenty baggy and i like them.<br /><br />i am undecided about the material. it doesn\\'t seem soft or sturdy. it is hard to describe the feel of the material, but, i think that after a few washes it is going to be much softer and maybe even a little thicker....<br /><br />these are definitely not as heavy as sweatpants, i would not suggest that you wear these on cold days without a thermal layer. very cute and soft, love that they are footed! love these i would order again . strings arent real though very warm plush feeling dressed up or down very versatile i love the customer service also.the fit small but because strings arent real i didnt order bigger size does have a bit of stretch to them so just be easy when you shimmy in ...lol  dont want seams to rip i didnt see any poor stitching i love them got alot of compliments i gave these pants to my grandson for christmas and he said that he loves them.  thank you very much!i am very happy to have done business with you. these are great shorts, just as described! they are well made, fit well, and are super comfortable! i ordered 2 pair of these, black and white, and will order some other colors asap! i love these! i wear them around the house and to workout in! they do fit true to size. i recommend these to everybody! i am 5\\'6 and wear a 16/18.  the xl fit great - except those darn extra two inches.  and they are going to be more difficult to hem because of the flare leg.  that said...i\\'m hemming.  love the wide band and good fit.  nice and opaque.  fit nice without showing the saggy baggys and dimples too much!  will bookmark and if the hemming goes well will buy again when they have more colors. as stated above ^^ i\\'m a huge harry potter fan! can\\'t go wrong with these! sexy and comfortable. great for lounging. not thick enough for extreme cold though. it\\'s very hard to find this style of clothing for lower price in bigger sizes. i love these pants sooo much. waistband is not as tight as expected and they ride down a lot. i\\'m constantly pulling them up! otherwise they\\'re great! these are very well made little pants- fully finished, and the waist cuff offers some flexibility with sizing.  when you get them, they will look huge for the size- but after washing, they shrink as cotton does, to a truer fit for the size ordered.  i use these for reborn preemie dolls, and customers want nice specialty clothing- these are always well received.  the only possible \\'down\\' side for a real baby would be if the waist were folded down, and it might be a little bit of a \\'ridge\\' for a tiny baby\\'s back.  otherwise, excellent. good uniform its very usefull for warm or hot areas this uniform will keep u fresh.. shipping was super fast when i bought these shorts the estimate shippin was between nov-dec. which i was a little worried about since i\\'m planning on wearing then in nov. and i got them just in time! they fit perfectly i was a little scared about the fit since there wasn\\'t an exact size to choose from, overal i\\'m very satisfied with my purchase! these pants can worn casual, sporty with sandals or sneakers and the way fit in the waist is very comfortable. great quality for the price and fast shipping. i love em. highly recommend this seller. i was happier when i received them. they look way better in person than in the picture. great for any woman looking for some comfortable football wear. i absolutely love these. the are extremely comfortable and can pass off as sweats so i can wear them to school (then again, it\\'s not like i haven\\'t worn pajama pants to school...). the length is perfect and they are true to size. buy these and share your slytherin pride haha no, but seriously, i do recommend you buy these if you are in deed considering. awesome i loved it. they\\'re extremely comfortable. i love the fit and the soft material. i would buy more colors. it arrived on time and happy with my purchase. the quality of these pjs is very good but the size 4t i bought would barely fit a cabbage patch doll, let alone my 3 year old grandson who wears that size. true to size, sits at natural waist.  the product arrived on time and are very comfortable.  they will be great for the spring and summer at work. shipping may take a while because of where the item is coming from, but the price is good and the leggings fit as expected.  many cool designs offered, so i plan to order from them again. super soft fuzzy pants - they\\'re bigger than i\\'d expected and baby won\\'t fit into these until she is over 6 months of age (and she\\'s average-sized) but that\\'s okay - she\\'ll grow into them. when i had ordered the pants for the first time, i had received something completely different from what i originally wanted. i immediately contacted the seller and conveyed my distraught. after unnecessarily complaining so much, they sent a couple of letters of apology and went out of their way to ship a new pair within two days for free. i of course felt very bad for the way that i reacted and sent them a letter of apology. the seller replied in the sweetest manner and kept on checking up on me afterwards. it was definitely a satisfactory purchase and i will continue to buy from this seller in the future. good material for price. wish it came in xs sizes. most \\'american\\' sizes run larger than the \\'asian\\' sizes but the small is too large for me in the crotch/ tummy region. i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; and weigh 105 lbs. may have it tailored a bit since it\\'s a bit too large to actually wear for me. they\\'re good quality pants and they look cool but i got them bc i couldnt find a cheap pair of girl tripp pants i missed the first but i contacted and they sent me another.<br /><br />omg. these are awesome. many compliments!!!! i really like the fit - although they do run a bit large - because i wanted a baggy look with my crop tops. they are sturdy and comfortable and end up kind of stylish with my boots and a lace top. i was so happy when this product arrived. they fit so perfectly and were easy to get on. not only that but they are comfortable and look amazing! this truly was the perfect buy and well worth it! very good value.  fits true to size. babies out grow clothes so fast how can you go wrong! i love the pants. they look good and fit great. we bought these for our 17 month old, he was already toileting (because we did do elimination communication, sort of, part-time), and within a week he was completely out of diapers, even at night.  we cloth diapered both of our boys but it was very hard to find a good cloth training pants option - until we found these!  what we love about these is that they really do make toileting easy.  no more messing with the on-and-off of diapers (we used prefolds with a snappi) and yet they are more than just a cloth training pant.  if he pooped in them, they were as easy to change as a regular cloth or disposable diaper.  yet, toilet time was as easy as un-velcro, go, and slap the tabs back together - which is a cinch even while he\\'s running away from us!  they hold one pee with no problem and you can add extra absorbancy if you need to, right in the pocket, without an insert falling on the floor at potty time.  the sizing is great if you follow the actual measurements on the manufacturer\\'s website and not the weight.  our son fits well in the medium, he is 24 pounds but skinny in the waist and legs.  we highly recommend these training pants! very cute outfit but the top is difficult to get on and off.  if there were snaps at the neckline to make it larger, then the outfit would be perfect.  the pants waistline is a little too snug as well.  the style and quality is amazing - it\\'s one of my favorite outfits for my son. legs are a little long but overall nice. theres one pocket and they are a soft and smooth texture love the pants, but they seem to fit a little small. pro: beautiful design, absolutely love it;<br />con: it\\'s a one size fits all (s,m, l, xl), with me being xsmall in size the waist band elastic is two inches above my belly button- i fold it down 3 times. i love the pattern of this sleek fabric.  it fits great, but being 5\\'4&#34;.  i had to take some off the hem.. they fit nicely and are so comfortable, it\\'s like wearing pajamas or yoga pants but much more stylish!  i wish they had more in different patterns and colors.  i would buy them all!! s is  pretty large on me: 5.4, 122 lb, can wear them only after washing but the quality is good, so nice for the price the elastic allows you to wear them as pants or shorts and they\\'re really warm and durable. perfect for warming up at the barre. i have purchased a couple of harem style pants and these are by far the best!! super comfortable and soft and are very flattering for my shape! these panties are wonderful for potty training my 2 yr. old. they are soft and comfortable and the padding in the middle is just the thing for accidents. :) very soft and comfy but they are a junior size so they are snug in the hips. i am 5\\' 2&#34; and weigh 105 and the small fit perfect length wise but just a little snug in the upper thigh/hip area. i wish these came in women sizes. i think if i went up a size they would be too big though and defintely too long. also the soft material makes every bit of fuzz stick to them but i really do love these! i recently got into wearing tights, these are super trendy and fun, i would recommend them to anyone, super comfy too! just fine - what my son needed.  the only problem was that we didn\\'t know the lining was red and my son was not happy about that.  otherwise, great! these pants are so weird, it is very wide, as some reviewers said-like genie pants. it looked ridiculous on my baby when i tried them on her at 4 months. it looked like the pants swallowed her up. so, i had tossed it aside into a storage container, until she was around 15 months. the weather was getting nicer and i thought these would be perfect. yep! she was getting taller so these looked like capris, but was perfect for the beginning of spring. it did still look a little wide, but no longer ridiculous looking, it actually looks cute!  now she is 20 months and these are still fitting well (the waist band is really stretchy), however i wanted to prepare for the upcoming cold weather with longer length, so i ordered the 6-9 months in the polka dots/pink pack. weird indeed it is again, this time it isn\\'t wide at all! it looks like more of the normal width pants...yeah i can\\'t figure it out. same brand same type....and it\\'s just different.  so, if you are looking to get 3-6 months size, keep in mind it\\'ll run large-so it\\'ll look better when your baby is bigger. the recent 6-9 months size is really cute too. the product came to me well and on time, without any problem, i\\'m already using and it works perfectly, totally recommend. great jeans! one of my favorites! i don\\'t know what the other person was talking about in their review, these pants do not go up past my bellybutton at all. i am 5\\'3&#34; and they end just below my belly button, right where high rise jeans usually do. they are a good straight-leg high rise jegging. not very skinny in the ankle but a good fit around the waist, hips, and thighs which is very important to me. great for work because if you don\\'t have to tuck your shirt in or if you wear an apron they almost look like straight slacks. overall a classy pair of jeggings with a nice shape. good transaction but the pajama bottom/loungs pants seem to run a little small...a \\'large\\' should actually been big on me and these just fit. soooo...i will have to take care that they don\\'t shrink in the laundry. loves these pants, but i took others advice and ordered  a size up.  i\\'m glad i did. i am having a problem believing anyone has ever bought a pair of these pants.  they really look good and are very well illustrated.  if someone purchases a pair, do you really think he would say he was disappointed?  no, i think he would be praising these pants as being the best in the world. very sharp looking vest great value for what you get. <br />these little pants do the trick for a decent price. fit perfectly. they are body conscious and classy with some detailing. i would get more in fall/winter colors soon. the shipping was fast. i love these so much! first pair of jack pjs i have owned and they fit and feel great! i just wish they had pockets. given as a gift very, very nice sweat pants. great quality, great fit. the logo on the leg is very unique. a strong full waistband. great drop in the leg they look like real jeans, theyre comfortable, i am happy i purchased this, i would be deffinitely be getting more of these. these tripps are pretty awesome. i can tell the fabric is kinda of thin but i love em anyway. i ordered a size 36/38 and it fits just right. not to tight and not too big. very comfertable. the white color is a true white. plenty of chains for my liking.     the only thing i didnt like is the metal skull pendants on the front. they are smiling when  i would rather them look evil but you wouldnt notice unless you are up close.     other than that these tripps are good for the money. i was very sastified with my purchase so i will definetly shop within their brand again ^__^ this is my second pair of these pants. i wore my first pair all the time, received many compliments. the high quality material lasted 4 years. now i have a new bright pair. great product. prompt delivery. i am so excited that these pants fit!  i\\'m 6\\'1\\\\\\\\\" and buying pants has always been hell period, never mind shopping online or getting anything in any color other then standard black, navy or brown.  i bought a large instead of a medium (my usual size) and they fit perfectly.  i figure they may shrink in the wash and are stretch pants after all.  they material is a bit thin and you can see a panty line for sure but it\\'s whatever.  they are long as advertised and come in fun colors.  also they came really quickly in the mail.  i\\'m happy. great fittings and feeling pants. the strap really holds them in place with running and they have just the right tightness around the legs. perfect fit i usually wear a size 7 and a medium fit me great. they\\'re super comfortable and soft. i would definitely recommend them. just put in 3. 5 miles in 30 degree f weather today.  these pants were light weight and warm. great gear for running in the tundra. i have just received my second pair of white ultrasofts; need two for summer.  i have a tan pair and a black pair.  i prefer these over others that i have. very long which i appreciated but a little large in the front, great fit, nice spandex fabric, deep black color that does not fade or deteriorate with washes. very confy. fits my 9 year old daughter and myself. great buy. they work well during the day (can hold 1 pee) but aren\\'t great for naps (afternoon or night) (can leak on to mattress). either way i like the product. my daughter was potty trained at 20 mos. i started pull ups at 19 mos when we stepped out of the house. the rest of the times it was just cotton panties at home. in retrospect i should have skipped the whole huggies pull up phase (or used them only at night). i should have just moved to these gerber training pants.     one thing: i was rather disappointed after i got the panty out from the dryer. i followed instructions and it says you can tumble dry on low heat. i did just that but the outer vinyl lining gave way in many places (tiny tears) plus it now has a wrinkled appearance. so please air dry.     points:  1) great for small accidents during the day.   2) much better option than disposable pull ups.  3) the plastic can irritate the thigh region.  4) it might be too hot to wear in summer.    update: i wrote to gerber regarding the vinyl layer giving way in the dryer. they responded very promptly and professionally. they sent me 2 new training pants plus a few coupons. this skit is so nice. i am a size 6 and the xl fit perfect. nice thicker material. i\\'m sure i\\'ll be wearing this skirt a lot. ty awesome! i just got these today and i\\'m already cursing that they don\\'t come in more colors.<br /><br />as far as what to expect, these are basically thicker leggings constructed to look like trousers. (back pockets are functional, fly is not.) while they do have a good amount of stretch, be mindful that it\\'s not too little to compress any lumps or bumps, but there\\'s also not too much so that they\\'re falling off your rear after a few hours.<br /><br />for sizing, they are in line with other wallflower products, which means you might want to size down. i wear anywhere from an 18-22 depending on the manufacturer, and with anything from wallflower that has a good amount of stretch, i\\'m always glad when i order a 20.<br /><br />also, i\\'m 5\\' 7&#34;, and these pants &#34;bunch&#34; a bit at my ankles, but not in a way that bothers me. that being said, if you\\'re shorter than 5\\' 4&#34; i would recommend knowing how to hem or making friends with someone who does.<br /><br />i cannot truly express how thrilled i am with these pants. i buy a fair amount of clothing on amazon, and i feel like i\\'m always returning it because it doesn\\'t fit right- not so with these beauties. if they made them in black and green i\\'d be in heaven! magnificent! i didn\\'t know how good i could look in yoga pants until i got these! i\\'m 5\\'10&#34; and they are still longish on me. that is rare, rare, rare! i think i will order another pair! love these, wish they had larger sizes! i\\'m in love with palazzo pants, they are my new addiction! i have several pairs now and they are becoming a staple in my wardrobe. with so many fun patterns to choose from and a ridiculously comfortable fit, you can\\'t go wrong with them. they do a great job at hiding the little imperfections, and are incredibly versatile. you can dress them up with a cute top and heels for a night out, or dress them down with a tank top and flip flops.i get compliments on them pretty much every time i wear them. and best of all, you can customize the length for your height. with a pair of scissors and a steady hand, just cut off the bottom to your desired length and voila\\'! no need to hem them either because they don\\'t fray! i love these pants! i now have burgundy, purple, pink, blue and green. i love them because i am losing weight and these are the perfect price do i can wear them out and the look professional ( longer shirt to cover the band or flip the band up for some tummy control)  buying jeans while i\\'m dropping lbs is not an option! too pricey, and i can head to the gym from work without changing. they don\\'t stretj out when you wear them all day, i have some pants similar that by the end of lunch hour k can\\'t keep them up! thick material and a solid waste and no droop! after washing and drying only minimal shrinkage but after q few minutes of wear they are comfortable but still flattering and that shape holds all day. even after doing cardio. i saw other reviews where they stated they were too long.  i am 5\\'7&#34; and i love the length.  they are extremely comfortable.  i wear them to work out in and when hanging out.  i\\'ve also washed them in hot water without any shrinkage.  the only con i noticed is that i did get some pilling on the inner thighs.  it\\'s not noticeable and i would buy these pants again.  i bought a large and they fit perfectly. love these !!!  so soft and comfortable, great quality, and great fit ! will buy again i\\'m 5\\'10&#34; and wear size 10 pants, and these pants look and feel awesome. my husband says they make me look skinny in a good way. i love the length. i got another pair of harem pants made with patterned fabric from the same company that are not long enough, but these are great. also, unlike the other pants, the elastic around the ankles is not too tight in these pants. the fabric color is navy like the picture, not royal blue like the description says, which is perfect for me because i wanted navy. i first ordered four pairs with matching tops, and have worn them while traveling through three countries this summer with compliments greeting me everywhere i went.  the are sooooo very comfortable, i just ordered four more pairs in different colors.  i plan on wearing these around the house, instead of my pj\\'s, too.  they are light, comfy, and pack very well.  while traveling, i would just wash, lightly dry and hang up, never needing to iron them.  i was not that picky about the ironing because i was traveling and getting crammed and jammed into various modes of travel.<br /><br />highly recommend! i\\'ll give you the short and sweet, refer to nutnfancy\\'s video review on youtube if you want a fine detailed review from someone who has used them extensively in various settings.<br /><br />these pants fit great, the lower pockets are not quite the best design but they\\'re definitely functional. the knife pockets are somewhat awkward and will not fit larger folding knives, but i find it perfect to carry pens in as they don\\'t get in the way when you\\'re sitting down or moving around. i could see things falling out of the main front pockets if you\\'re sitting constantly sitting down and standing up at your job but i haven\\'t experienced it and i\\'ve only used them for a day so i could be completely wrong on that. back pockets are fine, i\\'m not the biggest fan of the sewn corners but i\\'ll get used to it. again the fit is great, i don\\'t have to wear a belt with them at work which i love, and i could see myself buying more of these and wearing them in all settings.<br /><br />i definitely recommend these pants. good product works as designed comfortable summer pants and they look and fit great. very comfortable well made and wash well good purchase for anyone who likes the walking dead when i first opened them i thought there was no way i would fit into them, [5\\'7&#34;/127lbs] they looked tiny and put them aside for later. to my surprise i could and i love them, would prefer if the waist was draw string and looser elastic. they hang well and love the deep pockets. i should have gone with the medium... my fault for thinking imported meant they would be smaller. very cute and nice material. i took the advice of another reviewer and ordered the large. i usually wear a size 12-14, they were a tad loose and after i washed them they fit a little better. they do not shrink that much if you follow the washing directions. very warm pants, bought these to wear under my bibs, should work great! it looked good on me and i\\'m a curvy girl. i love it. pants are adorable and fit well.  i ordered them for my grandson, obviously i meant to order the &#34;boys&#34; pack.  i returned the item without any problems.  now i\\'m anxiously awaiting the right ones for my grandson.  patterns are really cute for a baby girl. great for summer i have about an acre that i either have to mow or keep clear of weeds. these are comfortable work pants that provide protection from thrown pieces of brush, and allow carrying many tools. i wear a small in these pants (i\\'m almost 5\\'6\\\\\\\\\", 115 pounds), and they fit perfectly, not like a yoga pant but with a little room like a golf pant.  they are so comfortable that i\\'m having trouble finding other golf pants i can stand to wear.  i only wish these came in other colors.  i\\'d order them all.  update:  these pants now come in other colors - navy and a nice bright purple. these pants are made of super soft cotton and they are so deliciously comfy! i\\'m 5\\'6\\\\\\\\\" and they are the perfect length for my legs. the embroidery is so beautiful! i\\'ve already washed mine a bunch of times and they are holding up beautifully. thanks atta apparel! excellent quality, great for running.<br />runs a bit small. nice these are the best work pants with built in knee pad pockets that i have worn!  lightweight, yet tough fabric is easy to wear all day and pockets for the knee pads are in the perfect location.  similiar pants i\\'ve tried have the knee pad placement too low on the shins. bought for my brother. he is 6 ft. and they fit him perfect.  he loves them! the 50% cotton, 50% poly should wear well.  they are good pants but nothing special and i think a little expensive.  potential buyers may want to shop the product. fit great and are amazing! thanks again! i liked this very nice i needed a pair of work pants and these worked great! so comfy and cute too these pants are true to size. material is of decent quality. pants are very flowy and great weight for summer wear. this is a good buy for warm pants to shovel snow which is what we bought it for. roomy too! i\\'m 5\\', and these pants are perfect length!  they are so comfortable, i could sleep in them!  they are a bit see through throught, so be careful in panty selection!  any color but black really pops out in the camera! these are nice, lightweight pants that will be great for zumba class.  the only problem is the waistband is way too tight!  the rest of the pant fits great.  i usually wear a size 6 so i ordered the small.  i may try to take the drawstring out of the waistband and see if that makes a difference.  otherwise, i will probably need to get a medium just so the waistband allows me to breathe. excellent material love it... will probably be buying more of these. right length (i\\'m 5\\'7&#34;), right amount of tightness, great material. well made, hand wash, hang to dry, no ironing & comfortable yet stylish! you will love this versatile change from the pants, dress and shorts options for summer! i am very tall and length is great worn as a jumpsuit. add one of amazons cute shrugs or shawls & you have a great addition to your summer and early fall wardrobe. highly recommend! these are, hands down, my favorite pair of pants. i\\'ve been nomadic for about two years now and these pants go everywhere, wash easy, dry fast, never wrinkle...  i\\'ve slept in them, worn them to nice restaurants, worn them while hauling trash in post-katrina new orleans. i love them. i will wear them as long as the company makes them. have not received them as of 2/19/15 , but the ones i have ordered in the past fit well and are ok for the price. unfortunately i thought the fabric would be more of a thin khaki type of material, but it\\'s more of a nylon stretchy fabric. other than that, i love them. they breathe easy and don\\'t wrinkle that much even though i fold them and have them in a dresser drawer. i love harem pants, so the fit is great for me. sweet!!!! my daughter loved her new belt!!! it was an awesome buy, will definitely purchase more for my other kids, i was amazed to find such a variety of comic characters!!! definately a good decision if your looking for this type of stuff the desert digital is a versitile pattern and the quality of these rothco bdu\\'s is extremely good for the price i would recommend rather than a surplus store. super fast shipping was great bought for my granddaughter, these are thick enough to be cozy and modest. they are colorful and cute and she likes them.. looks exactly like the picture! fits very loose to  hide the middle, snugs the chest perfect, no worries on it slipping! ordering another :) these are my favorite yoga pants ever! they are extremely flattering and fit perfectly. the fabric is also very soft and not too thin. awesome fit, my wife loves them! price was great, too! had to return first order and get one size bigger. but she liked the style so much this was no problem. love these pants! came package perfect , love it . got for my daughter for christmas i love these onesie pants! they are nice and long, and fit my 2 1/2 year old. it\\'s hard to find thin pants for older toddler boys, so they are perfect. the little pocket on the back is so cute too. i\\'ve been looking for a good cheep pair of phats pants (those wide bottomed rave pants) and i found these. all the phats that i found have all the neon stripes and cool signs on them and are priced around 140$ to 250$!!!!!!!11 their amazing. the material is thin but durable. the waist has a string to tighten. the only thing that was disappointing was that there were no belt loops for a belt or suspenders. they have mesh pockets down the side (perfect for glow sticks). just don\\'t wear them in the rain. there suppose to touch the ground! their perfect for melbourne shuffling. also a heads up for people wanting to buy suspenders... my advice is to try to make your own. for the price and all the trouble of buying them online. going to a fabric store and buying the material for rain coats in bright colors, getting an edging, getting the right kind of clasps... it\\'s totally worth it. and you can make 3-4 pares and sell them. so if you want to hook your suspenders to your phats... buy grommets from a fabric store. btw grommets are those holes in the edge of tarps. my daughter loves her hammer pants nice i love them fits so good !!!!! but i did get a bigger size did not want my butt crack showing fantastic, and survived several accidental trips through the dryer. if you are looking for a sturdy wool product for your baby, this is the way to go. would probably be too small length-wise by 6 months (and this isn\\'t just due to drying), but perfect on a rather long 3 month old. the fabric is a little thin to really mimic leather, but they are super comfy for a night out when i want to be low-maintenance \\'guy hot.\\' would get more colors if offered! she liked them! bought these for a long-legged girl, and the crotch is too low. quality is fine and the print is smashing! wish they\\'d fitted, but for ten bucks delivered from china, i am fine just giving them a try. these were great then after a few wears and washes the seam on the inside of the thigh area came undone. i really like these pants. very cozy and fun to work out in. i love this show and the looks i get when i wear this shirt is priceless.  my psych collecion just keeps on growing.  the shirt was made well and has so far lasted thru several washings. absolutely love my soa lounge pants. they are so comfortable,  lots of room to move in.  totally cool. god quality.  not too heavy of a pant. just honestly perfect. i got an xl but a l would have been better. but i\\'m still very happy with my cool soa lounge pants. i totally recommend these to any soa fan. fits well,color and fabric are terrific. purchased both blue and gray. would buy again and recommend very highly to others perfect! comfortable! i bought the military color because they were the only size 3 in stock.   these pants are great!  they\\'re extremely comfortable, functional and the fit is very complimentary (form fitting or loose where they should be).  they\\'re made of light weight very soft cotton. the only down side is the waist, it\\'s a little big so you\\'ll need a narrow belt since the front two loops only have about a ~0.5\\\\\\\\\" wide opening. i love these jeans but they need to come in lengths ! i wear a petite so i had to hem mine and i hate sewing ! also, they are cut a little small to size. i was \\\\\\\\\"sandy\\\\\\\\\" in a dance competition. these shiny black leggings looked just like hers in grease. they fit to a t and were so comfortable and easy to move and dance in. and i got a ton of compliments on them. they were perfect! perfect winter pants. been wearing 5.11 brand for years, but these propper brand pants cost less and are far superior in both design and material. the pockets within pockets design is genius and very handy. the material is thicker, windproof, very rain resistant, and perfectly sewn. every stitch is in place. the packaging, included web belt, and delivery time excellent. i returned to buy four more pair from vendor cat5. my son loves it. it\\'s soft against the skin, and it just looks good. thinking of getting a few for myself. perfect! got these as part of a joke. the pants are of heavy material and look like they will last for a while. fit great. super cute and comfortable item as described i love the pants however wrong color. fit great soft and cuddly no matter what holiday you\\'re celebrating, these are the cutest little pjs for any little boy you know. i can\\'t wait to give them to my grandson for christmas! the fit was perfect. my daughter is tall and we couldn\\'t find any that wouldn\\'t shrink and be too short on her. these are great and didn\\'t shrink and she just loves them. these are the type of yoga pants i have been looking for. i like them snug to my legs but them loose at the ankle.  will be ordering more in black and grey if you have them. :) i ordered both the hot pants and matching zipper bras of these items<br />got them in white, yellow, blue, pink, black, & red<br /><br />i use them in my photography studios, and the models love them<br /><br />for the one size that fits all, well just make sure you are using the right size model<br />some models should not be wearing form fitting clothing.<br /><br />over all they were a great addition to my photography studio wardrobe.<br /><br />hope they get more colors in...<br /><br />photographer:kirby<br />bigeasystudios.biz these fleece lined leggings arrived on time and were packaged well. the leggings  are of good quality and are very soft inside as well as being warm and cozy! this product fit the baby well. till this day she is still able to fit them to wear around the house. love them they are exactly what i was looking for they fit and the fabric is soft the product matches the picture and fits very snugly and seamlessly. it is very comfortable and i would recommend this to people if this is what they are looking for. they fit okay, kind of snug (im a size 5/6). they really do look like jeans, but you have to wear leggings underneath them because they are see through. other than that, great buy. bought these for my husband, and he loves them. very soft. they arrived in a very timely manner. i love them .it is my second pair and will be ordering more. they are so comfortable and thick enough that you can go in public and not feel awkward. thanks they are a little big but are fun to wear.  i can wear them as pants or capris and look good with casual or dressing up.  also received them two weeks before estimated delivery date. very elegant and easy love these! they are so warm and comfortable, but so cute as well! most yoga pants are too short or too baggy.  i love how these fit!!!  favorite yoga pants.<br />this review is for the purple, i also got the black but they don\\'t fit as well. these fit great, i got my size, 36-39, fits right, high quality material, comfortable to wear and rugged on the outside. the pants fit just right, fast shipping thanks. i love these capris a lot! they fit as expected and i love them! i would definitely buy them again! they fit perfectly but only problem is after a few times of wearing them, the stitches on the butt area were coming apart. haha oops. my first true pair of yoga pants that fit me.  my husband wants me to buy more, he thinks they look hot!  they are very comfy too.  i am 5.4&#34; weigh 115 pounds and got a large. the fabric, manufacture and look are great but way too long....i\\'ve been wearing 40 30 for many years and they were labled that but were probably 40 33 i have been looking for a super comfortable, easy to wear pair of cozy pants that i could still pull off wearing out of the house (dress up a tiny bit) and took a chance on these. i really debated which size to order because, per-pregnancy ( pregnant with #2 right now) but still holding onto baby weight from #1, i am right in between the two sizes.  from other reviews it looked like they were not that different, just maybe a little more \\'give\\' in the waist in the larger size, so i went with that b/c i carry most of my weight in my middle (obviously right now with a baby belly, but even without, and for awhile postpartum) i\\'m 5\\'1 and they are a bit long (which i expect in everything i buy...) but i\\'m going to wear and wash for a bit and see if they shrink up, otherwise they look like they\\'d be super easy to cut off the ends a bit. no big deal.<br /><br />they are soooo comfortable, flattering, and cozy.  i instantly came on here to order another color, and when i can find the 3rd color will order that one as well.  i can see myself using these for the rest of this pregnancy and for a long, long time after so while i was hesitant to spend that money on pants like this, it\\'s well worth it. harry potter geek here! love these pants. i bought these in an xl because i am 5\\'11 and they were a little short and after washing they are even shorter. more like capris now - which is okay because i am a girl, but i can see that being an issue for others. the fabric is soft though and the logo looks great, even after washing. i got these for my wife and she loves them.wants more for christmas but would like to see more colors.she claims they are very warm in the winter. i  bought them for my wife and i love the way they fit her. great gym pants to work out in in professional wrestling so they fit perfectly and i cant complain! thank you fantastic!!! unlike a few of the reviewers, i found the quality of these pants to be top notch (although i have by no means pushed these pants to their limits). they are standard acu pants. however, i found the sizing to be a little off. for most pairs of \\\\\\\\\"fits most\\\\\\\\\" pants, i tend to be medium-long, but with these, the ankle cuffs went well over my feet (i\\'m 6\\'1\\\\\\\\\"). if you\\'re around my height, plain medium should be fine for you. love these. they only last about 6 months, but for the price it\\'s fair. just bought my second pair. super comfy, and attractive. the waist band could be a little looser, and i am size 0/2, and i wish they had other colors, but they are lovely. if you love. yoga  you will love this  type of pants the are cool  and it give you. a great display  when wearing  it the material is soft  cool for any whether  wash great little or no iron super cute and comfy bought these for an 80s metal costume. i got tons of compliments on them. they are very fun pants. the length on these was fine, but they fit quite snug. i generally wear a 6-8 or medium. i ordered a medium, and i had to stretch a ton the first time i tried them on. on the other hand, it sort of held everything in nice and tight. i also found that they started to slip down as the night progressed. not sure if it was due to the size, but i did notice slight discoloration after taking them on and off a few times. it probably wasn\\'t noticeable to other people, would\\'ve just looked like light reflecting in different ways. still, for the price, they were a good find. i would recommend them. great quality... i love the difference in color blocking and material.<br />its a perfect mix of texture and color.<br />recommended nice and look different when you wearing it because it has the funny print.<br />but please order one size up when you order it because it too tight on your leg and it makes your skin shows up instead of the print itself.<br />and please do hand washing process only worth the money, don\\'t get them dirty, cuz they is so fresh i wear a large top & a petite medium pants.<br />i shop a lot on amazon and i love the fact that you do not have to buy a set (as sellers usally sell sets)<br />i purchased the coral top (large) & bottoms (petite medium) what a perfect fitand (oh my what a pretty color)<br />i have just ordered two more sets 1 set = navy blue & 1 set = heather grey.<br />i am getting ready for the long cold winter here in upper ny state.<br />i hope this review will help you.<br /><br />i have not washed the set yet and i pray these will not gather little balls on them.<br /><br />i\\'ll come back and let you know after washing the set.<br />be blessed and be happy.<br /><br />i have order another set the sweatshirt & sweatpants (in the coral color). right now i have purchases 4 sets.<br />the sweatshirts & sweatpants are all purchased seperatly.<br /><br />i have washed and dryed all the sets. they come out very nice. i do turn the sweats inside out when i wash n dry them.<br />i do not dry for a long time, maybe 10-15 min and the i finish drying them on a hanger.<br />i am trying very hard not to get those nasty balls on my sweats.<br />i hope this will help you decide if you would like to purchase these sweats.<br />for my money, they are worth the money. mainly because i can order the proper sizes that i need.<br />i do not work for the company if you check on my reviews you will notice i purchase many items through amazon as<br />i love their customer service. i have (never) had a problem sending some items back. love them these fit well and are just what i wanted. a good price for linen pants. the cut is very flattering. my wife loves it. she asked me for 2 pants, i searched a lot and she is very happy with !!! medium (40) is like a usa size 7 love the way it looks on me, had to pay extra to get it shortened. stop making fun of my red dickeys! these are my fancy , casino going to, all you can eat buffet, big pimpin  pants. used for a dance costume, not see-threw as i worried when buying. very durable and trendy, might wear these out on halloween too. ! cute, fits well. i will wear them when i can, but the large is a small large, and i just started wearing large again after 5 months of zumba, so if you wear a medium these are going to fit you good.. the length is a bit short, anyway good product cute! great now i can buy my granddaughter clothing sets, and not worry about trying to find two different sizes - one larger size for the top, and one smaller size for the pants!  you don\\'t need belt loops, either, which is great!      they work really great, no more saggy britches.  it\\'s easier if you put the smartie pant on before you put the pants on your child, and so far i\\'ve had no problem with the sp staying put! my grundens are exactly as described on amazon. they are nicely done, great color, and perfect sizing and lenth. i was surprised when they arrived sooner than expected.  they were so nicely packed. i can\\'t wait to go fishing so i  can wear them. yayyyy<br />thank you  for making my shopping experience easy and pleasant.<br />gina very cool wear i\\'ve been wearing several different pairs in solid colors of 65/35 poly-cotton tru-spec pants daily for almost ten years; the same pairs.  i haven\\'t noticed any fading on any of the colors except the black pair is now slightly lighter.  i do wash them exclusively in cold water though.  no holes, tears or rips on any of the exteriors.  i had to repair one hole in the pocket of the khaki pair and that was probably due to the massive key ring i used to carry.  these pants cannot be beat.  they\\'re cool in the summer, decent in the winter (but i usually wear coolmax leggings if its cold out).  i wear them casual with boots and t-shirts or a little dressy.  i\\'m 5\\'7\\\\\\\\\" and got medium regular; same size i wore in my work bdus (i\\'m in the air force).  they have the blousing ties built in at the bottom; you can rip them out but i roll the cuff just slightly to cover them and like the look (plus it doesn\\'t drag on the ground).  all of my pairs are \\\\\\\\\"made in the usa\\\\\\\\\" of us made materials; i don\\'t know if these still are.  some other brands have their bdus made of us fabric but  sewn in the dominican republic.  i\\'ll try to find out and amend my review.  i\\'ve been quite pleased with these pants over the years and wonder if i\\'ll ever need to buy another pair!  maybe if they came out with more colors? ok after reading the reviews i almost canceled my order. i am so glad i did not. i love these!  i would order a different color if i needed another pair. fabulous!!! these pants are supper soft and comfy. they also have nice sized pockets, which is awesome! slightly too long, but i can easily fix that myself. note:<br />if you have a very big thighs or if your weight is on your thighs then these pants will fit a bit close.<br />i am 5\\'3&#34; and i weigh 175. i am overweight and all my fat is on my butt and thighs. my waist is small and so the pants fit perfectly but it looks misshapen  and doesn\\'t hang like the pants should  because my thighs and butt area where practically squeezing out of it. i ordered these in white to bring with me to mexico and maui. they can be dressed up or down and look great with casual flip-flops, strappy sandals or wedges.<br />the bottoms dramatically flare, which is nice since the picture doesn\\'t entirely show this.<br />very cute. definitely recommend! i usually don\\'t write reviews, but this hat is a keeper.  so soft too:)  it looked to big for my 4 month old but when i put it on m i realized it fits perfectly and has a nice stretch so it seems it will fit for the full 12 months. love, love, love these. i am ordering another pair! they fit great and they are comfy. they can be dressy or casual, just what i was looking for! only pants i need for everything!! love em n price is right !! i\\'m 5\\'2\\\\\\\\\" and 130lbs. i ordered the medium size, and they are true to fit. a tad bunchy at the ankles, but easily hemmed if i decide i need to. i\\'ve been wearing these with boots, and they look fantastic. plus, no bulk in the front so blouses and shirts hang smoothly. they held up great in the wash as well. i\\'ll be buying these again. these pants are so comfortable, the best ones i have found so far. these are worth buying. they fit good. they are great for work. i like how the part that goes over the belly is stretchy and soft. a must have in the maternity wardrobe. for the price of $12.99 these pants are awesome! they hold up well to my weekly wear. very stretchy and comfortable. wife watches this show, so bought her some comfy pants to watch it in. i previously bought this item in medium. the waist fit fine but the space within the legs was too large for me and wouldn\\'t work. i\\'ve got the small size now and it fits the way it\\'s supposed to. my waist is around a 30 and length is 34, so the small worked well and needs a bit of trimming at the bottom but that isn\\'t as bad as having large spaces within the legs. very comfortable and light pants. are a size too big. broke it trying to go from38to42 exactly what i wanted, size,color,style. i love these pants but the run huge! i am sending for a medium and i hope they fit because they are so cute i love the style. this is a really nice sweat suit.  the pants are excellent with pockets both in the front and back.  i plan to order more! these pants are similar to military issued bdu\\'s; however, they are a different material that is relatively thin. overall these are a good buy for what i was comparing was the 5.11 brand pants which are a bit more money bag that has ample space with easy to access side pocket. very stylish and all my friends are envious of me. it is a must for any ladies closet! these pants are such a pretty pastel color.  it\\'s easy to find a long or short-sleeved tee shirt to go with them.  they are the right weight and they wash like a dream.  i love them! this product is awesome. i rate it five stars since im naturally think on lower body area it fits just right. no sliding down when i squat or go for a run. excellent conditions.<br />exactly what i expected. fun gift . much appreciated, especially during this extreme cold winter. good length, nice color, soft & comfortable. good value. girlfriend loved it.  must have for any little mermaid fan. good quality, u can wash in machine a it looks good absolutely love this 3 piece outfit.  perfect for cruising formal night. these fit very snug, saying it fits through a medium size may be a stretch, pun intended. my girlfriend is very thin, usually wears a small, and these were second skin on her. my wife loves these pants. they fit her well even with her wider then usual hips for a small size. the materal is really nice too. of course i like the way they look too. good quality these with the plastic pants are a must for potty training!  item as described and look like what they do in the pictures. didn\\'t realize they were elastic waist. love the pants--they are super cute and super comfy. a little on the thin side but i wasn\\'t expecting top shelf quality anyway, my husband and 24 year old son both loved these - casual but cool and comfortable.  they are 34&#34; and 36&#34; pants wearers and the meldium fit perfectly. love em i just got mine yesterday and it only came in three days from ordering which i as really surprised.i got the black yoga pants in a size small since i\\'m only 5ft tall. they are a little long since i\\'m so short but you can just fold the bottom up. these are now my new favorite yoga pants. i will be ordering more definitely in other colors! perfect to go to the beach. its a see through tho. also, it was a bit long for me. but perfect for what i need it. the quality of this legging is awesome! i ordered a medium and it was a little big around the hips area so i guess it runs a little big. i\\'m 5\\'2 athletic build. exactly what i was expecting - they are light weight and not see-through.  i\\'m normally a size small but after reading the reviews, i went with a medium and glad i did.  they fit but not too tight and they don\\'t fall down. these are great, i love them.  i\\'ve been using them for several weeks now while living out in the country.  i use them for swimming, biking and yoga. i love them, there very soft and comfy. out of all the different brands and styles of pants my baby has, these are by far my favorite ones to put her in! the best thing about these is how soft they are. makes all her other pants seems scratchy in comparison! not to mention they are adorable and easy to match, and the little pocket just adds the cutest finishing touch! they do run large, but that\\'s no biggie for me. i want these pants in adult size! highly recommend, especially for the great price! the product has great quality and those pants are so cute that my niece looks like a doll i love these!!!! they are very soft and fit so perfectly! i love that they have an inside liner that makes it feesable to wear whatever undergarments i want with out a certian patteren showing through. i absolutely love everything about these pants. super cute, comfy and a great look! just received my pants yesterday, and immediately tried them on.  wow ... another winner! i always wonder about buying clothing on line and getting the correct sizing, but i lucked out. these are very comfortable pants ... and black is a color which can take an outfit form casual to dressy in an instant. these really work for me!  slimming pants have assisted in weight loss from a 14 to a 12, and now a 10!  i bought the more expensive brand the first time, but they work so well that i don\\'t want to pay that much for something used for such a short period of time. just perfect and i love it will wear everyday and show off to everyone that asks, plan on ordering more... these are my favorite summer pants!  the material is silky and stretchy and conforms kindly to a less-than-perfect body type.  great for travel, as they don\\'t wrinkle.  they wash up great and last many years.  i\\'m always on the lookout for this product so that i can stock up when they are on sale. fun pants to wear around the house and very comfortable. perfect excellent i love these pants!  i bought them for myself and wanted something different from woodland camo or bdu.  knowing this is the pattern from vietnam i am confident that i can lay in a swamp and never been seen.  bonus!!!! however, here in northern minnesota, i will not be laying in any swamps anytime soon so i will just be happy with a comfy pair of utility pants.  these are exactly what i was looking for, i didn\\'t want jeans with a camo print, i wanted button fly fatigues with a reinforced seat...i got them.  i am so pleased with the purchase.  they fit a bit bigger than i anticipated but that could be due to recent weight loss and my misconception of garment size, but the adjustable waist tabs handled that for me perfectly!  soft, durable fabric...they washed well, too.  thank you! great pants, very innovative stretch panels that are great if you need that extra bit of room for concealed carry but do not feel like ordering pants 2 sizes bigger. great quality and stylish without looking all tactical for everyday use. sizes run true, i used my jeans size and they fit perfect. fabric was nice and soft. i think i ordered the wrong size. i returned because the style just did not work for me at all but i would recommend these to someone else for sure.  i am 5\\'7&#34; and 175lbs, i maybe could have made them work if i got a smaller size. these are really good for helping your toddler become more aware of when they are wet. that\\'s what i used them for, along with plastic pants. our daughter was able to wear these pants around two months and will be able to keep wearing them beyond three months due to the adjustable cuff.  soft and roomy and we could use these easily over onesies for some added warmth! my wife says most comfortable yoga pants she has good quality great for someone whos disturbed!!! a little baggy but i love the dogs i have purchased 4 of these pants and they are very comfortable.  they look nice too and have washed them and they came out looking nice after their first wash.  i will be looking for capris and shorts in this style when spring and summer come next year. soft and comfy, these are her favorite pj bottoms now! cozy and sweet looking i bought these for my daughter. she loved it. she\\'s 5\\' 5 ish just right weight. love them! super comfy! better than i expected; love the material as i\\'m in england i have to get them via ebay, but i love them-m1\\'s give that baggy legged, wartime look-i also have some m2\\'s for a more regular cut-i use the m2\\'s for work/weddings etc...interestingly i owned a pair of genuine new old stock fifties us military khakis a few years back- bills\\' compare favourably in my opinion-a statement that will no doubt rile the purists- it is easy to idealise vintage gear-the fifties pants were inferior in many ways (faded quicker,were not pre shrunk,and the fly construction crude and wasteful of material..bills khakis give you the best of both worlds-nice heavy cotton, same vintage look, superior around the fly.buy a pair-you get what you pay for. the pants do not look like the picture they\\'re a little faded but i still love them anyway and great material very comfortable i\\'m 5\\'4 about 145 pounds and they fit perfectly but i wore them once and didn\\'t even get to wash them i contacted the seller to exchange them insted they said returns are to expensive and only refunded me 5$ when i paid 10$ the pants are very comfortable, but they run a little short, even for a petite cut. adorable onsie that we received many compliments on throughout the night.  easy to feed and change baby this cute outfit and super soft and comfy! i love these they are so comfortable. i am 5\\'1&#34; and 108 lbs so its hard to find good pants but these are worth it! comfortable and easy to wear. ordering more of these.  i have two pair and they are so comfortable!  love them! their awesome, great quality and fit. love them great perfect fit, good quality. never had yoga pants before, but these are super comfy.  they\\'re not see-through, which is a nice bonus.  they were very long in the leg though, i had to hem them up so i wasn\\'t tripping over them. they are not the thickest one you can find but so pretty. i love the soft fabric! good pants for the money super cute pants.  very comfy.  material is somewhat cheap, but they are $25...i didn\\'t have a problem with the length, but i am only 5\\'2\\\\\\\\\".  i am 4 mos pregnant and only weigh 113 and the small was pretty small...not going to fit for very long!  pretty thin, so they may not keep me too warm this winter, but they are adorable.  curious how the other colors look in person; will have to order medium next time! fine product. i purchased this item in hopes to stretch my jeans in the waist area.  i don\\'t like tight fitting jeans.  i used this stretcher one time and it broke.  it just snapped.  i\\'ve tried to contact the company and i did not get a response, what  a disappointment!!  i was willing to try the product one more time if they would have replaced it.<br /><br />eta:  i contacted the company and they immediately rushed another stretcher out to me.  i was also given advice to not over tighten or it will break.  i will be more careful the next time i use it  +++ the pattern is not clear. but the design was cool i purchased these pants for my elderly father who served at iwo jima during wwii.  he is very hard to buy for--he lives in a nursing facility and spends a lot of time reclining or in bed.  these pants were a great hit with him.  he spent christmas day in his new \\\\\\\\\"navy\\\\\\\\\" pants with a smile across his face. these are nice for wearing around the house or to pilates class.  i usually wear a  10 or 12 and large fits good.  i\\'m 5\\'8 and these are a tad long. i got these for my teenage daughter.  she loves transformers.  she\\'s 5\\'10&#34;.  they fit perfect and are the perfect length.  she loves them. i really enjoy this product. they fit great and come in a variety of fun colors. i got a pair in every color! great yoga pants for a great price really comfortable!! lovery them!! this pants are just what i needed to wear around the house and farm.  the inseam was a bit longer than i had expected, but my wonderfully talented wife was able to take the legs up three inches.  the pants are comfortable with roomy pockets. i just tried it on and it is very confortable which is what i was looking for these are a cute color and are unisex, but they are much to big for our average size newborn, i\\'m sure they will fit appropriately before 3 months but keep in mind that you may not be able to use them in the first few weeks. i like full elastic waist pants with draw string. therefore i don\\'t have to keep tying my pants or worry about heavy items in pockets pulling them down. the fabric is heavy and keeps it color. even after several washes it does not shrink and only fades a little. it\\'s a good sturdy pant with good length. they are roomy in the hips and thighs area, but not too big. however, the stitching around the waist is unraveling. i found the same problem with the tops for this brand. for this price under $15, it\\'s a great buy. however, the shipping fee for this seller is more expensive than most. i may still consider to purchase because of the comfort of this pant. the fit is perfect.  i love the fabric and they way they look.  exactly what i was looking for. thank you. great seller.  item exactly as described.  in my last review, i make a mistake in saying that the size was wrong.  sorry likemary london.  so 5 stars it is!!!! i bought these at my local walmart. its about the same price so, do whichever you prefer. (but they only had black and khaki at wm)<br /><br />i\\'m a female, i couldnt find any pants in the womens section that i liked, they had to be black, for work. and i remember being really envious of my husband\\'s dickies.<br /><br />i really like these pants. they\\'re pretty comfortable, except the pockets are made out of stiff canvas. i\\'m hoping it goes away with washing them. also the 19\\\\\\\\\" leg i\\'m not too fond of. i\\'m used to my pant legs going over my shoes. i\\'ll probably just cut a little slit in them to rectify that issue. awesome fit! luv it! nice!! oh. my. lord. these pants are the best! do not hesitate, buy a gazillion because they are fabulous! i am 5\\'9\\\\\\\\\" and am 6 months pregnant right now. i weigh about 153 and my hips are 41\\\\\\\\\". it is hard to find pants that flatter, especially being pregnant, and these definitely do the trick. i can\\'t say enough good things about them, they are super comfortable and easily accommodate my growing belly. i can wear them to work out or sleep but they are still dressy enough to layer with a collared shirt. i am not typically one to spend much on clothes but these are well worth the price. awesome.  color is bright and pants are comfy, like pajamas. love these!  they fit just right, true to size.  i am 5\\'4&#34; and i wear a medium and they are just the right length on me.  i have tried yoga pants and they were always to long, or too loose but these are stretchy and well worth the money! fun to ware! i found the bright teal pants in nordstrom rack about a year ago, and i have coveted them ever since! one problem i\\'ve found is that the pants have a problem with pilling on the outer surface, possibly because the inner layer seems to be a natural fiber, while the outer layer of the pants is a synthetic fabric. i also found the drawstring to be absurd, the little shiny ribbon did nothing for the pants and fell out soon after washing. i use these mostly for lounge wear, and my boyfriend likes them best from all my other shleppy clothes. :) i ordered up a size for my daughter and i\\'m sure glad i did.  she\\'s 4 months old, 18lbs 1oz, and 26&#34; long.  the 6-12 months size is tight.  yes, i know it\\'s recommended to wear the jammies tight these days, but this is a pulling-at-the-buttons kind of tight.  it did loosen up after a while - i have attached a picture of her in her outfit about an hour after putting it on.<br />the outfit is well made.  the material is slinky and on the cool side, definitely not typical winter pajamas unless you keep your house really warm.  she did really enjoy the footless aspect - most of her pjs are footed and this kickee pants coverall gave her a chance to goof around with her toes a bunch in the crib each morning.<br />overall, i\\'d advise ordering up, way up in size if you have a larger baby.  these would be great in a warmer environment or during the moderate seasons of spring and fall. thankfully these were nice thick sweats with very deep pockets which i like in pants.  keeps me very warm in this winter season. good this pant is perfect for yoga and my adult ballet class. i have tried several danskin pants, and while they are nice, they cannot compare to this yoga pant. it is soft and light-weight. they breathe wonderfully during a difficult workout. the pink color does show sweat, but it is a nice color option for a workout pant. i love this yoga pant. it is wonderful, and you will not be disappointed. the company shipped the item quickly, and it arrived in good condition. the cropped pant is true to size, but it is clingy (like all yoga pants). :) :) very good fit, true size...  true color, breeze fabric, you will need nude color underware... thanks for reading, nice day as before with amazon, delivery was very prompt. pants fit very well. be sure to follow washing label since they do shed a bit. i would definitely buy another pair. was hoping for a jersey knit material but it is more of a shiny material.  regardless, they are the fit i wanted, super comfy, and able to pull the fold over top over my baby belly.  perfect! and very fast shipping. thanks. a little long for my 5\\' 2&#34; but i love love love these have ordered 3 more different styles!!<br />have had so many compliments nice quality and great fit. the color looks better in person than online!!! these are comfortable, snug, light, and will work perfectly under short skirts and dresses. we love these so much! i highly recommend them for any age. we wear as pjs and play clothes around the house. my grandsopn has down syndrome and still wears training pants. these were founsd by his mother in germany, and she could not purchase there, so called and asked me to purchase here. she started using this product several years ago, and believes they are the best made and hold up to regular washing. basically they last and last.<br /><br />just wish they had a larger size to keep up with grandson\\'s growth! i ordered one pair just to see what they was like. they came on time and are not cheaply made. we love them and will be buying another pair. they fit great and look great, very comfy. these are so comfy!!! i feel like i\\'m wearing pajamas. super soft and flowy. they also help hide my belly support belt nice pants. back pocket button broke off after one wear. fits well and nice and soft amazing pants! i started off with only 2 pairs, but i already ordered few more. i\\'m usually size 3, so i ordered small. as it turned out, they did not fit properly (they were just a bit too big). i contacted the seller for a refund while i ordered the xs. she was very helpful and sent me the right sizes right away. they fit great - i don\\'t think i ever had pants that fit me so well! usually skinny jeans flatten your butt, but these actually embrace your curves! (i\\'m small so my butt tends to disappear completely when i wear skinny jeans. but not in this case!!) i was very happy with the results and all the complements that i have been getting.<br />the price is very good, too!<br /><br />pros:<br />- they really do make your butt pop and make it more noticeable<br />- the fabric is very good quality<br />- very comfortable but at the same time tight enough to show your curves<br />- you will feel more confident with all the complements you\\'ll be getting<br />- great price<br />- the seller will help you out with whatever you need! she answers emails very quickly.<br /><br />cons:<br />- none!!!<br /><br />about the seller:<br />- answers emails very quickly<br />- makes returns/exchanges easy and fast<br />- cares about the seller\\'s satisfaction<br />- very helpful i was rather concerned ordering these if they would fit on a woman rather than the size 00 model but i was pleasantly surprised when they arrived and fit.  they were a little snug at first but loosened up. also they don\\'t come in the matte black that theyes appear as in t he picture. they are more of a gray/blue. still just as cool and they are very cool! i love these jammy pants! very comfy, nice fit. i like to have unique around-the-house loungewear, and the walking dead is a favorite topic of mine so these fit the bill. i am about 5&#34;7\\' (170 cm) and weigh about 120 lb. the small fits me perfectly. at the beginning it was tight, after a few weeks it fits perfectly. i tried the medium too, i thought it was fantastic but the day after it looked like i lost 10 lb. overnight. bottom line: they stretch.<br />but they also stain. please wash them many times before using them. my housekeeper said that if you put them in the freezer for 48 hours before washing them the first time they won\\'t stain and won\\'t change shape. not sure if this is an urban legend or housekeeper wisdom. i\\'ll see with the black ones i ordered (after the tailor will make the waist smaller because the black ones were a medium).<br />the blue ones are great and i am wearing them every day. (i bought a couple. i wear one while the other one is in the wash). they faded a lot, but i don\\'t care, some people may even like the &#34;faded look&#34;. i just don\\'t care because i have four children and having extra pockets is a blessing (why i have never thought of it in 8 years?). i can put my phone, my car keys, the flash cards i am studying, or tissues. it\\'s awesome.<br /><br />i recommend them. well made, i always wash in delicate - have worn/washed three times, holding up well. i wear a 32&#34; waist, i ordered a large, they fit fine. great,  but too big these leggings were very good quality and i love the colors. they are put together well and i\\'m sure will stand up for many wearings with my daughter! the gerber training pants are the most reliable means for potty training.  however, size 18 months for my tiny daughter was impossible to find in the stores.  thanks amazon for carrying the smaller sizes when i need \\'em! i like these pants.  the materials is thick but breathes well.  length on the small was short (i\\'m 5\\' 5.75&#34;) and that felt odd due to the snug fit so i got the mediums and liked the fit better.  if the smalls were an inch longer, the fit would have been perfect but i couldn\\'t bend my knees without feeling a pull at the waist or ankle due to very snug ankles.  maybe i just have fat ankles and everyone else would be fine :)  i wear a size 10 pants normally.  these don\\'t fit baggy on me, which is how i prefer so that i can wear them under things if need be.  material washes well.  i got them in the off white and dark blue. attractive pants, fit well. super soft fabric, exactly what i wanted, except for the small elastic band at the top. i expected a wider band, but still love them. these trousers are a good fit, but the olive colour is more brown than olive. the service provided by the seller was excellent! fit great and seem ok, have not worn them, just tried them on, cool looking can\\'t wait to wear them out i am 5\\'6 125 pounds and i purchased a size 7 in these. they fit perfect the color was great, nice deep olive and pants were thick. these are pull-on stretch pants with pockets and a faux zipper placket.  they\\'re comfortable, and held their shape for an 8 hour drive.  i wore them on vacation and didn\\'t feel like a schlumpy tourist.<br /><br />i\\'m losing weight and transitioning between sizes fairly quickly - these were more than worth the price and i\\'ll be checking into other wallflower products.<br /><br />edited to add:  at 5\\'8\\\\\\\\\" and 220 lbs these were a perfect fit - long enough to cover my ankles without being too long, and looked great with my faux-toms.  at 214 lbs they are starting to be a little loose, but still look nice and will be wearable for another 5 lbs or so. my son still wears them, they are so comfortable, soft. you can throw in washer, doesn\\'t stretch or shrink. we love them when my baby came home from the hospital, these were a little long but now the baby wears them as capris. they last a long time & i\\'m glad i bought them. these are really cute!  the only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars were they are very see-through at the top.  i was expecting it to be thicker and more like leggings.  i love the pattern though! price high a little fit well the hot slimming pants is pirfekt pants. i like them. absolutely amazing! gorgeous trousers which hug your curves and push your stomach in, making you look ten times sexier! they also make your legs appear longer, and the gold zips are a beautiful edition. i wore them with a cute black tank top, gold bracelets and a gold necklace, and got tons of compliments :) i really recommend them, they are a gorgeous edition to your wardrobe. i\\'m not sure why bit the phrase &#34;gym legging&#34; made me think these would be a little looser than regular leggings. they are still pretty tight, and only slightly looser around the ankle (which the picture doesn\\'t show very well). the tightness doesn\\'t bother me at all. still very much like these leggings, but just so you know, the ankle is kind of more of a &#34;boot cut&#34; than a traditional legging opening. i love these pants.  they\\'re long enough, they fit just right through the calf.  construction is good. my only issue - and it\\'s a minor one - is that i\\'m going to have to take in the waist. these pants are extremely comfortable and looks cute.  i don\\'t like tight fitting clothes (what\\'s a girl to do with todays fashions); and, these pants are snug. so i wear them with a long sweater.  adorable! i read reviews for many different fleece lined legging and opted for these because they had the lease amount of &#34;odor&#34; complaints. there is a slight chemically smell but not overwhelming. not quite warm enough to wear in the midwest in december. but i layered them under my cotton leggings and was toasty warm. it was a gift my son love this nice sexy pants, worth the money. comfortable yoga pant. everybody loves them want know where she got them from. no problems.  arrived on time and at the level of quality expected i bought these for my wife, who is a huge bon jovi fan.  they were a little bigger than i thought, but they are very comfortable and warm.  she has worn and washed them several times and unlike some pajama pants, these have held up well. i like the denim look leggings, which i find very convenient when in a rush. but be advise they are a little big up top and high above the belly button. in fact my pregnant sister loves them, she say they have a perfect fit for her cute and comfy. plain and simple! a must have for your  gym class wardrobe at a wonderful price. i give them two thumbs up. love it love these pants - they\\'re supre comfy and basically a pant jegging. i think they\\'ll look great with a tunic top and short boots for fall! well fitting (us size 4-6) and comfortable.  the leopard patterning and fabric is loose from the pants (attached only along one edge) so that you can use it to disguise/hide any belly excess...works surprisingly well. bought these for my daughter who lives at a distance.  she absolutely loves them.  i got to see her in them and she looks darling.  sizing was true to norm and the style was better than i could even tell in the picture.  speed of delivery was more than acceptable. this is my third pair of pants. i love them, they are super soft and roomy. one of my best investments. they work great and are comfy for my baby,a little roomy, but great fit for great price. these cargo pants fit great!!  i like all of  the velcrowe pockets too. more than i wanted to pay but still happy!! absolutely love these! the fabric is amazing, so soft! they wash great too! my 2 year old granddaughter is really into mickey mouse so i got these pj bottoms for my daughter for christmas. i really like the quality and the print. i love that these are organic cotton and i got them on a super deal for about $5. but the sizing is off for my little girl. she\\'s about 6 months now and they\\'re still too big on her. her height is 25&#34;. no big deal since i\\'ll just save them for later, but a heads up if you\\'re thinking about buying them. received order quickly, and as expected loved do these pants i bought four pairs to wear under my skirts while cycling.  though they are fairly thin material, they have worked wonderfully thus far.  these are longer than boyshorts, but shorter than your typical \\\\\\\\\"bike shorts,\\\\\\\\\" which keeps them hidden under even fairly short skirts.    the material is thin, i did get a run in one pair and i wouldn\\'t wear them on their own.  regardless, though, as long as i wash them on gentle and hang dry, i think they will last.  great shorts for under $5! this one fit just right omg!!! the cutest yoga pants i have ever witnessed!!! love their products!! fit great, i\\'m 5\\'7 and looooong legged and they\\'re perfect!!!! decent quality material. perfect size for me and the length is just nice, the material is comfortable to wear,i really love this pants. i bought this belt as a gift for my teen daughter. the quality is exceptional and i wouldn\\'t hesitate purchasing another again. wife likes them but she says they run small and fit very tight! so comfortable i love them! these shorts are fantastic. they don\\'t squeeze in the wrong places like some tight shorts do! very breathable, comfortable to wear, and fit nicely. i\\'m 5\\'9\\\\\\\\\" and around 130 and had no problem fitting these. :) i would absolutely recommend these to a friend. the material is great and it keeps its shape. best yoga pant i have ever had. they do run a little long the weight of the linen makes them drape nicely.  nice fit. he loved them. i\\'m not too worried about sizing and fit, if everyone is anatomically proportional then one size up will do if you decide to order them.<br /><br />they\\'re good work pants for any outside career, like contractors or technicians.<br />they\\'re just a bit thicker than your average jeans or cargo pants you find at wal-mart and other retailers,  so unless you\\'re fighting jaguar and puma these will be hard to tear.<br /><br />the knees are extra pleated for rugged use and the pockets are spacious for hiking trips, ammo carrying, etc.<br /><br />these may be more favorable to wear in the cooler months,  but as work pants,  these really help a plumber in the sense or prolonged use.<br /><br />if you\\'re looking for a more modular design, check out 5.11 tactical\\'s pants. most perfect pajama pants ever...and very clever and fun! arrived pretty fast. fit pretty good they are stretch material so it is okay!! color is perfect no fading!!! bought xs for wife 5\\'-1&#34; fits yummy.  um.. there is nothing more to say but thanks kalon clothing yoga pants pants fit is perfect. they look good. length is great. they arrived on time. would buy them again. very cute and comfy. beautiful color. good for yoga / workouts.  but only 4 stars because they stretch a lot pretty fast... [[asin:b0016j18yq inc international concepts linen pants]]    unbelievable quality for the price.  would expect to pay at least twice as much for similar pants locally.  the fabric is rich and soft.  bought them for my teenage son and he\\'s picky and loves them.  they are machine washable though the label says \\\\\\\\\"dry clean\\\\\\\\\", and that\\'s a good thing! only drawback is that the drawstring is on the inside of the garment instead of the outside so when the pants are belted the drawstring knot is annoying.  this is not a problem if your shirt is worn out without a belt. excellant pants, hold up to the wyoming winter. i bought these as a gift for my niece that just moved to wyoming from washington state. she thought washington was cold! good for what i wanted.i elastic waist.  not the thickest pants, but still good especially for the price. sin comentarios negativos, el articulo lleno mis expectativas y es tal cual se describe en la publicacion. la entrega fue a tiempo. disclaimer: idk how the shipping and whatnot goes. i bought mine from the actual hottopic store.<br /><br />they\\'re like standard pajama pants. the legs were a bit long on me, but i don\\'t really mind. they aren\\'t necessarily the warmest of pants, but they\\'ll do fine just for indoor use. i wouldn\\'t recommend going outside in them when it\\'s really cold out.<br /><br />i\\'d give them a 9.5/10 four-and-a-half stars, actually...i absolutely love these pants; they are so warm and comfortable and still look great after lots of wearing and washing. even the rose on the leg looks like new. these fairly inexpensive pants even outshine my cashmere ones. (note that the cashmere ones i have are neiman marcus and were originally $300--though i got them at a yard sale brand new for $2. ;) these are softer and warmer and i can wash them in the washing machine without worrying about ruining them. that\\'s always a plus. the only reason i am not giving them 5 stars is because they don\\'t have pockets!  so nowhere to put my cell and keys...drives me insane. soft and comfy. made for a man, but fits me fine. washed well. my daughter wears these every night to sleep.  they fit great, and are a little big which allows room to grow.  the material is soft and flexible, very high quality.  my daughter hates stuff going on and off over her head, so the kimono design works great! love these! very comfortable will buy more. i wear  size 7 i ordered a sm/med soft and well made but they are definitely a size bigger than stated. i love the gender neutral colors they are easily matched with other things. these pants are soft and hold up well in washings. my daughter loves them. we wish they had some big baggy shirts in this fabric too!! fit great! the print is blurry, but they still look good. perfect for my son\\'s spongebob party. little long - but my friend is short the material is extremely thin, almost too thin. satisfied nonetheless. the material is light weight and not warm enough for the cold winter months. excellent pants for the price.  the first time i tried them on, one of the two closure snaps fell off.  i replaced the snap with one out of a repair kit i happened to have.  the repair snap was silver and did not match the black one that fell off, but it didn\\'t matter as i did not buy these pants for style, but function.  after i made the repair, i found that they had a replacement snap kit included with the pants in one of the pockets.  apparently, that is a common problem.<br />after this repair, the pants are performing well.  ( i got the correct size on the first try because i went to a retail vendor to try them on before i ordered. ) solid, very good quality, very well made, exact measure and wearing pleasure...<br /><br />heavy duty ripstop material blend, nir compliant, a flame-resistant, absorbs and evaporates perspiration faster, older cammo pattern, but still very good pants<br /><br />highly recommend it, if you are not too crazy about overpriced $140 multicam fr pants i love it! it fits perfectly and it\\'s a decent price. i would definitely buy another set in a different color. fit very well. comfortable. would definitely purchase again. good quality but way too small. i usually wear a medium but ordered a large due to the other reviews. but even the large were too small they are too small for me, i need biger size, but i don\\'t know what size is good for me, l or xl  . i don\\'t know what to do got a pair of these for my 22 yar old daughters birthday...and am very happy. they fit her comfortably without binding at the waist, and they actually fooled a few people into thinking they were a pair of jeans.the fit was great, and even though i am a couple sizes larger than her, im quite sure they would fit me as well, and i plan on buying a few pairs of a different style for myself. wonderful product, and my daughter is thrilled with them.....as am i!! love them fabulous leggings!!! this is my 2nd pair and am quite happy with them. the price is good and so far no problems, the fit is nice and looks really good. these pants are a canvas-like material which is lightweight and doesn\\'t chafe. many pockets make these essential &#34;battle&#34; gear. these would go well with a combat windbreaker and black cotton athletic shirt or tee shirt with mandatory black boots and black cap. this was too large and had to size down to large. i love these pants and i love the way they fit for the most part (being 22 weeks pregnant) however i am 5\\'9&#34; and they are a little short..i rolled them up a cuff and it doesn\\'t look too bad; luckily the weather will be colder soon and i can wear them with boots. overall, i am satisfied with the product. great fit. comfortable  do a lot of kneeling and bending at my job. these were just what i was looking for perfect gift these pants are very comfortable.  the material is very soft and thick enough to hide flaws.  i took one star off due to the length.  i\\'m only 5\\'4.  so, i am used to pants being a little on the long side, but these are almost ridiculously long. there is about an extra 4-5 inches or so of material dragging the ground.  i just got them to lounge around in, so i don\\'t mind rolling them.  i was surprised to find that they were so long given some of the other reviews that mentioned they were good for shorties.  not sure if they changed the style or if there is just inconsistency with the length, but i got 2 pairs and both were very long. they are very nice jeans. my daughter looks great in them. had to get leggings for my daughter\\'s tap routine. i knew she\\'d wear them once,so these were great for the price.  they aren\\'t cheap looking either. i\\'m very happy with the purchase the foot straps are a little long but i\\'m also short. size small for 5\\'7&#34;. everything else fits amazing, highly recommended. very comfortable, however a bit long on me  (i am 5\\'5\\\\\\\\\" tall and these are about an inch to 1 1/2\\\\\\\\\" too long) but i still like them enough to keep them and work out in them after i put on my tennis shoes it gives me just enough height for this to not drag the groumd.  i would love for the sellers to make these types of pants in length sizes for us gals who do not have the height and length in our legs for all typses of fashion.  thank you i ordered my first pair of these pants almost two years ago (i bought the charcoal colored). these have, hands down, become my favorite pants for lounging-around in the cooler seasons. i work from home and wear these pants most often (when they\\'re not in the wash). finally, after two years i ordered another pair in the pink color. my first pair is still in great condition and has fit me comfortably even after gaining a little weight since i bought them -- and they still fit comfortably! i love these pants! these pajama pants are very soft and of good quality. they seem to run large. i purchased them for my daughters and they are very pleased. my kid loved it from the first day. like the sleeves on the hoodie are a bit short but i still love it and it looks amazing :) these are high quality walking trousers.<br />montane are very nice outdoor clothing and equipment and very lightweight.<br /><br />i have these in the taupe colour, and am very happy with them.<br />they are very light weight, pack down to such a small size, are made of a very nice high wicking lateral which is quick drying and very high quality.<br />the material is summer weight, ideal for hot or warm weather as they fit beautifully, look good, reflect the heat, and don\\'t get hot.<br />the fit is very good, they feature a high crotch, with a nice fit and articulated knees, and unlike other outdoor trousers, the hem is perfect and slightly tapers, and can be worn over boots or trainers without looking like mc hammer or john travolta.<br />the hem also features button fasteners so you can make it tighter, or tighten and roll up to form 3/4 .<br /><br />the waist is part elasticated and lined with a soft material - very very comfortable, and features a clip on removable belt.<br /><br />the trousers have a thigh picket/vent which is zippered,along with two deep side zippered pockets one which features an inside zippered coin/money compartment.<br /><br />i am 5\\'7&#34; stocky and short and have a size 34 - 36&#34; waist and short legs (29 - 30&#34; inside leg) the large size with regular length fits great, hangs nicely, and fits great over my high trekking boots - i think a short leg would be perfect but i aint complaining.<br /><br />i think the regular leg size would suit anyone from 29-30&#34; inside leg to someone with a proper 32&#34; inside leg. the short length would be more perfect a fit for someone with 30&#34; inside leg or shorter.<br /><br />all in all, great looking trouser which i wear casually ay to day, as if not for the montane logo hey could pass for a pair of normal slacks.<br /><br />perfect for summer or hot dusty climes - i wore mine in the punjab and hindu kush in temperatures ranging up to the 80ies \\'f (or high 20ies to 30 odd \\'c) in the plains to low as 35 \\'f or approaching zero \\'c in the hindu kush and these served me well, keeping me cool when required, blocking some wind too when required and a real 2 to 3 season trouser. i love this not cheap like other clothing i have bought from prime sellers! love it....... !!! nice quality material and long enough. i bought theese for my daughter. she is 5ft 8in and usually buys longs. i was worried that they wouldn\\'t be long enough but they are perfect length and nice quality for the price. amazingly perfect! good i should\\'ve gotten a size bigger because my butt is to big for it :,( but they are good joggers but, not the best. not nearly comfy enough! very nice pants,light weight and comfortable. they run small buy a size up! they also sit very low on your waist! v perfect they fit well and are pretty absorbent. so, like liam, i have been looking for a durable, but cheep pair of phats for quite some time. all of the ones i saw with designs on them cost from $140 to $260. plus, i would have had to buy them from australia. now don\\'t get me wrong i love aussie to death and would love to support them, but i:<br />a) was on a budget, and<br />b) live in america.<br /><br />with that, i found these here and they are perfect! they may not have a fancy design, but they are very inexpensive and excellent for shuffling plus you can buy reflectors and sew them on yourself for way under $260. do note, however that they do not contain belt loops for suspenders (which i was already prepared for and aware of before buying thanks to liam). if you want to put suspenders on, you can either buy grommets, or sew on belt loops. your choice.<br /><br />overall, being one of the few lonely hardstylers in america, these were an excellent option! they create that famous \\\\\\\\\"glide illusion\\\\\\\\\" when shuffled in correctly. i recommend this to anyone who wants a good pair of phats for a good price. works well ! i bought these for my 12yr old daughter and she loves them!! says they\\'re warm and comfy!  i\\'m sure i\\'ll be borrowing them from her! i just got these and they  seem quite comfy, though i do have to keep pulling them up as someone else mentioned.  also, they are long!  i got a size 6 (the smallest) and am 5\\'3&quot; and they are full length pants on me.  that was a surprise.  actually, all of the liz lange pants i have purchased are exceptionally long for me (~6&quot;), so if you are on the short side of tall, be prepared for this! these jogger pants were super comfortable. i did order them i believe a size too big, but they still got me many compliments.<br /><br />thanks these leggings fit &#34;pretty much&#34; as expected. although one of the leg parts was more snug than the other. ny cistomer still liked them and has mentioned that the clips have held tight through a days wear. purchased for my 4 month old son. i wasn\\'t able to find black pants like these. these are a nice color and i love that they have all of the colors to choose from. thy are nice and soft and fit great. what a great pair of rain pants! so far i have used them at work in the poring rain in 40f degree temperatures & 15 to 30 m.p.h. wind, i have also used them while camping in cold wet & muddy conditions with lows of 26f degrees. in both cases no water or wind made it through, me & my base layers stayed warm & dry. i\\'m looking forward to using them in the warmer months as they are very light with no insulation.<br /> the design & quality is flawless being well laid out & no obvious short cuts taken. with zippers allow easy on & off, access to base layer pockets as well as velcro & elastic to keep wind & water out of your boots.<br /> i recommend you check the manufacturer\\'s web site for sizing, i am 5\\'8\\\\\\\\\" 150 lbs i ware 32\\\\\\\\\" x 32\\\\\\\\\" pants & i find the medium size to fit very well.<br /> i look forward to many years of use with these pants & i hope you do to. i have had a purple pair of these pants for 6 years. i love them and would recommend them to anyone. they are so comfortable and worth every penny! these are great! when you workout it really makes you sweat good snow pants. this is a great find and timely for xmas gifts, i just ordered 3 more.  made in usa, hooray!!  95% cotton!!  very comfortable at-home or yoga pants.  the pants is in junior size. fits well, fun to wear, great color.  my daughter got these haram pants for her contemporary dance class, and all the other kids thought they were great. love these pants wonderful great fit i\\'ve never worn a more comfortable and durable sleep pants - these are excellent!  they\\'re a bit expensive, but well worth the investment. this was a gift and the recipient loves it. i love them! keep in mind they shrink a bit in the wash. i\\'m 5\\'6\\'\\', 140lbs.ordered a medium and they fit me perfectly. thick enough you cant see through them which is a plus! the band at the top can be a bit flimsy but they are very comfortable summer pants, seriously thinking about buying another pair. i love love love this jumpsuit. i have 3 colors so far...the grey, black, and olive. i have received so many compliments!!! i wore one to work with a cardigan and one to a comedy show with a jean jacket. i already wrote a review but i\\'ll repeat again that i love them. i am 5-7&#34; and 145-150 lb n bought size l n am very happy with the way they fit on me. thanks! these are soft and nice. they really hold up. my son used them for a year and they still look like new. i highly recommend.<br /><br />note that these pants are training pants so they don\\'t have heavy padding. will absorb little accidents on the way to the potty which is the whole point. i already had a \\\\\\\\\"goretex\\\\\\\\\" raincoat, and it works so well my legs were getting wet, here on the rainy gulf coast. i drive a handicap access bus, and have to get out to help regardless of weather conditions. these pants will keep your legs dry. period. i\\'m 5\\'11 & a half. 145 lbs. my waist is a 28, but i ordered the small anyways, and they fit just fine. never found workout pants off the rack that fit. i ordered these pants in a small extra long & they fit like a glove. i screamed out loud with joy because they fit so well! i just received them in the mail 10 minutes ago & i\\'ve already ordered a 2nd pair! the material is complimentary, not too tight, but not too loose & very comfortable. i would highly recommend these pants. everything is great. legs are warm on upto 10f. one thing to be noted is that the color of the pants changes to black from dark blue after washing once. i love these! perfect for winter. the material is very stretchy. i usually wear size 4-6 in bottoms depending on brand.i got these in large and they fit perfect. the skirt part is super short but kinda cute so i like it. the only issue that i have is that the elastic band is very firm and digs into my waist. but those wear out after a few washes so i think it will be fine. over all great pair of cute leggings. very form fitting and sexy! it is a good product my husband is a lover of m & m\\'s and these are his favorite ...ever lounging pants! thanks for sending them in time for christmas i really enjoy this product. it keeps everything together when you workout.  i\\'ve used it during my intense work out classes and i can definitely feel that i\\'m burning extra calories with it on. just be aware that these pants will stick to your skin when you take them off because you\\'re drenched in sweat. it sorta feels like you\\'re wearing scuba pants. i\\'m not a big fan of the logo &#34;slimhot&#34; on one of my pants sleeves, so i tuck that in. overall, this product delivers what it says on its description. i\\'m a size 8 and i ordered a m. i feel after a few more workouts i\\'m going to order a size small. bought for a family member and she loves them.  cozy, warm and cute pj bottoms. my boyfriend loves my booty in it i love the pants but they are too big, medium is my size but i think they run big, i need to exchange them, how can i get the exchange? it\\'s fit perfectly and i love it. no dislike. nice pants!  very soft and comfy...  not too thick! these are great and so easy and comfortable to wear! are they the same pants in the picture? while i do love these pants the style, the fit, the look; the only problem i have is that i am very short so there is a substantial amount of extra material at the bottom and around the waist it is a little loose as well. i am 4\\'10 so i am used to extra length at the bottoms of pants, but i don\\'t think it would harm anyone to accommodate us shorter people as well as i am not skinny yet there is quite a lot of room around the mid section area. other than those the pants are extremely great, very comfortable and stylish. i should have got a smaller size i wish it would have said they were &#34;jeggings&#34; not jeans but i love them ooh ra on a great quality sweat pants i am wearing mine right now and i love them i recommend them to anyone that wants to be warm this winter i love these little pants.  they are so soft and have plenty of room in the bum area for my girl\\'s cloth diaper bulk.  if i could buy these in every color and size, i would! very comfortable and nice .<br />it loos more like leggings , and fabric is synthetic , but i like the product . the colors are expectacular, the fabric is so soft for my baby, you can use since 1 month old and they fix perfectly. rex from rex-kwon-doe said it best. do you think anyone wants a roundhouse kick to the face while i\\'m wearing these bad boys??? fugeddaboudit!!! awesome to own. the pants are great and functional . they are not meant to work wear but do help with my photography. keep me cool in tropical conditions. they can also go as some afternoon to eventing wear. these didn\\'t fit my baby until she was about 8lbs.  the feet are a little weird but these are an easy thing to throw on over a onesie to keep her warm in winter. wayyyyy smaller than chart claims. they fit my daughter perfectly however. watch out for the duty charges!!! they are huge from the uk. great !!  love the grey colors my granddaughter loved these pants! i love these leggings. i\\'m 5\\'7&#34; and they fit pretty well. the only thing that\\'s a bit loose is the ankle area and the print is only slightly blurry which isn\\'t a big deal. i would definitely buy again. love love love! i would buy again, reasonably priced for the quality and perfect for winter wear due to the fact it kept my legs warm. a cute outfit for a dressy occasion, yet more convenient for diaper changes than an actual tuxedo.  good quality too. great training pants for small accidents. i wish i could purchase more but amazon page is not working, not giving you the option to select the size/color making it impossible to add it to the cart. i might have to buy it from somewhere else. i actually use these pants for my pajama bottoms. i wear a rayon from bamboo shirt as a top, as well (texere silk is the manufacturer for the shirt). they don\\'t have any annoying hard &#34;bumps&#34; on the back of the waistband that would make it uncomfortable to sleep in. made from 70% bamboo, 20% cotton, and 10% spandex, they keep me cool at night, and i have a hunch that the added cotton will provide longer durability. the reason i took one star off was because i wish there was an adjustable cord sewn into the waistband, so that people can adjust to their particular waist size.  ----- update: 3/14/2017  these pants are still in good shape compared to my 95% rayon from bamboo shirt i ordered around the same time in 2013. the shirt has holes, while my pants do not! when these pants eventually wear out, i will definitely order another pair. these are the best pajama bottoms i have owned. i would also like to add that yes, these pants are rather loose in the waist for their size. fun pants to wear around the house. love \\'em! very comfortable too! i\\'m 5\\'3&#34;, 108 lbs and i ordered the small black pair.  i love these pants!  they feel very nice, fit very nicely.  in fact, i love them so much i ordered another pair.  they are a bit thin...but that\\'s perfect since i\\'m working out in them.  i seriously want to live in these, they are so comfy! beautiful color. very comfortable. very soft, can\\'t wait to put my baby in these once she is a bit bigger, definitely too big for a newborn, not sure how these are 0-3 months, they seem to be more like a 3 month size. i purchased these in the newborn size for my son\\'s coming home outfit.  they are made of a super soft cotton and feel like they would be so comfortable for a newborns first outfit- i wish i had some in my size in the same material!  there is also the l\\'oved baby logo very prominently across the rear of the pants. i\\'m not always a fan of wearing big logos but on these i think it looks adorable.  i will probably buy a couple more in different sizes and colors since they seem like a perfect lounge pant for the little one. i bought these because it is hard for me to fit jeans comfortably and flatteringly, and i have one pair of knit cotton pants (like a slightly thicker t-shirt fabric) that i really love and wanted in other colors. reading the reviews, i hoped that these would be similar. i followed the size guide with some hesitation (i\\'ve gained and lost weight and developed curves over the last year, and i don\\'t even know what size pants i can expect to wear anymore). the pants i received did fit, but in the way that so many new pairs of skinny or stretch jeans fit when i first bought them on a good day. in other words, i can fit into these comfortably on some days, while on others (if i\\'m bloated or just want something not too restrictive) i just prefer real jeans.yes, the fabric is soft, the color is nice, and the stretch is better than in many other pants. panty lines are a little less of an issue, and the functional fly is nice. the bottom line is that these are essentially a nice pair of jeggings, and not quite what i was looking for. great pants, cool pockets. got it for trip to europe this summer so have not yet tested the pick pockets proof-ness.  keep in mind, i choose a size bigger than i normally wear and it fits fine, but would have been too small if i choose my normal size. so comfy! great fit .. bought them to wear after i had my baby , had plenty of stretch for my postpartum body. still wearing them weeks later ! my favorite leggings ever. my son is 7 months old and still wears these pants.  the color is awkward and the don\\'t go with any thing printed. alfred dunner pants always fit exactly as expected, and are very comfortable. good anything star wars is great. these are just what i wanted. the color and fit are just as advertised on line. i wish they had more colors in my size. if you know this style and brand then i would recommend these to friends. these keep us dry as a bone!!  i got these for a friend and myself, working outside a lot, and they kept me dry and warm!  that along with the price is the trifecta i was looking for!! thanks amazom! i love these pants so much i ordered another pair. they make me wish i would have given into maternity pants a month or so ago. reasonable price too for the quality. wife loved and her ass looks awesome in em these are the most comfortable yet stylish pants ever.<br /><br />i get compliments on them all the time. i love the rhinestone on the leg. these pants can be dressed up or down. if you are looking for something different in plus size pants....these are the ones to own.<br /><br />[[asin:b0056jrgyi stretch cotton yoga pants rhinestone cross design]] these pants are da bomb.!! very good size, color chosen. adjustable exceed expectations. according to the proper use, recomendado al 100% for other persons, besides excellent runs small in size fiancee is prego! lol! but she\\'s walking in comfort thank you. loved it!! i\\'m 5\\'4 148 lbs.. fit perfect these are super fun.  i really like them and wish they were a little more roomy.  they fit me okay but i would love for them to fit like the picture (the reason for 4 stars)  the material is nice (haven\\'t wash yet).  i am a true size 16 (a plus girl) if they came in a plus one size fits all i would have given 5 stars i just received my pants ordered in petite large since i typically wear a 14 petite.  they were huge and i am returning them for a petite medium. keep this in mind when ordering these otherwise great quality pants. great pants for the price perfect fit! fitted pants with some stretch to it. wide waist band which i like & slim in the knees but still flares at the bottom. very happy with the pants. if you look at this product and don\\'t buy it then you must be a communist. don\\'t be that person, buy it and rock it everywhere. i promise you won\\'t be disappointed, and if you are then send it to me. these pants are super cute!! the shipping was fast! came 3 days after i bought the pants! i just tried them on and i don\\'t want to take them off :) love them so soft and cozy! super in love its what my daughter was looking for i live in these pants. they can be dressed up and worn for casual. nice material and easy to wash too. if you\\'re a commando kinda gal i would not wear these without undies!!!  you can see right through them.  i bought the 1x which is my normal size but they were a little bit small.  i absolutely love the color the pic does them justice! i weigh 110lbs and i\\'m 5ft 6. bought a small grey, and its perfect for me and for the price, super comfortable and soft, material is not thin or see-through. nice pockets with zips that can fit my phone. i could live in these! it could have been a bit tighter at the bottom but i pull them up anyways. gave to my boyfriend grandma as a gift pants fix but hoodie didn\\'t but not your fault it\\'s hers for being a little big on top i like red kap products, these pants look good, fit well, they are durable and have lots of pockets.  my only complaint about these pants are the front pockets could be just a little deeper or they would have gotten 5 stars. insanely comfortable!!! i would live in these if i could.<br /><br />i was a little wary of the reviews stating they fit small, but the material these came in is very stretchy and i had zero problems with a small -- i am 5ft, 115 lbs, around a size 4. the length is a little longer than i wanted (i wanted these to sit more like capris), but this is easily solved by flipping the top over. as far as the color, i love the gray, but it\\'s a little more on the casual, gym side. i just placed an order for the black to see if i can get away with dressing these up a little. all in all, very happy with this purchase! the pants are kinda balloony. wasn\\'t expecting that, but i got these mostly for wearing around the house. they look humorous, snug at waist and ankles but baggy otherwise,  but fit well and are very comfy. not close fitting like a lot of the pants they sell for babies. nice and lose for some freedom. these are great fleece cargo paints.  i rate them best on the market for the price.  excellent fit and perfect length. my only complaint is the pockets are a little small.  still i highly recommend them. all good. soft fabric. the only thing is that after a wash the fabric got little dots :( sizes.off a little.  no problem returning them i wish they still had the black and white striped ones in 12 month size. i loved these. excellent product. even though i am a size 6, i prefer the medium.  less camel toe that way.  very very lomg they fit good . these pants are great to dance in and i love that they have the tiger because it makes me feel fierce haha :) they fit great and are really comfortable! this cmai is so sexy, i ve enjoyed my wife in it!!!  it is easy to care for (wife says) and it was made to last!!!!<br />the quality of this item is excellent!!!!<br /><br />jay i love these i workout in them very stretchy and comfortable. look great on. feel great. thanks for shipping earlier than expected. these are great. love love love them very stylish and fun....<br /><br />  hallie very comfortable and stylish. the shipping was quick and well packaged. i have washed and dried them and they still look awesome. they are very stretchy and tend to be very long. i ordered the size i normally wear and they were perfect for me! i would buy them again, but one size larger. great price on a great legging, nice and warm. my bf loved it great clothing fit prefect will order again. one thing i love about using these vice &#34;pullups&#34; is that the kids hate the way they feel when they have accidents, so it causes them to be more aware and willing to go potty. my son was potty trained within 3-4 days of wearing these. really 2 days but there was a accident here and there and sometime just little pittles but other than that, i highly reccomend them for potty training and i suggest getting 2 packs just in case. at first he went through 4-5 pair a day while learning. unexpected excellence! i love these tactical pants! i had to get them in black also. i got these for my gf and they fit perfectly. they look amazing and she loves them. the color that came in is actually really nice. i love my pants.  they fit just the way i like my skinny pants to fit...i am well pleased with this product :-) these yoga pants are very comfortable and fit great. very see through, though; i will only wear these around the house. these are good quality and my daughter says the fit is perfect.  they are not too tight and they bottom covers the boot nicely. i love them!! &#60;3 great fit after cutting out the waistband string suggested by other reviewers, thanks to other reviewers the pants now fit perfectly. the waistband string makes the pants fit much tighter with no room to adjust. love the pants bought 3 pairs. easy care. i am 5\\'7 and a size medium to large in pants. i ordered these in large teal because i didn\\'t want them to be tight and unflattering. they fit perfectly! they look awesome, have enough room to move, dance, lounge, etc. i wear them to dance practice all the time. they never fall off and have the option to roll the top down or leave it up. they\\'re also super comfortable. i am very happy with this purchase! i love the care put into the packaging of this product, the fit and look we\\'re great as well. i will buy more of these for sure these are as gorgeous as the pic!!!!!!!!!!! stunning, love them!<br />my only complaint is they don\\'t come fully laced up so you have to sit there for 20 mins and do it yourself great product! arrived quickly and safely packed. thanks so much!! i purchased these for my sister during her first pregnancy. she said they fit perfectely and the were very comfortable.  she wears them to work. i love love love these pants. i have bought 4 pairs now. the material is great, great quality. nice and long. different colors are a little shorter but still very long. i had to still pin them up, which is how i like it. fit perfectly. i love these! i went with a m because i was concerned about them shrinking or fitting improperly. i should have gone with s (i am 5\\'7&#34; & 120-130lbs). after a few washes, there is no noticeable size difference. they\\'re incredibly comfortable and i would buy another pair in a heartbeat. super comfortable, warm in cold weather, but also able to wear a small fleece layers underneath. love \\'em!! i bought these pants for work. they are very comfortable when new, and as they are broken in, they become very soft. they are also very durable. they only thing that i marked them down is that the color isn\\'t the traditional khaki color. for work purposes, i will only wear dickies. my daughter loves them durable i love that they\\'re not see through. they fit great and i received them waaay earlier than the estimated delivery date so that was a big plus! i\\'m actually surprised at how well i took to these pants/ jumper. this is far from my style of clothing but i purchased it for an upcoming trip in which \\'modest\\' type pants are required. before the trip i wore the item as a jumper to a barbecue and just to do errands. women were stopping me on the streets etc to shower me with compliments. and you know we women can be tough on each other.  anyway i use an american size 12/14 and jumper fit perfectly with no slippage. purchase with confidence...i hope this style of jumper will eventually come in brighter colors great product thought these pants were made well - the material is so soft and comfortable - but boy do they run small. i normally wear a 6 or 8 and had to send the &#34;med&#34; back. i like my pants a bit snug but i don\\'t need everyone to see every ripple :(  anyway - i ended up turning around and buying 3 pair in large..can\\'t wait till they get here!! i purchased them for wearing around home instead of getting caught in my pj\\'s all the time! exactly what i wanted so happy :) !!! i put these on immediately...i was impressed with the softness of the fabric-felt smooth to put on. i love them.<br />i wore them the entire evening at home and they were so comfortable and i am very glad i bought them! so fun!  they run really long. i\\'m 5\\' tall, normally wear size 8 petite in pants and am a bit fuller in the hips.  these pants are a great length, but they are a tad bit \\'snug\\' around the fullest part of my hips.  i will order more but will order a medium rather than a small.  the style and quality are very good.  the linen used by vivid linen seems to be a cross between medium weight and handkerchief linen-great summer weight. these harem pants are awesome!  they fit me very well but i\\'m a size 10 and they would probably fit anywhere from a size 6-14....no joke. if this is the look you\\'re going for, these are the best way to achieve it.  the first time i wore this style was back in my high school days in the late 80\\'s and i\\'m so glad it\\'s back.  i like to dress them up with black patent leather ballet flats and a lightly blingy baggy top.  believe it or not, they\\'re quite slimming because the crotch is down around your knees so you can show off your lower torso and not look hippy.  i love them so much that i wore them for 2 days straight and that night got on the computer and ordered 2 more pairs.  i use one pair as pj\\'s....they\\'re lovely to cozy up on the couch in.  the other 2 are used as street clothes.  this way if one\\'s in the dirty clothes i\\'ll always have a back up pair.  if both are in the dirty clothes....then i need to just get real and put on something else! nice product, good quality, fast shipping is very good good fit noisy at walk or run. good for sweating. they really look nice , fit as i expected , i am very pleased with my purchase. good price , good quality. really comfortable, and is great to wear to my cardio dance classes. purchased these for my daughter although we both have been wearing them for years. very flattering, true to size,comfortable. delivered on time as promised everything is o.k. and i like the way my pants fits, i will recommend other people to this website. thank you so much my son loves his pj pants great pajama pants. i actually bought them to wear for a super hero themed day at work and they were a huge hit! so super soft and comfy and definitely very cute. i highly recommend them for any superhero/comic fan. i actually purchased 2 sizes, one for me, and this pair to give as a gift. i\\'m sure they will be well-received! i love it got them for my son\\'s 13th birthday, and he loves them! after reading the reviews i knew to order a size smaller than i am. i am 5\\'7&#34; and i weigh 130 lbs. i normally fit a size 5-7 depending on the brand but i went with a size 5 and they fit wonderfully. they weren\\'t skin tight or anything they gave me a nice amount of breathing room without being baggy. i imagine once i wash and dry them they will shrink to the perfect fit. my only complaint...fake pockets!!! i don\\'t know about any other women/girls out there but i can\\'t stand fake pockets, i don\\'t know if anyone else mentioned them in the comments so i didn\\'t realize they had fake front pockets but they do. i still love these pants and i will wear them, i just wish i had noticed it prior to purchasing so i wasn\\'t as surprised when they arrived. i bought this as a baby shower gift, and it was a big hit. as the baby in question is not yet born, she has not tried it on, but the size seems big enough for a 3-6 month infant. the loose fit means it could possibly be worn after 6 months, and the elastic waistband allows a snug yet stretchy fit that can grow with baby. super cute and perfect for a summer/fall girl! as long as you look at the measurements, i got compliments on them i\\'m a size 6/7 in the u.s. so there\\'s size 10 was a good enough tight fit. i don\\'t like baggy pants. was mostly tight but loose at the ankle. they been really comfortable. i purchased this outfit for my neice and it is absolutely adorable.  the price is fantastic too! love these pants!!!! by being a muslim these pants are perfect!!!! i got so many compliments on them! super comfy only place i could find fleece cargo pants made like these in brown. great fit, great price! i had a pair of these pants for quite a while. the new pair however feel a little bit loose around the waist and tummy in a  size large short. i\\'m not sure if the mediums would be too snug. otherwise the fit is good especially for me with my short legs. i ordered two pairs and will keep both.  it cost too much to send them back. they are so comfy to wear. i love the fabric and the fit. i bought a pair at a local retail outlet. i went back to buy a second pair but they disappeared. so glad i found them on amazon. my mil is very happy with them. i love these~ i ordered xl because i recently got curves, and they\\'re super comfortable~~ they feel nice to the touch and don\\'t look super cheap when stretched a bit. my only problem with them is that my ass makes them a little short in the back, but that\\'s alright. it fits everywhere else perfectly~ expected the long to be longer than it is...makes me wonder what regular would be. picture shows top part that is longer than the one i received. considering i want it to lounge around in, it works fine. love the color. i love, love, love these pants.  in fact, i will be buying more very soon!  the waste could have a little more &#34;give&#34; but for a less curvy body type, they are probably perfect. i havent worn them yet ,the quality is very good.very nice color . i also brought them for my daughter and she liked them. cool somewhat large for newborn i love love love my slimhot capris haven\\'t lost but haven\\'t gained anymore lbs got these for my dad for fathers day cuz we love the big bang theory and they are so cute and i also got the matching shirt to go with and the whole outfit is the cutest and my dad loved em thanks will deffinetly recommend... i love the feel of scrubs,as fashionable capris. my order arrived quickly, within a week.  i\\'m 5\\' 10&#34; and most yoga pants stop above my ankle. these went all the way to the floor. with shoes on, i\\'m still going to be walking on the pants a little bit, and that is okay with me.  i can always hem pants to make them shorter.  the material is thin, but not see-through, and very stretchy.  i\\'ll probably order from this seller again. returned due to the size but product was great good wore them to zumba yesterday.  were very comfortable!!! great material! not too hot feel just right with the baby smiles. fit differently than my levi\\'s. needed to go up a size to 34. sent them back for an exchange no issues. nice and comfortable lovely love it very pleased with these leggings! fit great and even received my package 2 weeks earlier than the estimated arrival date. it\\'s a real thin material, which will cause wear and stretch real soon, but it\\'s perfect on hot days when i don\\'t want to wear shorts. they help keep you cool in the gym and what not. these are very comfortable and light weight denim! great! i like them! but i ordered two pairs and one was spandex like material and the other was cotton. it was very weird but they work how i wanted them to! bought these for my dad to wear to a costume party - he needed all black clothes, and they were cheap, so it worked out. he said he never would have bought something like this, but now he wears them all the time. he says they\\'re really comfortable. nice basic cotton cargo pants. they were a bit long but otherwise fit nicely. liked them so much i ordered a few more pairs. this is an absolutely fantastic pants. fabric is very soft, it\\'s like wearing a pajamas. i love very wide waist panel. it wraps my pregnant belly very nicely, while offering some support. i know these pants are not maternity but i have to say that they fit way better than those that are designed for that purpose. love them and we ll worth the price. will buy another in different color. this pair was great!!!! the first pair we bought all the buttons fell off and we had to sew them back on. the fit was great and the material soft i absolutely love this brand. these sweats fit me extremely well and i love how they look on me. i bought a pair early last year and months later they started to rip but i had to purchase another pair because they are my favorite. on the original page grey is one of the color options, however they really are shiny silver. cute, but not what i wanted. the color description is my reason for giving 4 stars. i exchanged them for black but they didn\\'t fit the way i think they should, which in my opinion, is skin tight.i\\'m a petite girl, 5\\'1\\\\\\\\\" 103 lbs so based on the reviews i ordered a medium. i don\\'t think ordering a small would\\'ve solved the issue because around my derri√©re they fit great. the pants are awesome, fit just as expected, and are ridiculously comfortable. i did have a minor concern and they actually emailed me and corrected it right away! i\\'ve never had a company take that good of me before. i give them five stars, two thumbs up, and a thousand high fives :-) they long and fit great for someone the is 6 foot. take a look at their web sit for the sizing. i\\'ll get getting more for sure :) fits so perfect. i love rhe feel of them very comfy and cute! these fit perfect and are easily washable and wearable. i wear them in the winter and summer. minnesota is having one of the coldest winters in a long time.<br />i love putting these on early in the evening. they keep me<br />very warm. thank you very nice i ordered these for my roommate who is a serious die-hard whovian. like she can talk about it all day without repeating subjects! the pants arrived much quicker than expected and perfectly match the size that i expected. i\\'m excited to watch her open them on christmas because they are much better than the pants that look like the tardis (looks wise). i could live in these sweats! i have ordered all three colors. i wish they would make more colors. thank you for such a great product. i have a very difficult time finding wide leg active pants that don\\'t break the bank.  i was worried when i ordered these pants that they may just appear to be wide leg in the photo but i was not disappointed when they arrived.  the fit and material are wonderful, the tie waist and wide leg superb.  i run outdoors, do indoors yoga and pilates and the pants are perfect for all of these activities.  unfortunately, the one and only draw back, the pants are a little short.  i am 5\\'7\\\\\\\\\", taller than the average woman but i don\\'t typically have a problem with pant length.  i wish these came in a long but otherwise i love them! i only bought one pair just to see if they would fit me well. apparently,  they do. i\\'m 20 years old, 5\\'2&#34; 140 lbs. i bought a large & it is the perfect size. although it\\'s a little too long. probably bc they are made for people taller than i am. but it\\'s not a big deal at all. it still deserves 5 star. these are the best fitting slacks i\\'ve bought in a long time. they are very comfortable and look great. they are slim in the leg, which is what i need. i was shocked when i pulled these out of the bag.... they looked like a small and i bought an xl. i need some jeggings to wear to work. i\\'m still working on getting rid of my baby pouch so i wanted something to not give me a muffin top. they slid on with a little effort and stretch to fit. they don\\'t look like they have been stretched either. i can\\'t wait to buy more!! i gotta say i am so pleased with these! i wear a size 11 pants so i was really afraid i wouldn\\'t fit in these. when i pulled them out of the package i about died they looked so small. but lo and behold i wiggled my booty in there and they were amazing! i got the size l. used them for a rocker halloween costume. i don\\'t know that i would use them for a regular occasion the shiny leather look isn\\'t really my style but for one fun night they were fantastic! i felt sexy and wild lol. the material held up very well(thank goodness) size is accurate finally a pair of men\\'s pajamas  that fits my 6\\'7&#34; husband. it did not shrink after washing. i am 5 ft and curvier.  these pants as i expected are a little long but look great with heels! they are super comfy. the material is a little thin but i was aware that may be the case due to other reviews. i would definitely own more of these.  i do think they may be a bit overpriced due to the material being thinner but i am happy with them. very good quality material and product.  but the 12 ran two sizes smaller compared to other brands. great quality and stretchy so it will fit comfortably....love this company! the length had to altered, but they fit great. i am now known around town as the guy with the america pants. everyone recognizes them from the &#34;rex kwon do&#34; scene in napoleon dynamite. i\\'m crossing my fingers that these help with potty training! excellent very great quality and cute fit:) very thin pj pants, but super soft and comfy great fit, perfect for hooping. they are very stylish.they also allow alot of freedom of movement while doing numerous moves. loved them, even had a mix up and they took care of it. would recommend this product and this company. love them a little  long.but very cute. i was very impressed with the quality of the pants, they were tight as expected and hugged every curve (in a good way.) i haven\\'t worn them for a long period of time so i\\'m not sure how long they\\'ll last but just so far, i\\'m impressed. love it cute belly dancing pants, and they fit well and i like the sheerness to them. the little silver sparkles on the side strips fall of rather quickly though. comfortable if you are at your wit\\'s end looking for pants that offer comfort as well as good looks, these pants should be on your \\\\\\\\\"to buy\\\\\\\\\" list.  they are extremely comfortable when standing or sitting, so they are the ideal pants for traveling, walking around town, or working at the office.  they contain the optimal amount of \\\\\\\\\"stretch\\\\\\\\\" which makea them fit just right.  i have two pairs at the moment, but i definitely plan on buying more in other colors.  <br /> love these pants.  wear them with a plain black top and people love them . i like these for the gym but will also wear them out running errands etc.  they are not a heavy duty weight which i like for gym use and the way they are cut allows you to move with out a lot of binding up.  a little over priced for what you are getting though. ladies these pants are amazing! they are a soft, stretch material. i am in love!  they do run large as i read in other revirew so order a size smaller than usual. i\\'m normally a 5 and ordered a 3 they are a perfeft fit. my husband loves the way they look on me... low rise but doesnt show my crack lol. i am 5\\' 130 bls... tiny upper body with a thick short lower build... big booty! !! they look great :) love it best fitting pants i\\'ve found when traditional husky is too slim. a+ perfect! i love these pants... sooooooo comfortable!!! this was great for a birthday present! nice bit of gear! some care is needed when washing however - keep the heat down and you should be just fine. the bamboo fabric is incredibly soft and it wears well. my liitle baby seems to really feel sunggly when he wears these pants. they are a larger fit, although they aren\\'t too large. he is able to get around well and is less restricted than he is in other clothing. these pants are very comfortable. i would wear them every day if i could. the fabric is medium weight and helps flatten my stomach. they run a little large but i am happy to size down. i did and they are loose. that being said, it is such a cute fit. true black, does not fade with washing. yes to everything about this. yes, it is very comfortable with soft material. yes, it is very fashionable and the various pieces are perfect for transition seasons like fall and spring where you can layer or remove layers based on fluctuating temperatures. the colors are deep and rich and very detailed. perfect for the true doctor who fan.  colors stay vibrant after many washes. great pants.  a second button at the bottom helps modify width of pants at shoe. love them!  it\\'s like wearing pj\\'s to work and working at a school, you need room to move. so many compliments from those i\\'ve never met.  packaged very nicely.  they get wrinkled, yes, but that\\'s linen and the look of linen.  i hang on a good hanger and they look fine.  will be purchasing another pair. great for around the house at night. this shirt is a great fit....i love it.  i actually wear it to yoga.  only issue is that it took quite a while to ship and arrive. best set ever! great quality, comfortable material, rich colors and perfect for dressing up or dressing down baby. use in spring or fall for fluctuating temperatures, baby movement classes, mommy and me, parties, playdates, etc. elephants are considered good luck! these are the best pants ever! they\\'re super soft just the way i like. they\\'re super baggy just the way i like. they\\'re amazing for after a long day at work! they\\'re super super comfy. seriously, the best! i have been looking everywhere for pants with a fleece lining. you can find flanel anywhere but for warmth, comfort, durability, and keeping dry nothing can match fleece. i would only recommend that you get them a size larger. when i first tried them on the were a wee bit snug or i need to stop eating out. highly recommended for outdoor upland adventures or work. so far they have been very durable with no complaints not since my audition for the \\\\\\\\\"u can\\'t touch this\\\\\\\\\" video have i seen pants these amazing. five stars are really not enough, i would select the entire galaxy of stars, suns, black holes, and hemorrhoids to even give these pants a wink of a chance of what they are worth. now i am not a particularly attractive person, and have, in fact, been called \\\\\\\\\"a hideous monster\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\"pedophyle-like\\\\\\\\\", and \\\\\\\\\"just plain disgusting.\\\\\\\\\" but these pants have changed my life. it could be that people are so wowed by my pants that they are too distracted to look at my face, or they are captivated by my monkey wrench dangling betwixt my legs as i walk in these (might i add, swoosh-less) pants, but whatever it is, they attract all kinds of ladies. i even buy zebra stripe gum to make sure to match my whole outfit. i can blend in easily in any serengeti setting or at the local zoo, where i get my kicks showing off my new \\\\\\\\\"business in the front, party in the back\\\\\\\\\" look. although i have yet to be approached by anyone with more than 4 strands of hair and 6 teeth, i know that i\\'m not buying the cow because the milk\\'s always free when you rock zubaz! huzzah! i have others of the same material and wears very well. i wish it had a drew string to help keep it from dropping too low! fit snug and comfortable they are like hugs for my legs!!! like them. takes a while to receive them but they are of good quality this style fits snug in the waist but has a baggy fit every where else. the inseams are generous, so don\\'t order a tall unless you really need it. the material is tough and the seams hold up to full time contruction. my daughter wanted both stylish and sporty jeans in one order. these pants worked perfectly. the product arrived in \\'good\\' timing. the fit was perfect. the color was true to its description. i wanted them for a christmas gift, but she found them before i could wrap them. therefore they are great! thanks. bought these for a party but in all actuality i kind of love them and would wear them again.  they\\'re fleece lined which was kinda amazing!  i\\'m pretty petite; 5\\'6 and a little under 120 and they fit me great. amazing! really great quality, great fit. really comfortable and soft. nicely made and definitely worth it. typically wouldn\\'t buy these types of items on line. i was concerned they wouldn\\'t fit as i would have liked. these pants fit perfectly. i like alfred dunner it\\'s comfortable and washes up so well fit is good i bought this for my son for christmas and he loves them!  fits true to size and great for that patriotic person in your family! the material is nice...i little thin but wonderful and look great on me. make my waist look small and behind look like &#34; here i am!&#34; blue banana has won themselves a loyal and longtime customer! i love this uk company! american companies could learn a lot from bb. their clothing is top notch and when i received a pair of pants with a defective zipper, i emailed bb and zoe was unbelievably kind and unexpectedly patient. she sent a replacement straight away. what a delight she was to deal with! bb is the place to shop! a+! love it 4 stars because i literally just got this product, and i haven\\'t tested it out at the festival i\\'m going to attend in two days. expectations are pretty high for these, since they\\'re so far comfortable to wear and walk in. the elastic around the ankles and the waist seem just right for me, and they seem like they have a decent air flow through them, which will come in handy out in the heat.<br /><br />i just wish they got my 3/4 pants correct the first time, so now i\\'m sketchy about the company\\'s quality when pulling things off the shelf. fit great thanks they are fluffy and nice to look at my daughter wishes she could where pjs to school every day may buy more thanks they looked just like the picture it is a christmas present for my husband it arrived on time and i love the way they look. they seem a bit large, but i bet they will fit after i wash them. thanks. i really like them. the material is beautiful, the workmanship is excellent and the color is perfect for so many occasions.  love them. looking forward to winter. i wasn\\'t sure if i would keep this yoga pant because i have to pull up the waist as it slips down due to be low in the rise i think. i decided to keep them because ultimately they are flattering and have true coverage. it fits well, looks nice.  the waist is a bit tight but i can manage.  the pockets do add a bit to my hips though.  its thicker than yoga pants so i like it and its comfortable. it has withstood many washes. overall, its a good product. my 26-month-old daughter is 36\\\\\\\\\" tall and 30 pounds, and the 2t training pants fit her perfectly -- neither too tight nor too loose. (she would be 3t in these according to the height range, but i personally think the weight range is the more important one for these.) the leg openings are a tad snug around her thighs when we first put them on her, but better to have them be slightly snug and then stretch/loosen enough to be comfortable, than to be so loose as to let accidents run free.     we bought two 3-packs of these here and then found another 3-pack at target (with one solid pink, one white with pastel flowers, and one white with pastel cupcakes), so 9 pairs gets us through a \\\\\\\\\"good\\\\\\\\\" week with only a couple accidents, or a few \\\\\\\\\"oops\\\\\\\\\" days. they\\'ve held up just fine through both warm and hot washer cycles, and we dry them on medium. and you will want to put them through the dryer, i think, versus hanging dry, because that\\'s how the fabric will stay soft and the fluffy padded layer will stay fluffy.    of course they are not super absorbent, but that\\'s the point of cloth training pants, or so i think. i preferred not to have a waterproof cover, for comfort and to let my daughter get used to the way real underwear will feel. so your child will wind up with wet pants when they have accidents of the \\\\\\\\\"wet\\\\\\\\\" kind, since there is no waterproof layer with these to contain wetness, so do have extra changes of clothes on hand. but i can say firsthand that they do contain accidents of the bulkier kind, so when it does happen (and it will!), at least it\\'ll all be waiting for you in there and won\\'t have gone anywhere else. ugh. the things we do. hooray for us! good to buy!!! i got a large, but i think a medium would be much more comfortable. i washed them hoping they would shrink a little (they didn\\'t) so i will keep them even though they are not exactly what i was looking for.<br /><br />good: comfortable material, my boyfriend says he likes them<br /><br />not so good: i don\\'t usually fold over the top because if i do i feel as if they are going to fall off. if you have curves make sure to get a size that fits or else be prepared for them to roll off your hips. i think if these were a little tighter they would probably stay put. i feel as if the bottoms flair more then they should - again possibly due to them being a bit large.<br /><br />note on length - they are long. i am about 6\\' and am happy with the length. if you are shorter than that (or have short legs) these are going to be super long. these fit wonderfully.  i was shocked that these fit so great.  i\\'m very tall and plus sized and these were just perfect. very nice, soft and comfortable for my son.  we are hp fans and these pants were a perfect addition to our hp clothing collection! finally pants that make sense!  most infant pants have synthetic plastic fiber that can cause rashes.  more importantly most infant pants are too tight.  these are nice and comfy and roomy! these are the best pants she has despite tons of clothes from the very expensive baby stores in the mall! i was nervous to order these cause they were cheap, and i usually dont have alot of luck with yoga pants because theyr always to tight on the crotch area, but these are soft, long, cozy and roomy. i love them :) pretty fast shipping too. but since they were cheap im sure they will not last very long. thats why i gave 4 stars. i like this pant and i\\'ll purchase more from the same brand &#60;3 the fabric is soft and flexible and has a good quality feel.  the pants do not bind anywhere yet are not too baggy.  i want more of these in other colors now that i have the dark teal blue ones.  excellent purchase. when i saw these pants, i wondered if they would even fit me. i am petite, five foot two inches and have a small upper body, but my legs are a little thick. these fit me great, and the material is so soft! they are my favorite pair of leggings. they are great for yoga class as they aren\\'t see through. i would definitely recommend. my wife loves these, they are &#34;great, and she loves to dress them up!&#34; comfortable and well made. the size was accurate to what was ordered, she\\'s a size 5 and they fit perfect for a size 5. fits very well. however i wear underneath a lighter pair of pants when i run. i also wear them underneath work clothes due we have had temperatures as low as negative 5 degrees. this is the best thing $16.99 could buy as clothing. can\\'t get any better. fit me perfectly and very confy and cute. love them!!! excellent product i recommend, the fabric is very cool for the use of babies, the fabric is not damaged when washing machine wash, do not choose or stretch. what recoiendo. thanks i would recommend these for somebody who is getting lace up boots. they worked very well i wore them outside during a warm day but stayed cool the material is very lite and breaths well.  its only real drawback is that the top of the slim section was tight and took some work to get on. but i would recommend. these pants are so comfortable and flatter your body shape. the shipping is very fast, mine shipped out the same day i ordered them. i am glad i came across these! i purchased the black and will be buying more in the other beautiful colors!!! fake front pockets, but real back pockets, both have rhinestones adorned to them. i bought a smaller size after reading all the reviews and they fit a little tight. i\\'m expecting them to stretch a little when i wear them all day. great length, i\\'m 5\\'4 and they fit long but do not bunch up with boots likes some long leggings do. don\\'t look like stretch/sweat pants, kind of have that trouser look to them. will look great under boots or with heels for work. my fiance loves these. she wears them to bed and says that they are very comfortable and fit as expected at a good price. i usually take the chains off the tripp pants, but i like the handcuffs a bit. i like their design a lot. they have quite a bit of pockets, each with a nice amount of room in them.<br /><br />at first, the tripp people or bewild made a mistake with the shipping, i don\\'t know which, but the tag said medium, but the pants were xl inside. bewild was quick to ship the correct medium pair. i just had to take pictures of the pants i first received, and with the correct pair they sent a box to ship the wrong pair, and it took a little while after shipping, but they credited the money, since they had to send 2 pairs of pants. and i didn\\'t pay for anything, except for the original pair\\'s cost. glad to have got them. some chains are harder to remove on the pants, most are very easily removed. husband loved it.  fits like it should. good quality out fit. price was right. my nephew and his parents were happy. would recommend to others if you are fans. product quality better than expected. very happy with the quality and the way it fits. somewhat large but it\\'ll eventually fit. :) they are very good, specially for winter, but 3t was big for 2.5 years old boy, but he likes to wear them great for my 4 year old playing pee wee flag football. exactly like the ones the coach hands out (those had stains, so i ordered these). great pants! exactly what i expected. good pair of fr pants. plenty useful pockets. perfect except for the stitching. could be stronger thread but can easily be fixed with a needle and thread at home. fit just fine and was delivered quick. thanks! light weight. comfy pants. they are so cute when paired with a white short sleeve sheer top. i need to buy 4 more pairs. i bought them for my girlfriend and they are hands down her favorite pair of pants. these are a very high quality item.  i was pleasantly surprised when i opened the packaged and could feel with my hands just how thick, soft, and warm these pants are.  they are made to repel wet snow very effectively, and i can\\'t imagine finding a better pair of snow/ski pants anywhere.  they fit my son perfectly (with an adjustable waistband).  i highly recommend these pants! these worked out very well for my boyfriend\\'s costume. they do run a little small so you might want to order larger than what you might think you\\'d need. i am 6 foot tall.....i always have a problem with yoga pants not being long enough..........these are ok....wish they were 1&#34; longer! love it i found these really comfy and perfect for working out. i got them and they were just slightly larger than expected, but not by much. after the first wash they for nice and snugg. will buy more for sure! super stretchy and comfortable! great for working out, lounging around or everyday wear. these capris are awesome. you can wear them high waisted with the waistband up or fold in half for a low rise. the fabric is high quality and made very well. all stitching is nice and tight and sturdy. pixelated camo print strip for added detail. they are cute and trendy! these have become a favorite. i find myself reaching for them the most. recommended!  *sample provided to review they were purchased for my teenaged son, and he loves them! i bought these for my mom.  i had on some pants that were similar and she thought they looked comfortable as she doesn\\'t like anything tight across her stomach.  she loves them, says they fit perfect and are very comfortable. these are soft, stretchy, and come in so many colors. the fit is great. nice and roomy in the tush for cloth diapers. the length leaves some room to grow and easily cuffs while still looking cute - same color inside as outside. i ordered these for my felix-loving girlfriend, and when they came i was a little concerned because the cloth felt rough and a little uncomfortable. however, after one washing they softened up considerably and they\\'re now very wearable. she loves them and wears them frequently. the only concern is that they also shrank quite a bit when washed. she\\'s 5\\' and i got her the small. when they came they were a couple inches too long, but after washing they were just about right, maybe slightly long. so think carefully about sizes before you buy and it should turn out fine. shipped as a gift. looks adorable on the baby. i was a little skeptical about the difference between these and regular undies, but they are very absorbent. it was nice because when my son would pee a little on the way to the potty it didn\\'t dribble every wear. they are soft and seem comfortable for my little man in training. love them. they were longer than i thought but they fit in my hips so longer pant legs are to be expected great very comfy but kinda extra shinny these worked great for my 5.5 month old who usually wears 9 month clothing. they will probably last him another month or so before he grows out of them, so i\\'d say they run on more if the 9-10 month clothing size range rather than 11-12.<br />they are nice quality and soft, too. they need more colors! these are the real thing, military stile camouflage cargo pants. they have room in the waist. i could have worn a small, but like all military pants like this the waist has two adjustments. i used to adjust the waist to the proper size. this featire is awesome because when i gain weight i can let the waist out. the fly is a button fly which i\\'m not used to. i\\'m indifferent about this. i love these pants. however, all those reviews say to size up. i did & i should\\'ve ordered more true to size. i\\'m 5\\'4 about 115lbs and i got the l size 6. the waist is too big and the rest of pant is quite baggy. luckily, its nothing a good belt can\\'t fix. as for baggy part, i like them that way anyway. great buy! fits good looks very cute on, the only complaint my wife has is after awhile the top portion starts to scratch and irritate her breasts since this is always wore braless. love them!!  going to india for a visit and needed lightweight pants.  very light weight, sits nicely on my size 2-4 waist, and just a tad too baggy in legs but it looks okay since it shapes the butt nicely!!  may get a few more!! love love love these pants, so comfortable i ordered the large and was expecting it to fit a bit baggier. anyway think enough to wear outdoors during winter months but not so thick that its too hot for working out. these are so cute , they are high waisted and fitted up on top which gives a very slimming effect . they could not be more comfortable ! the training pants seem like a nice product but their sizes are off.  my daughter is tall, average size (not skinny) and 41 pounds.  i chose the xlarge for 39-44 lbs.  they are way too big and would have leaked around the legs even after washing.  the sizes of their products are more for stocky kids.  so i am returning them and purchasing  the next size down. i will have to pay for returning them but they waived the shipping on the smaller size order.  they were very helpful on the phone and they arrived in three days.  the same goes for the waterproof covers. these jeans are awesome! perfect color and fit. i saw somthing similar to these in a nearby store, but i didn\\'t purchase them because of the feel of the fabric, sort of stiff and it reminded of the stretch pants my mom made me wear back in the late 60\\'s! when i saw these i liked the price first of all then the fold down waist but what sold me was the cotton content. when they arrived i opened them and was so delighted with the feel of the fabric i put them on and they fit just right, these pants are comfortable and sturdy, i would wear them almost anywhere.i am so glad i found these pants on amazon, now the ideal top to go with them, is my next quest! if you thought you could not find kikwear anymore, this is the place for you. my son was so proud to have a new comfortable pair of these jeans. it made his day :0) good pants but a little small. the fold over top is very long. if i exposed the same amount of midriff as the photo - it would appear as a little mini skirt. 17 yr. old is happy with the color and fit. soft and comfortable my son loves them, what can i say, pants were a gift for my son and he loved them. he is a tall guy and the length was just right and the fit was roomy enough. he loves the softness and comfort of lounging in them. would purchase again. i was leary when i bought them unsure what they would fit like being one size fit all. but i love the jumper i am a size 12 but i am small in my bust area and they look great on. i recommend this outfit to anyone. enjoy the fit. comfortable, fun  with a little flair of a skirt attached. good wear for those movements where you need flexability. to fllmsy looked amazing on my wife quality material great product...this item is a great value for the price it\\'s extraordinary beautifully made and great quality will buy again from this seller. the waist might be a little tight if you have a bit of a belly. i will be wearing it to my next interview. these are cute.  they do seem to run on the small side. they fit me just right at the moment, but i know if they accidentally get tossed into the dryer they will be way too small. i can tell by the quality of cotton that they will shrink and end up being too tight and too short (i\\'m 5\\' 9 1/2&#34; and a very average size 8-10 in jeans & purchased the size large, for reference).  not sure how long they\\'ll last, but for now they\\'re fine. fits nicely and is well made! i love these pants! they are really confortable and i can wear them for a casual look or for a more dress up occasion. they fit really well and the material is soft and fresh. i\\'m a plus size and these pants make me look about 6 sizes down. definitely recommend them. great pants! i\\'m 5\\'7 and they\\'re perfect length with my sneakers! with flats to longüòê well made but they run very large.  my son wears a size 6 and he is swimming in these pants. these leggings make you look very fit. they enhance what need to be enhanced and hide what needs to be hid. lol. i got a medium but could have gotten a small. i think they fit true to size and for anyone thinking about purchasing them , i would get my right size. it took a few weeks before i received them but no big deal i wasn\\'t in a rush. very nice and so comfy material but small is just big for me, i should have gotten xs. my daughter loved these shorts awesome item, i love my jeans, which are now my new fav. true to size and i love the back pockets, they give your butt that higher lift. fits true to size. i am snug in a size three and these fit perfect in a size 5. thank you and i will be using the coupon as soon as i get it!!! was exactly what i was looking for!! great fit and very comfortable. i ordered so many of these from amazon that i am ready for anything. i know looked all over amazon to get solid tops to match all the ones i purchased. they are just too easy to slip on and go. i don\\'t wear heals because i have bad feet but they look great with my black capezio dance shoes that i purchased on amazon. from the picture, the fabric appeared as if it may have been heavier-which i definitely would have appreciated as i live in a suburb of chicago and that would have made this purchase perfect for the unpredictable weather here! still, with leggings or tights underneath, this is a great looking and versatile pair of pants. i definitely plan to get more in other colors! the length may be a little short on taller individuals. i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; and it was almost uncomfortable for me. i wore them with ankle boots which enhanced the look and compensated for the lack of leg length. fast shipping! perfect fit! thank you i\\'m a size  5 so i ordered a medium it fits perfect lovely! i love these. i\\'m ordering more today! fit great! the rise is just right, no muffin top, fits like ladies pants not juniors... but not steve urkle high or anything. these are great pants. seriously good buy!!!!! i am 5\\'9&#34; and size medium fit great! good for yoga and lounging around the house! flattering on the booty! these are my favorite scrubs. they fit good and i really like that they have elastic waistband and also drawstrings. i will continue buying these as long as they make them. i\\'ve never had luck buying leggings online before... until these! these leggings are actually long enough to cover my ankles, the waist is pretty high which i like, the pattern is gorgeous, they\\'re super stretchy but not baggy, and they\\'re thin but not sheer or see through! for under $10 i am extremely pleased. these pants are kind of magic. i was a little afraid when i opened the box that they wouldn\\'t fit - they look tiny - but they totally fit me and i\\'m a size 18! they are really sheer, don\\'t let the other reviewers tell you different. i have to wear leggings under them. and the bottoms don\\'t poof out as much as i\\'d like or what\\'s shown in the picture. but still, they are nice harem pants. my daughter\\'s dance school ordered the wrong size for her so i had to find a pair that i would get in time for her recital and these were perfect! they are an easy fit, stretchy and much more comfortable than the ones they ordered. they arrived within 2 days right on schedule. saved the day! she is a very tall and full-figured 8 year old and the size xs fit her perfectly. i have put on some weight and not able to comfortably where jeans so i ordered these thinking they would be comfy and give the look of a jean style pant. i am very satisfied with them. these pants should be ok.  i bought them for street motorcycle riding as i had recently bought a long sleeve rip stop tactical shirt for the same purpose.  the pants are a little baggy and not to the liking of my wife, but i will get some use out of them.  the shirt was a better value at around $30 whereas the pants were $56.  my experience so far with tactical stuff is positive, as it is tough as hell, but you need to do your research before you buy. normally, i wear a 4 in the us, so i ordered the size 6 (us)/8 (uk), they fit perfectly. the quality seems very good, but time will tell. the pockets are a good size/depth. i wish the cargo ones were ever so slightly deeper.<br /><br />they arrived much faster than expected. made from good material, and they are very comfortable bought the 6 - 9 months for my granddaughter who is 7 months old. its perfect. she will still be able to grow a little and it will still fit well. love the colors and material. i like it but it won\\'t\\u200b work if you have a booty. the only dress pants that i buy for work are style & company petite.  they fit perfectly, they look great, they are stylish,and they last forever.  try them.  you will love them! i am 5\\'6 120 lbs (ordered the small),and usually get the victoria\\'s secret yoga pants because they fit my long slender legs. i was pleasantly surprised at the fact that these fit the same way that my vs pants do. the only thing i don\\'t like it the fact that they pick up so much hair. everywhere i sat i had hair and fuzz all over me. bought wine three years ago for cna and they\\'re still wearing great... have to come back now and get the next colors for rn clinicals, will come back again after nclex for the rn colors...  am very satisfied with the wear and the price.<br />(update)<br />had to retire the cna and student scrubs as i have updated them with rn colors.  the old ones are just as usable as the ones i just got. very happy with my choice. maybe not better but just as good.  size is a little big but for $1 cheaper per pkg than gerber, no problem. great fitting leggingsüòòüòòüòò loved these, just ordered 2 other colors. they stretch to fit perfect..li am in love and will be buying more...oh and they included a 10 percent off next purchase and a nail file just wish i could get them in gray & black. these are my new favorite pants. i\\'ll have to get another pair after i lose the baby weight. i received the item ahead of time and as expected. the leggings are a perfect fit! very stretchy and soft material. very soft, amazing quality blanket - smaller than most swaddling blankets but definitely worthy of your most precious newborn and though they won\\'t remember it, they will love the feel of it!!  it lasts through multiple washings and never loses the luxurious soft feeling. this was for my daughter\\'s baby shower. i found 3 other sozo items to match it. she just loved it! the quality is very nice. this was was second purchase of these pants..i just love them and they are so comfortable. these pants are great. really stretchy, very cute, and long enough for my baby to grow into. favorite pants ever. i should buy another pair for when i have to wash the 1st pair. i have ordered several pairs of wallflower brand jeans. this was my first pair of khaki\\'s and they fit just like my jeans. i will be ordering more!! my daughter felt like a big girl. now she is completely trained and happy. fast service, the size is not true to size. fits smaller. but it\\'s a great material and i do love the pants my daughter loves these pants! wanted to find johnny depp stuff for her and this store had these cool sleepwear at a good price. i really really like these pants - fashionable without being too flashy.  i like their look better than the zumba pants so popular around here.  based on other reviews, which said they run big, i ordered size m instead of my usual l and they fit fine.  i might buy some more. good dress pants these pants are amazing....abdrew christian is the only thing i\\'d like to clothe my lower body in from here on out! these pants fit like a glove, and the sideways crotch zipper really accentuates what i have to offer the world! this is a good value for the money. i bought mainly to replace my rainpants that got destroyed by mice. they keep me dry and not to hot to wear. these were a little thin but worked great! they were a great buy and wore well, and true to size. i was initially concerned about whether or not they would fit my son.  he\\'s 2.5 y/o but about 40&#34; tall and weighs 37 lbs.  they fit perfectly. a little high in the waist but do the job! i usually wear a size small but i read other reviews of the sweat suit running small so i ordered it in a medium and it fits perfectly.  the fabric is quite thin but i like it. very warm. fit well. i have at least 15 different styles of the same brand pant. i feel like a rockstar at the gym but i also wear them out to go dancing with stilettos and a sexy top. super tight and sexy fit. it is the sweetest thing! the baby arrives this weekend and is to appear next weekend at his aunt\\'s wedding. just what we were looking for! very cute! although its wayyyyyy too short i should bought a bigger size love them look just like jeans fit perfectly a lil big in the waist but that\\'s okay i love them!! might order some more. !!!!!!! :) first i ordered these pants yesterday, and they arrived today!  i was shocked.  some of the other items i ordered yesterday have not even been finished yet, let alone shipped to my house!  more importantly, my daughter loves these pants.  the fit is true to size, comfortable, easy to move in.  the little rhinestones and frills on the bottom of each leg are absolutely adorable. slightly transparent, but very comfortable. i got it for her for christmas and she loves it. she wants more of this pants, she says they are very comfortable and cozy. wife said it\\'s a perfect fit. i get so many complements on them when i wear it.  they are very comfortable and stylish!  get them! love these pants. very comfortable.  go well with a fitted t-shirt, or a dressy top.  i would definitely purchase again!<br />. perfect, just what i ordered, i recommend buying these over any lower bdu trousers. i am 5\\'8\\'\\' and weigh 200 pounds, large is perfect. im 5\\'8, 135 lbs and ordered a medium. super high waist but fit was perfect and was long enough. would definitely recommend. got them for my son as he\\'s into the modern baggy look you see in the pros and in college.  they appear way too long, but actually fit fine and didn\\'t have to use the velcro length adjustments on the sides of each leg.  what may look funny to someone, may just look perfect to someone else.  ua sliding shorts fit fine underneath, not too tight.  they\\'re well constructed and worth the money! these pants are great!!!  so great i ordered another pair in another color.  shipping was fast.  they are just as i had hoped. excellent! i got my first pair of these back in 2006 and bought another two pairs last year. what i love most about them is that i\\'m not allowed to wear jeans at work and whenever i wear a long shirt no one seems to notice that they\\'re made of jean material due to their looking so neat. the deep pockets are a huge attraction as are the side panel pockets which are great for your cellphone. as with every carhartt product i\\'ve owned, their durability is excellent. they last forever. these pants are no exception; an excellent buy in my view. excelente tela, color y acabados. producto 100% recomendado. es el multicam modelo origanal de combate, las tallas son precisas y son muy resistentes. i have trouble with finding jeans that are both tight enough that they show off my figure but not too tight that when i sit down i get muffin top. these pants are perfect! they are super soft, super stretchy and form fitting. they move well with my body but they don\\'t get all stretched out throughout the day, perfect for sitting down and avoiding your stomach from folding over. super comfortable, and not to mention do wonders to your butt! i am going to buy tons more colors! thank you fit perfectly, and very comfortable beautiful pant! love them they are every thing u could want in pjs too cute being a big goofy fan it\\'s exactly what i was looking for.  now i need to find some slippers. thanx! most sweatpants make the wearer look shapeless and even overweight - they\\'re comfortable but not necessary flattering. these sweatpants fit very well, like a pair of pants, and look more like pants than sweatpants. i feel much more comfortable wearing these out to go to the grocery store or something or to run quick errands than i did my normal home clothes.<br /><br />the pants features drawstrings, a zipper fly, 2 regular side pockets, 2 back velcro-closed pockets, and 2 cargo pockets, and elastic cord at the bottoms. i\\'m thinking of ordering another pair great perfect they fit great, perfect length, easy care and they don\\'t even seem to be a cat hair magnet.<br />( i have 3) they are comfortable and just the right length! i would recommend this product! the only thing i would want is to have these pants in lighter colors like a pale blue etc.. you\\'ll put them on and never take them off.... i love these and i wear them literally all the time. i get compliments on them a lot, and they fit very well. the only negative aspect of them is that they are quite sheer. just make sure you wear the proper undergarments and it should be fine. so far so good!  of course, it remains to be seen how well the pants will hold up. the price was great an pants was also great for that price will buy again got one for my buddie he love them// love these yoga pants and they were nice and long. these are ok, very comfortable, better than a different brand i had ordered. very soft and actually very comfortable. good i have become enamored of the clothing from vivid linen this summer, having bought numerous sleeveless tops, dresses, and cropped pants. i decided to give these harem pants a try because they look really comfortable and also cute, in a funky way (though funky is not my typical style). well, i love them! like everything else i\\'ve tried from this company, the quality of the fabric, cut, design and assembly are top notch. with a more close fitting top, the pants have a really nice silhouette and do not make me look huge, which was my main concern. they actually are surprisingly flattering, in a unique way, so i can understand why other purchasers have reported so many compliments. they drape really well, are super comfortable, and...well, let\\'s say i\\'m now considering some other colors. :)<br />p.s. i am a consistent us size 8, it44, and size medium fits perfectly. these are great very comfortable. i think i want 5 more pairs. wonderful glad i purchased these pants. great great! good quality and it actually holds up my pants well! nice feel, nice weight. very nice pants for women everywhere would recommend comfortable use my husband liked these so much that i bought 2 for him. for xl feels a bit small a little big but very comfy & cozy...happy with sos lounge pants. i purchased these pants because of the color and style of the waist area mainly. i wanted something different looking than plain yoga pants or the fold-over style that seems popular for dance and yoga right now. the \\\\\\\\\"ruched-up\\\\\\\\\" style of the waist of these pants looked really attractive to me. the pants are beautifully made and very soft and flow-y. unfortunately the only size available is a push for my size. i\\'m a 34 inch waist with a generous booty and that was the limit of stretch for these pants. they\\'re still comfortable and from the front actually look pretty good. however, even though they don\\'t pull at me, the back is kind of clingy. i just wanted something nice and soft to work out in so these will do nicely. just if you\\'re considering buying them for anything other than workout pants i\\'d make sure you fit well under the size limit. nice item, had a lot of laughs about what goes in the pocket. these are awesome harem pants my daughter loves them. they look amazing and fit amazing  tons of compliments.  only problem is their alittle on the thin side  the seam started seperating after 1 wearing.  if purchasing them handle with care. i ordered this as a gift for my massive whovian roommate. she is in love with them. they fit as an adult large should, and arrived only 2 days after i ordered them. i would highly recomend this product! i love the fabric, pockets and fit of these scottevest pants. but the belt loops make me crazy. they are 2+inches wide which makes inserting the belt difficult and clipping keys on impossible. they are spaced at nw, sw, se & ne; which interferes with the most common locations for cell phone belt clips. i would happily replace all my other slacks when the belt loops are slimmed down. i\\'m 5\\' tall, so it\\'s hard to find good pants that are the correct length. the 26\\\\\\\\\" short inseam fits great! i really like the textured design, too. the pants are made of a lighter material than i expected, but that\\'s not a bad thing. perfect item, fast shipping - 100% recommended!!! my wife loved them! it\\'s great my husband is a builder and a sailor with a lean frame.  both activities require him to be on his knees to perform various tasks, and he has knobby knees without much padding. i have been searching for padded knee pants since the brand he wore was discontinued. while shopping online with my daughters, i mentioned my dilemma and we began searching. we found burson work pants and ordered a pair. my husband is very pleased with the fit (which is true to size), durability and overall performance (the knee pads don\\'t pull up too high when bending down). i\\'d like to add that he looks hot in them, which is always a bonus! he wears them for both building and sailing, and recommends them to anyone wanting comfortable knee pad pants for a reasonable price. love them but run a little large to me. very comfortable though! black on the outside, yellow on the inside just what i wanted. thought i was purchasing a substitute to leggings i saw on someone else but, they are the exact same! i love the sweat and they makes my legs look smoother. plan to purchase the shorts too. shipped quick!<br />you should show image of inside ..... guaranteed to increase sales.<br /><br />happy customer a bit small, but so soft and comfortable where it counts they are very thick and warm. they fit nicely as well color is dull in person though not nearly as vibrant as the picture. i love kicky pants.  easily my most favorite brand of all my daughter\\'s stuff, and i\\'m always happy after laundry when i know i have 3 or 4 clean kicky pants items.  they are so soft - a pleasure against my skin and hers.  they wash and dry well (well, at least in the 5 times i\\'ve washed it).<br /><br />in general kicky pants, my daughter is still size newborn at 3 weeks old.  the general sizing of the brand is accurate.<br /><br />however, with the gowns, i have a gown in 0-3 months and decided to order this one in 3-6 months.  i keep her in the 3-6 month size.  there\\'s no reason not to.  the sleeves and neck and stretch enough that they aren\\'t at all big on her.  but the nice thing with the larger size is that the length is longer and her feet stay in and covered.  there is no downside whatsoever to ordering large.  the 0-3 fits her, but it\\'s short and her feet easily escape.  again, she is just a bit over 7 lbs and still newborn in all things including kicky pants footies.  but easily comfortable and best dressed in the 3-6 months.  order up - you won\\'t regret it. love the stars and stripes its odom.look very stylish.every body like the look. these pants are very comfortable but they run a bit short. mine sit a couple inches above my ankles and i\\'d guess my legs are average length. these products fit as advertised and are very comfortable, especially for someone like me whose size has gotten a little larger than previously. fits her like a glove. :d bought this as a gift for my mom and not only did it ship super fast, it was a perfect fit. she loved it!!! comfortable and stylish - a  great basic for many occasions.  rayon in the fabric gives it a nice finish.  washes well. these pants are adorable & seem to be well made.they are on the thin side though so keep that in mind. so pretty and comfy !!!! i really like how it fits, but sometimes it rides up a lot. my boyfriend says it makes my butt look very nice. they are a huge hit with guys, they love my spandex. i would recommend these to any one looking for cheap spandex for under dresses and/or cheer, yoga, and stretching. these have become our favorite training &#34;panties.&#34; they hold a lot of pee, and while not completely waterproof they are the best i\\'ve found. they aren\\'t the cutest print, but that doesn\\'t bother our daughter. their performance has won me over.<br /><br />for non-waterproof, hanna andersen trainers are our favorites (super cute! also most absorbent without a waterproof liner), followed by greensprouts. we also have some gerbers but they leak the fastest. the material is a bit thin, but i like the fold over top. my one size issue is that i wish they were a big longer, i am 5\\'8&#34; and 130lbs so length is always an issue for me. still that being said, i like them and wear them all the time i love these jeans there comfy and perfect bought this pants and it fit well. it was a bit long but that\\'s my fault should have bought the shorter length. material is soft and can be worn to work or casually for an outing. i\\'m very impressed on how quickly these leggings arrived from this vendor. thank you for your great customer service<br />if anything that will put you on my list to purchase from you again. as far as the leggings they are very nice and stretch<br />nicely and stay intact but i think i should have ordered a size larger. overall if you are thinking of purchasing these leggings<br />do it!! you will be pleased. th fold over was thicker than i expected, but still very comfy. just can\\'t wear any of my form fit workout shirts w/it love them i love these pants! they are perfect these do make you sweat and the dry very fast after you take them off. i got pants and not capri\\'s and if they are suppose to be capri\\'s then they are way to big otherwise they fit just fine. i have not yet had a chance to wear them during a workout but i will this evening after work. i am hoping they increase my calorie burn and expedite my weight loss and body toning. i will update this review later. i am shocked at how much higher in price these are through amazon! i thought for sure i would find a better deal here, i guess not. these scrubs were exactly what i wanted.  i spent time looking through the many different types of scrubs offered here at amazon.  these seemed like the best combination of features (like pockets), color, size, and price, so i bought \\'em.  they are exactly what i expected and are actually one of the lower-priced scrubs out there.  highly recommended. i own two weather company rain suits:  one for golf and one for running.  i also have gore-tex which i consider too heavy, leaving me clammy after a while.  you\\'ll like these pants. no pockets these jogger pants fit perfectly except for the length. i am 5\\'11 & these appear to have been made for someone 5\\' 9&#34;.  i washed the pants as directed, expecting them to shrink. to my surprise no shrinking happened.  i wear them around the house & in the yard. it\\'s a shame because i really would wear them out in public if they were longer. i received this product in exchange for my honest opinion. arrived swiftly<br />luv pants love them i agree with the reviewers before me, this runs a bit tight so get the next size up if you are not a fan of legging style running pants.  other than that, great product! i have quite a few pairs of palazzo pants and these are one of my favorite designs. awesome! would love more in different colors/patterns. perfect for the hot weather love the jean, they do look expensive and the shipping was fast too. i usually wear a size 8 to 10 for a dress, cause i have a big behind and for this jean i took size 13 which fit perfect for me fast shipping and great product as advertised! very nice suits that are a proper fit. i needed shorts for underneath a costume that was a skirt, due to the heavy amount of dancing necessary in the show.  these crept up a little too high at times, but overall, did the trick. looks great , never have a problem with parachute pants, but the size can be smaller so be careful. super comfy, fit right, well made, survives washes.. i\\'m not what to say beyond i\\'ll keep buying these and their amazing tanks as well... love it,  nice fit,  good price and fast delivery these were too small but again i lost weight and now they are a perfect fit. pleasantly surprised! super comfy & cute. bought for cruise, can wear casual or dress them up. i bought these pj\\'s as a solution to the inability of finding short sleeves for 3-11 mo olds.  i always see pj\\'s for 12 mo olds and up and i was getting frustrated as the summer is becoming hot with my infant not needing the longer sleeved outfits.  i put them on her shortly after recieving the outfit.  she loved them pulling on the shirt immediately.  she looked really cute and they fit perfectly on her.  she is a little small for her age as she was a preemie.  she\\'s about 11 1/2 lbs about 23 in long.  i got her 3-6 mo size and they couldn\\'t fit any better.  she is currently wearing 3-6 mo clothes.  she was comfortable (as she wasn\\'t trying to get out of them) and she wasn\\'t sweating in them like she was in some others.  i would buy more of this brand if the clothes were a little cheaper.  she grows out of clothes so fast and to spend $31 again for more than 1 outfit would be a waste.  however, i might buy her another one in a different size as she gets bigger.  thank  you so much for thinking out of the box and realizing not all babies are born in the cooler weather. üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª delivered faster than expected! i\\'m 5.2 ft / 120 lbs and it fits just perfect. these pants looks so cool, exactly what i want! guess it\\'s gonna look even better with crop top... perfect sizes smaller than other brands. great product,light comfort for nighttime. i had a mix up with shipping with the company and took a long time to get item, but company offered to resend if it was never delivered. just got these, im 5\\'4 with a pretty decent butt size, these made it look great! but by bottom button hole was cut open lol...so i only have 2 button holes so im kinda mad about that.....idk how they could have forgotten to make a hole for the button to come through.. i was hesitant to get these since there was no feedback. but i am super glad i got them! they are great for the price! i am 5\\'3&#34; and 120 lbs and these fit just about perfect on me. if you are very tall, i think they may be too short for you though. the print and words on these are so cool! full of personality! love the fit.  will purchase from this vender again, and again.  thanks i love these pants. the fabric is great quality. i wear them to the gym regularly and would recommend them to anyone. i did have to shorten them a bit to accommodate my height but i\\'m slightly vertically challenged so that shouldn\\'t be a problem with the average person. very very thin material, couldn\\'t possibly wear out in public, and are also a somewhat slippy material but they fit perfectly and are absolutely adorable! my husband has fluctuating weight throughout the year.  these pants offer a hidden elastic band that allows for the fluctuations.  he wears them daily to work and will not wear any other casual work pant.<br /><br />they can be a bit pricey, i watch for good sales!! we\\'ve purchased several pairs of these coveralls - they\\'re favorites in our house. they\\'re soft, lightweight, and very cute. our younger daughter is wearing pairs handed down from our older daughter, and they\\'ve held up great after many, many washings. i\\'ve used oxyclean on them a couple of times without incident, though the color does fade, so i wouldn\\'t recommend that. highly recommend the coveralls though! glad that i finally got a great pair of super-roomy pants that people aren\\'t calling &#34;pajama pants&#34;.<br />hey, just because i sometimes crash in them... i bought this for my 9 month old and it fit better than i expected, washed and dried perfectly. the onsie is great around her chubby little legs ordered these for my daughter! she loves them! she wears them all the time. i will probably have to buy her some more! just as described, arived on time, great product. they are very  cute. lots of compliments. i ordered the pants in small first but they are very fitting - someone else might like this but i wanted pants that were a little loose.  so i ordered the medium and they suit me fine.  the material is very good. i chose them in black.  i like the fold over design and am happy with the pants. this is our second pair of these pants. we love them. high quality, great colors and we love the cuff at the bottom which keep my little one from tripping on his pants. we will order again once little man grows out of these. i love these pants! first pair i ordered i wish i would have ordered more because i loved them so much. they were out of stock when i went back to order more waited a month and when they were in stock again ordered 2 more pairs. they\\'re perfect stretchy pants. coming from someone who depends on comfort everyday! very comfotable nice sweatpants, the logo is larger than i thought it would be, so they look even better than i thought! these knee pants are comfortable as well as looking nice!  i bought them in four colors. these are the best fitting and most comfortable yoga pants i\\'ve ever owned! will be purchasing more! great fit. got the wrong size but the quality is amazing. very very high quality product, may never buy any other pants again. everything feels nice and it\\'s strong etc. nice. these condor stealth operator pants are good quality and look great! one of my female employees wanted a pair of these to wear while training our customers.<br /><br />the pants are comfortable and fit well but the best thing is the large number of  useful pockets!<br /><br />highly recommended!<br /><br />cfh my husband loves cargo pants and wears them for work as they have many pockets to keep items handy for him. there\\'s no tag, so you don\\'t know if you have them on backwards. and mine had a whole in the crotch. but what can i really expected for something that costonly $4 and had free shopping. i see nothing in the description to indicate where these pants were made. i\\'m guessing japan, china, taiwan, or maybe india.<br /><br />update: a man calling himself rick and claiming to be the owner of the company that makes these pants, comments that they are made in california. if rick is to be believed, that brings my rating up to 5 stars, for staying true to the ideal that these patriotic pants represent. hopefully, amazon will update the description to include this important information. i will now be adding another &#34;odd sizing&#34; comment to the list of reviews. i read many reviews saying this style ran a little large (due to the rope-belt) and was thinking of ordering a size up. in the end, i used the flat-belt measurement from some shorts i had that were a little tight on me. still, the pants were too big around the waist! they\\'re also very baggy around the legs and the only area where they are &#34;snug&#34; on me is around the &#34;posterior&#34;. since i like the pants and they are still wearable i will not be returning them :) i may order another pair one size down.<br /><br />i ordered medium and am 5\\'2&#34; and 120lbs great garment where little on long side but hem fixed the problem these are great pants.  they fit very well, the colors don\\'t fade and they don\\'t wear out. they have an inside adjustable waist. i am in love with these pants, the fit is perfect, the quality is better than i expected.<br />i have never purchased clothing online that was completely sight unseen other than a picture and two reviews for more than $30.00 so i really struggled with the decision to spend this much on a pair of pants. i ordered the extra small, i am 5 &#34;3  140 pounds i\\'ve had surgery so my normal weight is 120 to 125 and the extra small fits wonderfully and they will still fit when i\\'m back to myself. i am going to buy a pair in every color and two in my favorite colors. will definitely recommend this company and the clothing to my friends and family. love love love these pants. amazing fit . lifts my bum and very comfortable . the pants are great for fishing.  they dry fast and the legs can be zipped off when it gets warm.  i ordered size med.  i am 32/33 waist and 30 inseam.  the waist fit perfect, but the length was a little long.  the length was altered w/ no problem. these pants are of great quality--both fabric and construction. i wore them to death, and they looked great for a long time. they will, of course, hold up better if the instructions for hand washing are followed. the waist is extremely comfortable. all around an a+! oh, and btw, they make your legs look great through the thighs--an amazing feat! although these are pricey for yoga pants, they are my favorites. they provide good compression, but not too tight to see every curve and ripple. i wash them on cold, gentle and hang to dry. some fading but not much after a year of wear. kept their shape well. i love to wear mine on the beach and just stoll down looking for shells or something, the kids are hellereous, everyone points or does something, some have asked me not to stand so close to them, but i just love it. i bought these pants in 3 colors.  love them!  they do shrink some so buy up a size.  my 2 year old boy is 33 pounds and i bought a size 4 and after i washed them they fit perfect!  wish they came in more colors. only pants i will buy. wish they were slightly shorter the pants are lightweight, but that is o.k. for living in the south. it has alot of pockets, the color is cool and the price its right. i would recommend it to anyone. great. very good looking with a nice fit.  many compliments at yoga. excelent product ! thank you love them comfortable and fit as expected. when i ordered these, i fully expected them to be made from a light weight, kinda cheap fabric, but when i opened the package i was surprised to find them made from a fairly thick, heavy weight cotton blend. the quality seems to be of near mil-spec grade, but with one caveat.. the stitching down both legs has a lot of fraying from where the material was cut a little long. this won\\'t affect the pants in any way, but i will need to get out the scissors (or more likely, my pocket knife) and trim away all the stray threads. all in all, i am very happy with my purchase! awesome! this was more a lesson to me than anybody else. i bought this legging thinking it was more like a pair of pants (the image doesn\\'t look like a legging), so i was taken aback when i unwrapped my leggings. but at the end of the day, they are super cute and i cant wait to wear them. if want or need the ability to dissapear into the environment around then this is for you. the only draw back is the suite likes to collect sticks, thorn bushes ect... while u move through the wood. but other then that i would recomment it to anyone that is aq fan if theses siutes. very pretty. i got them for my friend for christmas and she absolutely loves them. her butt looks like space! not a whole lot to say about buttons. these plastic buttons match the ones on bdus (battle dress uniform) so are perfect for fixing up the jacket my dad gave me from his old time army days. it has seven buttonholes but only two buttons, so i was seriously in need of 5 olive colored buttons. these were such a good price, though, that i bought 100! what should i do with the other 95, i wonder? anyhow, you can never have enough buttons, so i guess i\\'m set for a while. love the pants~ they are very comfortable and arrived when i expected them.<br />material is not too thick, not too thin! very comfy, thick and warm. great for winter. perfect length. i love them! definitely recommend this product for teens and vertically challenged adults such as myself! remeber how hard it was to find comfortable pants when you were pregnant. well this were wonderful as soon as i put them on. soooo comfortable and fit just right. comfortable but thin fabric i like my pants a lot! they are light, comfortable and fit well. i do wish they were a little longer. also that the hang in the middle was just a tad bit deeper. but i really enjoy them i have used them for casual wear & taught my zumba class in them! more colors are needed! oh yeah & the waist band should lay flatter! i still love them though! üòäüëç unsure of fit as this is a christmas gift for my great nephew who lives in the yukon. i love the softness and colors.i\\'m sure they will be fine. i am five feet and 105 pounds.  these fit me great and are quite stretchy for bigger ladies. the waist band is not as tight as others i\\'ve gotten from this seller.  they are very soft, but a bit fuzzy on the inside, like fleece, so i don\\'t know that you\\'d want to wear these in humid heat.  i got them to wear on the plane for long flight, but have been throwing them on to run errands too, and they are extremely comfortable.  you can even go commando if you\\'re really in a rush. :) i love them. they are perfect and exactly what i was looking for. great product, especially a great price for such a good item. helps me sweat more as promised and keeps my body heat high and going. yet i\\'ve been noticing a bit of sweat seeping through around my bottom area, i\\'m not sure if that\\'s normal. keeps my body heat up until i shower. also, it took longer than expected to come i waited almost a month to receive it. these were too big when i purchased them. i knew they would be. i bought them that way. being made out of 100% cotton, i knew that washing and drying them, would cause them to shrink. they did. now, they fit perfectly. i love them. i\\'m wearing them right now. they are comfortable and breath well. i\\'ll be buying more and recommending them to others. fit nicely for me, i purchased a small/medium and i have a 34&#34; waist.  shipping was very fast.  i work at a renaissance festival and this will be nice for part of my second outfit. great quality pants. i intended to order them a little big but they were actually just a little snug. they still fit but would have bought next size larger if trying them on in the store. good. really cute jumper, but it\\'s a little big! love these pants! cannot wait to walk around the camp grounds in these this summer. lighter material, very comfortable! a great fit i love that fit just like high priced stretch pants. not too think and not at all thin. a great pair of stretch pants. i bought small for 120lbs 62 inch these are so cute and comfortable!! you can dress up or down with them. good quality. i ordered one size up and they fit great. alfred dunner is a reliable, high quality, consistent company. upon receipt of these slacks, i laid them, seam for seam, on top of a pair of the same size which is 12 to 15 years old. they matched exactly, down to the identical labels. very worthy of brand loyalty. these snow pants are very warm and wind resistant for very cold days. the only problem i had was that the very first time i tried adjusting the elastic cord, it pulled out from the waist.  i had to re-thread the cord and sew it into the pants. voila, good as new and it works. excelente very comfortable, design is great, and so it the price. i\\'m really glad i got these. amazon did not have my size, so i researched the company and purchased. i loooove these. they are exactly as pictured. they look and feel of high quality with being very light. the fit is flawless. will definitely shop for more of there products. i bought this as pajamas for my one year old grandson. soft, colorful and cute as a button. love them! but then my daughter tossed them into a load of wash with oxi clean (to remove baby stains), which ate holes in the bamboo fabric. they\\'re now swiss cheese. they should come with special washing instructions! but otherwise are delightful. for a men\\'s size pant, these fit surprisingly snug.  many other reviewers said that the pants were way too long, but as a 5\\'3&#34; girl with short legs, the length of the pants are fine on me.  i am a fairly slim girl and they fit snug around the thigh/butt area... maybe because they\\'re meant for men?  when i received them, there was a hole in the pocket, but it wasn\\'t a big enough deal to send them back, i can just stitch it up.  overall, i like the pants a lot. this item is a light weight materal not so light that you can see through it but light enough for extra confort. i am 5\\'8 and pants are hard to find that are long and stay long after washing. these pants remained in fantastic condition after washing.  these are very confortable pants that i would recomend to anyone. i will be purchasing another pair. i was looking for footed pants because my 1 year old always pulls his socks off, and he needed his feet covered when its coold and wintery. i love these pants, they are soft and comfy and i love the colors.<br />however, for going outside in the winter you need another layer. also, i admit the feet can be a little troublesome when baby is learning to walk because there is no grip. wasn\\'t too much of a problem though. a little long. i love them. they are great for warmer weather. i love the pants had to fight to get in them but i love them awesome!!! fits prerfect on 5\\'4/128 very nice material light n cozy n sexy as well love these jeggings. comfortable. only one recommendation for the manufacturer .... make the pocket lining the same color as the pants. since these are snug fitting the pocket lining should match the pants color love but don\\'t wash it at all i bought these pants at a store in tallahassee for my son where he could try them on,  he loves the pair he bought and asked for a black pair to wear with certain color combinations he likes.  glad to oblige.  i\\' m a mother who aims to please! just as expected great price for these jeans!  fast shipping! fit really well cute and just what i wanted these are the only nursing pants so far that have fit me so well,  i have a boytype body with small hips and they really compliment my body.  i would have given a 5 if they didn\\'t shrink and wrinkle so much.  i would keep buying because they fit the best. excellent excellent products i\\'m 5\\'3, 115 pounds, and almost 14 weeks pregnant. i ordered size small. these pants are very comfy!! they are a bit snug on the butt and thigh section, but that doesn\\'t bother me since it helps them stay up. yoga pants are usually expensive-these are good price, and very worth it! i did hem them up, but short girls usually have to do that :-)<br /><br />update!<br />i wear these on a daily basis. turns out my hem job wasn\\'t needed-they were perfect length for my height of 5\\'3&#34;. very comfy pants! i have washed them 2-3 times since owning them, and mine have snugged back up after wash & dry-which is nice since they do stretch out a tiny bit. i would recommend them. i am now 18 weeks pregnant, and they are the only pants i wear in public since i don\\'t currently own maternity jeans. size small works perfect for my 117 lb body.<br /><br />update again!!<br />these yogas are great for pregnancy, as well as daily wear. i have been wearing these daily since i bought them back in january. i\\'m now almost 23 weeks pregnant, about 130 lbs, and size small is still fitting me :-) they do snug back up after wash/dry, but i like that. i ordered yogas from another retailer on amazon.com, and these ones are better! quality of pants isn\\'t better, but stretchy wise and comfort ability-way better!! they are thin. i guess i didn\\'t read the fabric info. but  they do fit and feel good. it is so soft. t-party makes a high quality yoga pant for a very affordable price.  i have five pairs.  they fit me perfectly. i just received these as a christmas present, and i don\\'t ever want to take them off. they\\'re really soft and a little stretchy, on the thinner side (which is perfect for my preferences). as a girl, i rejoice in pajama pants that actually have pockets, so yay!<br /><br />fit info:<br />i\\'m a girl, 5\\'0&#34; tall, typically wear size 7-9 in jeans. i ordered a small, and i had to roll the waist twice to keep them from being too long (or i could just hem them, but then there\\'d be all that extra crotch room...)-- but thus rolled, they\\'re the perfect length. they also fit perfectly through the hips and thighs-- which says something, as i\\'m pear-shaped/bottom heavy. if you\\'re slender in the leg/hip region, these pants may be baggy for you.<br /><br />quality info:<br />the material is soft, and of decent quality. the seams are well-sewn and don\\'t seem like they\\'ll be coming apart any time soon. the tiny button on the fly is firmly attached. the decal/letters on the left leg are of good quality, with no hints that they\\'ll erode despite the slight stretchiness of the fabric.<br /><br />overall:<br />5/5, exactly what i was looking for! i\\'ll wear these pj pants with slytherin pride :d super fast shipping great product!!! look just like the pic great value for the price! so much better than pullups that\\'s for sure! these are amazingly comfortable. i bought my boyfriend and i matching pairs we love them so much to lounge around in. so soft wish they made these in other colors! love them, just what i needed.. do they come in smaller sizes so soft abs great quality i love these pants but the fabric is a bit see through on the sun. they are extremely comfortable we love kickee pants.  they are soft, very stretchy, and fit my quickly growing daughter from 5-10 months without problems (probably would have kept fitting, but we didn\\'t try!).  they also dry very quickly.  they are pricey but we were able to get our money\\'s worth out of them.  they have some very cute patterns too! sizing is right on.  looks great.  i have only washed and worn them once, but seems well put together.  i would buy this again. i just love these. they fit as expected. i\\'m under 5ft  and weight 115.and the length is right. they look very well with the sakka tops. they wash well. if you also exercise or attend yoga they are perfect. i bought them in size small.if u are shorter an extra small will fit .i purchased 4 of these. price is right for item. i\\'ve purchased these in every color and pattern they make! they are a huge hit from age 23 to 53! very soft and comfortable! soft and warm. nice for wear around the house. textured material. i love them too. i wanted green but it was sold out so i picked red. i can\\'t wait until more are available! had to squeeze it over my hips but once i pulled it up past my waist, perfect fit-made for me. runs small, however; if you get it too big, the waist-torso area may be a little loose. i love them! the quality is good for it\\'s price and the fit was perfect. i\\'ll only be wearing this jeans sometimes and in the winter because it\\'s summer in florida and it\\'s hot. lol. but this was a great purchase i got what i expected and the shippin was sublime. i am a pretty petite woman and i feel like every pair of scrubs i purchase is way too big, even when i follow the fitting chart and order smalls/extra smalls but this adar junior fit flare pants fit amazing! i also purchased the junior fit scrub top to go with it and it too fits awesome! (i ordered a small in the juniors sizes) -- i also really liked the fabric that was used, i don\\'t feel comfortable in scrubs that are really starched or stiff so i was even happier when i put these scrubs on and the fabric was super comfy but still great quality. i was also impressed at how quick my order came (well before the estimated arrival date) -- the only thing is, i wish they offered more colors in this specific style/size. other than that, super pleased with adar! i love this product.  it really makes you sweat!  i read some bad reviews and i\\'m glad i bought the product anyway.  if you want to sweat then this pants are for you. matches the blooms - fashion gothic visual punk rock unisex shirt, and i just need to lose about 10lbs.  but this outfit is awesome!!!! washes well, but there will be a little shrinkage.  i allowed for that when i purchased. these pants are super cute and they fit very nicely. they are comfortable and stylish. i am 5\\'6&#34; and the length on them was just sweeping the floor in flats. i would recommend these pants to anyone interested in purchasing them! great pair of pants. comfortable, and looks good as well. i needed a little tailoring in the waist, but that was no problem. after taking out an inch, the pants were perfect. i wear them for just a casual look, they\\'re much better than jeans. i highly recommend this purchase to others. nice. this product is wonderful and fit perfect.  i will be reordering more in the future.  there hasn\\'t been any leaks so sheets stay dry. i will admit, i\\'m picky about how yoga pants fit. these fit exactly how i expected; how it looks on the model.<br />they are snug around my knees but flare out enough to look cute around shoes.<br />they are, however, a bit long. i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; and the size small drag on the ground, all i do is fold at the seam and it\\'s just enough to not drag.<br />in rainy weather thought, this could be annoying.<br />i have a 5\\'8&#34; friend that got the mediums and they fit her perfect without being to short or dragging.<br />they are thin and light, very stretchy, but if they stretch too much they become a little see through (just don\\'t get a smaller size than usual and their perfect)<br />the fold-over waistband is actually long enough to cover half or most you but and crotch.<br />this can be adjusted depending on how you wear them.<br />yoga pants by nature are form fitting and i hate it when they ride up your crotch and everyone can see.<br />these actually have a fairly long folder-over!<br />these are my favorite yoga pants, both the flare and the tight style!<br />they have tons of colors but only some are offered at a time.<br />i didn\\'t like any of the colors offered at first and waited a week and they had new ones!<br />i recommend! definitely recommend  great quality great fir. comfortable,  thin and relaxing.  however it shows in the picture of a wider sash......that would have been a 5 star very sexy! just got these badboys, very comfortable, deep pockets so i can hold all of the chewing tobacco and eagle eggs i want liked how theyfit and very comfortable looooove it i have not worn them yet but they look good on...kind of baggy in the crotch but nice anyway. will buy another pair! fits amazing and shows off what curves i have! glad my hubby ordered this for me, i will definitely consider buying more! i love the way these fit - very complimentary and totally adorable. true to size! this was a good buy! this was a gift and the recipient loves it. these are perfect for kids that have some random accident and are starting to wear underpants instead of diapers. soft, hold the pee, fit as expected, durable. great product. i love these pants!!!! really nice material and hemmed like jeans at the bottom.  they are a bit long ( i am 5\\'7&#34;) but i would rather have a bit long than too short. i got the purple and they are really cool and unique. awesome just received my order omg these pants are awesome. not too tight not too loose. i was afraid they were going to be high waters but they were long enough. i got a medium because i was afraid the small would be too small. medium was the perfect fit. i love these jeans would recommend these jeans to anyone. the material of the jeans is like the dickies jean\\'s material.  i weight 104lbs and my height is 5\\'1 and a medium was a good fit for me. i purchased the 18 months-24 months size for my 9 month old son who weighs 23 lbs.  he currently uses the 12 month size and it is a bit tight.  the 18 months - 24 months is perfect for him, and there is still some room for him to grow into.  the bamboo viscose material is so soft.  i highly recommend this item for your child.  it is worth the price. i purchased this to go under a blue dress to cover her diaper for a wedding my daughter was in at 16 months old.  they were a little pricey, but so incredibly soft! she wore them quite a bit under other ourfits, too.  very well made, nice soft fabric, and shipped pretty quickly, too. nice quality. the material was a bit heavier than i\\'d hoped but the pants will be very comfortable in most seasons except summer. great item.  looks great on my girl.  not particularly great for out in public as they are see through somewhat. i bought these to wear in the hospital after i have my daughter.i have to have a csection so i wanted something comfortable and not too tight around my incision. these are great! i wore similar yoga pants when i had my first child. they are perfect if you want to be dressed in your own clothes, but dont want to worry about jeans. this is my second pair.  they are a little long but i can wear with heels and they are fine.  i am 5\\'3\\\\\\\\\" and 160 lbs.  they fit my frame nicely. very nice and soft, my kind of slack, they would work for many occassions, wish there were more colors to choose from i love these they fit perfect! gonna order two more i love it love them this is a good quality pants. however, the size is a little larger than our us size. i ordered the size based on my 32/30. the pants that i got have larger waist. therefore, you may consider order a size slightly smaller than your usual waist size. the quality of the pants is great. my 4 year old daughter loves it! the fabric is so soft and she loves wearing it.  great product for the price. i give this one an a+<br /><br />when i ordered this i was a little skeptical, thankfully i took a chance and went with my gut. i wore it out for my birthday and all eyes were on me.... and to top it off it\\'s very inexpensive, came in the mail a week or two later. signed up for a bellydance class and wasn\\'t sure if i\\'d like it, so didn\\'t want to make much of an investment in my costume. these are versatile and a great value. wore them to an all-day hoop-dance festival w/ no damage or tears... surprisingly durable for $10 pants! i\\'m hard on my clothes when i dance; i\\'ve had pants rip and shoes break on me. easily dressed-up w/ a coordinating coin-belt for bellydance. size - i\\'m a fairly petite adult, about 5\\'4 and 115 lbs, 38\\' around the widest part of my hips... these pants fit fine. the fabric will stretch a lot, but heavier-set ladies may want to find something in a larger size. very comfortable and for the price, i may order more pairs. :) great pants. kinda tight in the thigh area. i generally wear a size 9 or 11 in jeans, so i ordered these in an 11 to play it safe. they fit perfectly in the legs (i prefer a more fitted fit through the thigh), but buttoning them wasn\\'t even a close possibility. my husband ordered a new pair for me in a 13 and they are significantly larger than the 11\\'s were. it\\'s not too much of an issue, because they still look alright, but the 13 is somewhat baggy in the legs and a little loose in the waist. if i could combine the legs of the 11\\'s and the waist of the 13\\'s, i\\'d have a perfect pair of work pants. despite the odd sizing, they are comfortable, well-constructed, and a great value. 2 months later, they have not faded, worn out, or lost their shape. these pants are never constricting of my repetitive movements - tons of walking, bending, and crouching. i work in a retail store, and i am never off of my feet. i love that these are stretchy and move with me, yet they keep their shape during my entire shift. i highly recommend these for women who have active occupations, just beware of the possible sizing issues - use your best judgement. looks really nice, the fit is great and looks cute and trendy. i love that it is high waisted too. have been looking for the right \\\\\\\\\"long underwear\\\\\\\\\" for some time.  these are perfect for midwest winters. i have now washed them many times in the washing machine and dried in the dryer and they are still just perfect.they have maintained their shape and size. actually, i wash them in warm water rather then the cold specified on the label. when i first took them out of the packaging i was surprised to see how long they were from the crotch to the waistband but it turned out they fit just fine.  i can either roll them over the waistband of my long pants or jeans or just pull them up my torso and that keeps me even warmer. now, one would not find these appropriate for serious winter sports but if you are going outside to do things like walking your dog, going outside to take the garbage, or shoveling snow, these will fit the bill. in fact, i find myself wearing them much of the time in the house to keep warm.  they fit well under blue jeans and regular dress pants. i am a fan of this brand now and will order more. they are very soft, comfortable, and lightweight,  very pleased with these well constructed thermal underwear. the pants at first were not quite what i thought they would be. they were quite long and i\\'m not short so for hem to be a good 4 to 5 inches long on me was a bit annoying. that being said they are super comfortable i wear them with my boots mostly. they are nice and slimming. they were a good price for what i got and i was pretty happy. comfortable beautiful sexy pants. this pants are making me feel gorgeous. i am 5,2 inch tall and 130 pounds the end of the second trimester and have short lags. this skinny pants are making me sexy even thoug my bally is big and notecible. love them, made for me! love \\'em! they matched my costume i bought them for perfectly. great suit, fit as expected. perfect for business wear. always buy is full size and quality material i work out a lot and i love these. super comfortable, highly breathable, look awesome........<br /><br />i had no problems with shrinking and no problems with delivery or color selections.<br /><br />just ordered another 2 pairs i bought these shorts for a halloween costume and now i use them as underwear or shorts for around the house they\\'re great !!!!! these pants are great! much better than the expensive zumba branded ones. they are high enough in the rise that they\\'re not always slipping down or muffin topping you. lightweight and soft, easy to move in. design is good, execution is a bit off. lots of loose threads to trim. love the pockets and lots of them. rides well with a full load. fit great! i have ordered another pair if your looking for cool chachimamas for cheep these are the ones.<br />they could be a little tighter around the calf\\'s though you would think i had a typo there but seriously, i have the button but no hole. they are still very comfortable and stylish. love the soft material. a little snug around waist , but fits great ... love this baby pants! luvable friends has great inexpensive clothes for babies! i<br />love the colors and the fabric. not too cold or hot! it fits perfetc perfect fit and very comfortable i expected these to run long on me cuz there wasnt a petite choice but they are actually a better length on me than others i got that actually were petite. very comfy too. ready for the next winter. fits comfortably. i needed a pair of these in brown, which was not easy to find any where in any store i went to. this was a great price for the quality!! they were exactly what i was looking for. very happy with this purchase. ok, so one pair did get a teeny tiny hole in the crotch almost immediately. and i read the other reviews so i\\'ve been hanging them all to dry. that being said, the tiny hole was an easy fix. $12 for super comfy lounge/yoga pants, i\\'m sold! i\\'m 5\\'8&#34; and they are a tad long but i don\\'t mind. if i did, my tailoring lady only charges $2.99 for hemming so it\\'d be an easy fix if i wanted it. all in all, worth trying for the price! i had ordered one in the spring and loved how comfortable this was and how it goes from beach wear to dinner with just adding a jacket or long scarf that i\\'ve purchased another 2 and will very possibly buy the olive color one just to have another. i am a larger woman though short and this jumpsuit still looks great on my small wide frame. the comfort is amazing, i would also suggest this as a maternity garment where comfort is key! nice!!!! size on point! i got the black and grey pair for the gym and lounging. gotta say that these are really cute and the material is not cheap despite the price. they look just as pictured and hug your body in a very flattering way. i am 5\\'7 and a size four, and i bought both colored leggings and a black pair. i got them in medium since the reviews say that they run small, and thank god i did. i work out a lot, so i do have an ass, but these are tight! the weird thing is that the black ones are a different brand than the others, and are almost so tight that i had to return them. so just be aware of that. that being said, i do like these. the colors are really fun, and my legs look awesome. look forward to a larger selection. i love them. they fit great! they fit so great my 16 yr old daughter wanted a pair. what i love the most is the lengh. longer then most yoga pants. cute love these they are great! they\\'re really long but i\\'m only 5\\'1 so i cut them but they\\'re really comfortable and fit nice these pants fit great. i am a size 14 and they look wonderful. the waist is elastic which allows for more room. great pair of pants...well done. the only thing is that the tight part will not stay up! i made it stay...i sewn an elastic between the seems and our opera singer (papageno) was able to were it in magic flute.<br /><br />very nice material! perfect! adorable no snapping needed with changing diapers - still wearing them at nightime with the air-conditioning on! these jeans really perk up a flat butt.. they are comfortable and fit great. i ever dreamed i could get good quality jeans for less than 100$ i did order assize up and they fit perfectly. i have since ordered 2 more pairs. love love love them. good by joes jeans and hello u turn butt lifting jeans! good item and fast delivery service thanks with about 20 pr. of jeans i haven\\'t been able to wear for a few years, i now have a whole wardrobe of pants and jeans of my favorites. all this thanks to the waistband stretcher. this device works amazingly well and is robust enough to last a long time. most of the pants are 36 inch waist to fit a 40 inch waist. as long as the waist is the only problem......this thing works!!! perfect, lets see how they hold up after frequent washing ...so far i love them. the beholder of this gift was delighted with the fit and quality of this gift.  she was wearing them when we called her on christmas day. i love it thank you a little shorter than we like but fits good. great product. looks exactly the same as shown. it is very stylish and matches my other shirt so i can also pair it with my chucks knee high shoes really like the way they fit.  not slouchy or bulky but not too tight. very slimming. very good quality,fits just perfect,right to size,and deep purple color looks amazing,and looks expensive,i love it and defitinetely recommended!!!thanks for wonderful seller! i have a few rolls on m back (fat), other than that it fits well and i have worn it a few times already! these were our annual christmas pj\\'s for myself and grandchildren.  all the sizes were right on, and they are the most comfortable leisure pants i have ever had, they are so cute. best american made chinos i have found so far.......<br />they are holding up so far.<br />this supplier sold them reasonably the fabric is smooth, and they\\'re warm (ok under jeans for outdoor temps down to 20f/-7c or so) but thin so that my legs don\\'t feel hot when wearing them indoors. my only complaint is that even \\\\\\\\\"small\\\\\\\\\" size has very long legs and is baggy on me (i\\'m 5\\'3\\\\\\\\\", 105lbs or 160cm, 48kg). younger women like me and teenage girls also may not like the old-lady high waist peeking out of their pants. these are awesome!!! i think a bit pricey so i will have to space my purchases,but everything on the website is awesome!!! i would love to have these in every color!!! these pants are worth the price.  the linen is sturdy but lightweight, pockets are well-placed, the fit is flattering, and they\\'re extremely comfortable with great freedom of movement.  i can tell these are going to be my favorite summer pants--they\\'re so breezy!  already i want more of them in different colors.<br /><br />i took off one star because the length is shorter (on me) than what\\'s shown in the photo.  i\\'m 5\\'7&#34; and the hems are at mid-calf on me.  no biggie, but the length on me is more like newsboy pants than harem pants. love these pants! super light, great for summer! thank you these are so cute and will look great with any type of top. i plan to wear them out when im feeling flirty!!! love it these are good for training, once your child has an idea of what they should be doing. they are thicker then normal undies, but not as thick and absorbent as other training pants i have bought. they wash up well. my only real issue with these are that although the size itself seems to be ok, the leg holes were very small. not only where they snug around my little one\\'s legs, but this made it very hard to get them off when they were wet. softest leggings i\\'ve ever had! i would only recommend this product for those with long sweaters or shirts because you can see through the back and your underwear are very visible. the are comfortable and cut if you wear them right though. :) the length were a bit too tall. like everything from po, this terry outfit is soft and durable. surprisingly soft for terry. most terry is kinda scratchy and this sooo soft. i can\\'t wait to use it this summer at the beach. it looks soooo cute on my daughter. i love these  thank you a bunch a little pricey for a printed shirt but it\\'s exactly what i wanted. good product. adorable footy pants, great to extend onesie\\'s into the fall. these pants are strictly for working-out situations only. please refrain from using them in any non-work-out related activity. i cannot stress this enough. i do not work for the manufacturer. i am only concerned about the well being of potential american-flag-workout-gym-pants wearing civilians. love this sweats. fit nicely, great cut, modern and also wears off nice after so many washes. shipped quickly. thank you. good and look good as well. i wear size small (women\\'s) but i ordered the largest size available and they fit perfect! the waist is a little wide though but it sits beautifully on my hips! the material is a little lighter than sweats but heavier than most knits... i do love them. great! looks good and very comfortable. i was worried that the sizing would be weird, but they fit just fine. they\\'ve been through the wash and they still fit great. i really do like this brand. love these!, there\\'s just something about how yoga pants fit and these meet my expectations. definitely would recommend these to all girls. :) great! love these jeans!!!! i ordered my normal size, and they fit perfect (for my liking), some might think that they are a little big, but i don\\'t like my pants to be skin tight. i could get a size down and they would fit as well. i got a size 9 and i\\'m 5\\'9&#34; and 160 lb.<br />i definitely want more! nice shorts for the money a great! fits just right arrived on time have got lots of compliments on the when i where them, would recommend them to a coworker these are great, soft and comfy and thin so they can be worn probably year round. i really love them! given the somewhat mixes reviews, i was reluctant to purchase these pants.  given the price, i figured i would give them a shot. i\\'m so glad i did!  i\\'m petite (5\\'5\\\\\\\\\") and the length is perfect. i wore them for workouts on and off for 2 weeks and i did not experience any \\\\\\\\\"pilling\\\\\\\\\" between the thighs. they washed beautifully. in fact, mine still look new!  the seller delivered the pants quickly, too! all in all, this was a great deal! they are the most comfortable pants in the world. fits as expected, but if you\\'re short like me, you\\'ll need to get them hemmed! overall i really love them! if a woman buys, buy a size smaller than usual size love them, so comfy and very trendy!!  the entire night i got complements on them! fit was perfect, i usally wear a 8-10 and 5\\'6.. i got a large because i knew they wouldn\\'t have my stretch!!! i knew when ordering that they\\'d run bigger and that\\'s why i bought them....so soft..love organic baby clothes because the fabric gives for room to grow! this is a super soft, very well crafted blanket. our baby boy loved it. he cuddles with every night on his dleep! amazing leggings felt like diva when i first try them on very well made and good quality . awesome nice cords but heavy and run a tad small, will do at a inch but color just a bit too dark for the olive i really wanted but still good, a bit overpriced but ok. very good quality and extremely comfortable bought these for my twins. size 3-6 mo. they do run a little bigger because they stretch out so much.     overall, they are good pj pants and very cute. i love these. they are incredibly comfi, yet, don\\'t fall off. super adjustable and soft. best buy ever. really great. a little bit big, but it is comfortable exactly what i was looking for skiing and even snomobiling through snow! they are somewhat flexible which allows them to be snug but also perfect for athletic needs. love these pants, they are a little too long, i will have to hem them, but its really hard to find a long inseam in stores. super cute design and i will definitely wear them but i am thick through the belly and these slide down a bit on me. perfect!!! good fit awesome quality & fit it was adorable, very well made. they\\'re great quality pants but the garter at the bottoms around the ankles that keep snow out are not very tight. but otherwise, they\\'re great. fits true to size 29l was about 2 inches too long. i purchased this t shirt for a gift and it came quickly and is of excellent quality.  thanks amazon. the colors are nice and looks just like the picture.  easy to match with almost any solid tshirt/top. will fit well on a tall and lean person.  i am 5.9 and the lenght is perferct!

love these! what a great deal, and fit is great.  if winter continues as it is starting-i need to order about 7 more pair.  thanks for great deal :-0 i\\'m a plus size girl who wears anything from 1x to 3x... was nervous these harems might not fit... put them on and fell in love!  so cute, so comfy, so flattering and they are giving you fashion! these are wonderful, fit perfect. i need a pair black, do they have in black???<br /><br />i like all the colors exactly what you want to be wearing when you give someone a roundhouse kick to the head. one of the best lingerie items we bought online highly recommended.. very smooth very sexy it is a good product, this stylish, necessary detallees the only time it takes to get products and that the page is in another language, should be accessible to any language these drop crotch pants are too dang cute. i bought them for my androgynous boyfriend, who is 5\\'9 and they were a wee bit too short, but they fit my 4&#34;11 slender frame perfectly. this was definitely designed with petite people in mind. very good comfy.  flattering.  i\\'m 5\\'4&#34; and needed to have them hemmed, taking about 6&#34; off the bottom, but other than that they made awesome beach pants for a caribbean vacation. these are too cute and comfortable, they\\'re everything i expected! these are true to size. they are super comfy and soft and can be worn casual with flats or dressy with heels. love them i ordered this is black and one in burgundy.  absolutely love these harem pants and cannot wait to wear them. i bought these yoga pants without knowing anything about the company.  now i know they\\'re made in the u.s.a..  the seams are welt seams, strong.  they\\'re comfortable.  i\\'m wearing them now!  and ... i\\'ll probably buy more. i received these pants to day and i\\'m very impressed!  they fit like a glove.  lots of pockets and the stitching is very well done.  i\\'m 6\\'1 and slim(140 lbs).  i order the 30x32 and they fit great. very happy! order now! i bought a couple pair in both gender styles and am very happy! sizing looks right on, they\\'re organic, and adorable... these leggings are phenomenal they\\'re sexy & fit well! looove it! wash before first use unless you like the new material smell. love this pajama pants.  very very soft. these pants are incredible.  i wore them to a  reggae and wine festival and they were such a hit.  i don\\'t think i\\'ve gotten more compliments on a single item of clothing before.  i\\'m 5\\'9. 145 lbs and they fit me perfectly. love love love the way these scrubs fit. it is very hard to find scrubs in a xxs in a junior fit. this is a low cost way to do cloth diapers.  been using these since my daughter was born and haven\\'t had a problem.<br /><br />just make sure to not put them in they dryer if you wash them. fits exactly how i like, a little long in the legs but i have long legs so that\\'s just perfect! loved these!!!!! i have a hard time finding my length in the stores, so going online is really my only option.  i hate carrying my wallet in my back pocket when i don\\'t have to, so the front pockets are great.  i enjoy the fit of wrangler also. when i wear them as pants, they look more like long capris, than pants. the model shown is average size, i guess. i was a bit disappointed because i did buy the long pants, not the average ones, and they\\'re still a bit too short for me. i\\'ll wear them anyway of course. just wish they had been long enough. looking good i love this as a set with the long sleeve top.  i have bought these wholesale for printing our company logo for merchandise before and have purchased from here plain.  they are so soft and comfy on the little ones.  great for lounging around and pj\\'s i love these way better than my victoria\\'s secret pairs! i bought the same ones in pink now too(:  not see through at all, and has a great waistband.  the length is perfect for me as well! (i\\'m 5\\'5\\\\\\\\\" and i bought a small) i really wanted to try these because they looked so hardy.  they are strong, comfortable and definitely \\\\\\\\\"old school.\\\\\\\\\"  if you know any military history, these are akin to the originals from the 1940\\'s.  the twill is 8.5-9oz. most twill in khakis these days is 5-7oz.  these sit low on my hips as a tall girl and i love being able to get a longer length.  there is a removable dogtag with \\\\\\\\\"union force\\\\\\\\\" etched on it that hangs from one of the front belt loops---nice touch and really cool! arrived on time & fit beautifly! i love it so i bought these because one i needed like a shorts alternative, something for long shirts, and leggings are too long and do not look good on me. i am 5\\'4 and these work so great. i just received them and didn\\'t want to take them off after i tried them on. i took off one star because by the picture it looks like it has a full panel cover for your belly, but the elastic fits nicely under my  belly and is not restricting at all. so comfortable and i will definitely wear these long after baby comes because they are the perfect length. i thought these were perfect but recently my daughter has been complaining that they are too tight. she\\'s a short and skinny 26 lb girl and we use the 2t-3t size as recommended. i like everything else about the diapers i just wish they weren\\'t so tight around her waist. these are really cute. the inseam is a little smaller than expected. otherwise they fit as i would expect them too. this product is true to size. no sagging. very nice to pair with everyday tops. the wide waist band acts as a girdle which is a plus ladies! super cute. very lightweight. as expected these are great pants.  a little wide at the bottom, because i prefer a very straight leg, but very comfortable and nice fit, true to size.. my son is happy, is what i wanted, the size fitted perfectly, good material, high quality, the color is perfect, i recommend a bit baggy, but oh,  so soft! comfy and cheerful, help let go of the day\\'s stress, for a relaxing  night. my look in a nutshell!<br />love these so much i bought them in both blk and olive.<br />dress them up, wear them to teach (dance), run to the store..whatever.<br />i, personally, don\\'t wear them as rompers but as pants.<br />great price. i love this garment.  it\\'s the best thing in my closet right now. very very comfortable and airy. i would reccommend it to everyone, however, i don\\'t want everyone to have it. lol good material these little pants are adorable. there is loved baby on the seat of the pants. simply adorable.  my niece just loved them. i love these pants........my mom is 4\\'8 and has a hard time finding pants to fit in length.........these are a tad bit long but not like what we usually get........they fit fairly well i have been looking for the perfect pair of black pants and this is it! its a little lower than a high waist pair of pants, but it feels great on the legs and on my butt. i do not think it is butt lifting, but i honestly only bought it because the waist looked so pretty. these yoga pants were nice and thick material, i didn\\'t have to worry about my skin showing through at all.  the large were nice and long and i could even wear them with heels.  i have 5\\'7&#34; it is beautiful pants just consider size due it comes with elastic so you can be smaller in  this pants,  consider one size small. i got so many compliments on these! i adore them, wore them the very day i got them! so insanely comfy and soft. i just purchased both this atta pant and a racerback top. i do a lot of yoga and needed a new pair of yoga pants they are super comfy and i like that the waist does not stop short. the top i bought just because i thought it was cute, and i was right i love the way it looks and feels. i love the detail on the back.<br />i love these pants so much i just might buy another pair today! i am in love w them. comfy and love that they have pockets!! i just got these pants today.  they seem well made and the fabric isn\\'t thin.  the description says they\\'re for juniors, but they fit really well, even though i don\\'t exactly have a junior body.  the fold over waist is nice because you can wear them as high or as low as you want.  i normally wear an 8 or 10 and ordered a large.  super comfy!  i will be ordering more. this was a gift for my daughter and she loves it! soft and warm, cute pattern (owls) and the size fit as expected.  the pant legs were a little long but that was easily resolved by hemming them.  better too long than too short.  great buy!  two thumbs up!  wish they had a matching top! this purchased is a little bit mystery, i contacted the seller and they said is not available yet but surprisingly it arrived yesterday.<br /><br />anyways, this is a perfect jumpsuit i ever have i\\'ve been buying in different brand, style & stores but this one is excellent in everything, the material is too thin and comfy perfect attire for tropical island i live, the fitting is excellent too though it is too long for me but it\\'s easy to cut and what amazed me is that you don\\'t need to sew.<br /><br />everything is perfect sure i will buy all colors for this but not now yet maybe in 2-3 months after. and already recommend to my friend.. i love my marijuana leggings they are to large but it is something i can deal with and i have delt with. i ordered a large due to a review saying thy we\\'re true to size and when i got them they appeared to be a small. they are stretchy so i decided to keep them because, i like their look and they\\'re very soft. beautiful garment, yet it was a present, and it did not fit at all my friend\\'s body shape. she is 5 f2, very sporty and muscular. i  she likes to feel free , elegant yet not \\'\\'cute&#34; or \\'preppy\\'. she loved  the pants to look at it. when she put it on, she looked shorter and larger, not at all the fit she was hoping for.!! very sorry, truly sorry ! fun tights for a fun little girl.  these were purchased for my wild child who happens to be an adventure time fan.  they fit well and are a decent quality. (5\\'5&#34; and 112 lbs)  i recommend turning them inside out for a delicate machine wash cycle and hang to dry.  don\\'t expect these leggings to last forever, they are thin and will get a run or hole eventually.  i expect them to last just about as long as her interest in wearing them does.  she has worn them to school once and playing with friends once and they are still in tact so i feel we\\'ve already gotten our money\\'s worth! cute ordered a large one it\\'s more like a medium liked the material, very comfortable. i have never worn leggings or leather-look pants of any kind but needed some for a costume. i was impressed with the quality and comfort. very comfortable, will be wearing around the house i\\'ve bought these jeans before. i love them they are super comfortable. i feel like i\\'m wearing soft yoga pants.  the only drawback is they are a little warm for hot summer days as most jeans are.  i wish they came in black. i love these pants for my son! he is a very big boy and if you have a dislike for trying to wrangle baby socks on your child, then these are prefect.plus the fabric is so soft and washes up well.i just wish they came a bit bigger since my 20 pound four month old will not be able to wear the largest size much longer. pants for well. length is perfect and i\\'m 5&#34;8. they are a little sheer so you have to wear a long shirt to cover your backside if you wear them to the gym these capri\\'s run a little small but they are super cute. be careful when you wash them, and do not dry! the material is sooooo soft its comfortable and fits as expected. i am 5\\'3 1/2 and 105 pounds and i ordered a small and its not tight, it fits just right. is a better pants you can buy in your life!! really good! propper = excellent! love them. i was very pleased with this purchase.  the sweat pants are very durable and hold up as far as color after washing. perfect fit & comfortable. used to run 1/2 marathon in. for what i need these pants for they look great!...what i really like about them is that i can where them over any pair of regular pants and the still look good..they just fit right over them., i was apprehensive about buying jeans online, im always finicky with the sizes... but these fit like a glove! the little bit of stretch makes them comfortable and they look great. amazing deal! i bought these for my little sister for christmas and she lives in them now. it\\'s very soft material, the drawstring has a nice satin-y feel, and the elephants are adorable. would have given 5 stars but the pants are way too long; they drag the floor.  i will keep them and intend to have them hemmed.  i don\\'t recall the size i ordered, but i am 5\\'5&#34;.  i like the material and the flow when dancing. perfect and comphy just the best for the best i love my pants and put a couple more pair in my wishlist.  i am trying to talk myself out of getting a few more pair, but most likely i will get more before they sell out!  i like them so much i almost want to put a 1 star so that no one else buys any. i love these pants!  why is it so hard to find footed pants as separates (not packaged as an outfit).  i really do love these pants for my little boy.  i felt that the were a little big for 0-3 months but my baby is a little on the smaller side length wise.  he\\'s almost 4 months now and is over 14lbs and these fit him fine.  he has shorter legs, but they do fit nice around the waist.  i also ordered 3-6 months for him to grow into over the next month or so.  figured they would get us through the colder months. my granddaughter loves these capris. glad i bought her medium. even though she is only 5 foot and weighs 110 pounds, she would not have been able to wear a size small as her belly expands. will purchase more of these in different colors. great for hanging around in the house. i purposely got the pants to large. i we live in alaska and sometime i have to double up on my baby\\'s clothes when we go out. nd they are so darn cute i want her to be able to use them longer than just a month. babies are always growing to fast. they are perfect ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è i loved these pants.  i was very surprised how well it fit.  usually these types of pants are too short for me.  i am quite tall.  but it fit like a glove and it was long enough.  my girlfriend saw it and immediately bought one. thank you, i am satisfied with my purchase. awesome, worked great for my victorian costume.  not easy to use the bathroom in but manageable. i wanted martini glasses that were not so fragile and these were exactly what i wanted.  they were stable and nice looking. excellent buy!<br />great fit! fast shipping and great product. i love them. i originally left a review of this product a few weeks back. the product is of excellent quality and did not fit right. the waste band is not a very flexible material. i have to give an a+ for the customer service though. they have got back to my review and offered partial money back for the product not fitting correctly. they also are going to be looking into changing the waste band as well. excellent customer service. they fit great with lots of length and extremely comfortable. i plan on ordering these in a different color. must have! very comfy! i\\'m wearing it as my &#34;fashionably&#34; pj, but i gotta warned you that pant is probably bit short for your legs (just 2 inches above ankle) since i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; for size medium. i\\'ll totally buy it one more for in case. i am 5 ft 9 and 140 lbs usually i wear a medium. i got a medium they are snug but fit right especially for tall girls. if a regular mwdium ia tight on you these wont work you need to go large or ex large they are made pretty cheap and i don\\'t know how well the will gold up i like these pants okay, but the elastic waistband is very tight.  it cuts into my skin so you see a small roll over it. i have a little tiny waist for my size 8 frame. i\\'m 5\\'6&#34;-135 pounds and the length was pretty good.  i wore them out one night to a jazz club with heels.  they are pretty cheaply made, and of course the material is not cotton.  i think it\\'s polyester.....that\\'s what it feels like. it\\'s a smooth fabric with a medium/light weight.  even though i\\'m not currently belly dancing, i think they would work great for that purpose.  the legs are very flowing.  i suppose the tight waistband would help keep them up if you\\'re shimmying.  i\\'m sure i\\'ll wear them out again, i just have to be careful what top i wear, so i don\\'t see the ridge at the top of the elastic.  i do like the color.  i get tired of wearing black, and it\\'s a pretty color of purple. i also liked the detail of the  waist--cute for belly dancing, when we don\\'t care about our muffin top, because we\\'re showing off our bellies. i\\'m a sunshine calif transplant now living in beautiful new york. this is my second winter and yes, this one has been pretty brutal (sorry mother nature) but the streets in manhattan are a slushy mess! however, these snow pants are a-mazing!!! i don\\'t leave home without them. i can wear my beautiful clothes underneath- rain,  sleet, or snow, stay completely dry, and transform into fabulous-ness when i remove them at work. beautiful ladies, not only do they fit super cute, they\\'re a great investment! thanks arctix! these are perfect. they look just like jeans and are very soft. they have the butt pockets. but not the front pockets. i\\'m between a 9 and 11. and so i bought an 11 and they\\'re great. they\\'re not baggy or too tight. i wish i could find them in more colors cause i\\'ve found the perfect pair of pants now. comfortable and stylish for the deadpool fan wo just wants to hang out around the house ;) when i first tried these pants on, i thought &#34;oh no!, too big&#34;. but then a great revelation came. when i tried my tennis shoes on with them, they were a perfect fit. these pants are thing enough to fit into tennis shoes and drape enough to work outside the shoes without hanging on the ground. love them!  thank you they are pretty nice, soft and absorbent. i actually was worried these wouldn\\'t fit right. but i gotta say for the $$ there 5*. i bought 3 pairs. seems well made. like the pockets and pass thru. leg opening seem wide enough. havent tested them in bad weather yet. excellent product ! i\\'ve had these pants for a few months now and really like them...especially for $18.  i am 5\\'4&#34; and around 185 pounds right now and the mediums fit me great.  i also got a pair of large and those fit ok when i first put them on, but within a few minutes they loosened up and wanted to fall down.  so if you want your yoga pants to be tight fitting (tight, but not so tight they cut off circulation or anything; they are just fitted and not loose), you may want to get a size below what you would normally wear.  and i love the thick waisteband!<br /><br />i wear these pretty regularly and they are starting to lose a little bit of their elasticity, so another reason to go with a size smaller if you want them to last a while.  i normally buy victoria\\'s secret yoga pants and got tired of spending so much money on them and these are great for the price.  however, they may not last as long as the vs ones. thanks for the size tip - i bought a size smaller than i usually wear and it fit just fine. the material is good; nice and crisp when ironed. i ordered four of the suits offered by darya trading.  i was a bit sceptical when i placed the order, but i figured \\'what can you lose - it\\'s amazon\\'.  to my amazement, the quality and cut of these suits rival anything i have in my closet, including 2 \\'monsieur givenchy\\' suits that cost over $850.    in fact, for all-season wear here in texas, i prefer the fabric of these darya suits!  it is a wool/silk blend that has to be felt to be believed.  in addition, the lining, details, and stitching indicate a top-quality product.  all the labels are in italian, and the fabric manufacturer has a tag in there as well (which checks out).  the flat-front pants are a great touch as well - i\\'m a big guy and double-pleats make me look like the hindenburg blimp.  the pants are nice enough to wear by themselves, actually.  some would argue that the pants are not lined to the knee (as is usually done in upscale tailoring), but i prefer un-lined because of summer weight.  besides, with a fabric as nice as this, the pants drape perfectly without the lining anyway.  i wear a 50 long, and \\'cheap\\' suits are usually cut skimpy.  these are not, however, and run very true to size, at least in the large end of the range.  for me, i like the 2-button models.  i ordered 4 suits, but the two i received that have fabric labeled \\'150s\\' seem the nicer.  i\\'m not a shill.  the suits are this nice!  i have no idea how they can do it, but you\\'re an idiot if you delay to argue :-) mama likes. mama wants more. these are great!  i don\\'t want to take them off! great quality i do like these pants.  they fit comfortably and the material is nice.  however, i do not feel that these are extra long. there were a couple of long threads that i had to trim.<br />the fit was ok. i\\'m 5&#34;9 and typically get a 10/12.<br />my only complaint would be the lack of a tag. it\\'s hard to tell front to back. i have to line up and see where the crotch seams hits to make sure i\\'m putting the shorter front rise on correctly, otherwise i put them on and have to switch them around.<br />also they had an odor so i had to wash them, but whatever you should always wash stuff before wearing i bought these pants for my baby girl and i can say that they are very nice with good quality. i did not expect such kind quality, and i became surprised when i saw them. i really want to suggest these pants to others families, not expensive with good quality. i bought these before a ski trip in the mountains. i am not the best skier so i fall a lot...these pants kept me dry and warm in the frigid air...more than i actually expected for a cheap pair of snow pants. i would put them up against any snow pants out there...possibly the best purchase i have ever made on amazon! this is very comfortable and the material very soft and durable. even after a couple of washes the colors are as good as new. i got them for work and they are great! i\\'m about 5\\'5&#34; and 125ish pounds. in ordered the 3 and they fit perfectly around then waist, legs and butt. my only bad comment is that their slightly long but not a biggie :) love these pants!  super-comfy, wear them all the time & get many compliments! i bought the \\\\\\\\\"color multi 516\\\\\\\\\", which has a well define pattern and requires symmetry.  when i got the pants, they were completely asymmetric.  luckily, the seller, z-la, took the time to find one that was symmetric (as in the picture) and exchange it for me.  the second was symmetric but the bright colors were in the back (not in the front as in the picture) and the dark part on the front.  however, this is better than totally asymmetric.  if not having a symmetric pattern as shown in the picture bother you, you may want to check with the seller and make sure they send you what you really want. this specific seller was so nice that made the experience good and reduced frustration.<br />besides the asymmetry issue, the pants are nice.  they are long, which is great for tall people, and they fit well. just wanted some warm snow pants to play in the snow with the kids, shovel the driveway etc.  these kept me warm and dry and were comfortable and fit well.  i love the pockets having velcro, my old snow pants had no pockets. these are so comfortable that i can see why other reviewers wanted to wear these for more than just yoga. they are comfortable and perfect for yoga. perfect little stretchy pants for my grandson.  very comfortable for him and easy to pull on for me. i couldn\\'t find any in the local stores so i was very happy to find them on amazon. kalon clothing medium weight yoga pants (small, charcoal) were purchased based on others reviews. i believe they are a good buy and our daughter loves them. so, so comfortable and beautifully stylish and simple! flattering, too! second pair of pants i purchased from ellazhu. i look forward to more from this merchant. i\\'m 5\\' 8 1/2&#34; these scrubs by dickies, are durable, and easy to care for. they are also one of the few products which have an inseam of 28 and a half in petite, which is my size. they are good quality, the fabric is tough, but not aggravating to the skin. i rarely have to iron them as they seldom wrinkle if folded right out of the dryer, something i can\\'t say for most scrubs. the only down side is a lack of pockets, as there is only one, but my shirts have pockets so that isn\\'t a big deal for me. over all a good pair of work scrubs which i will happily purchase again the next time i need new work pants. t love it. somewhat smaller.  beautiful design and comfortable. would re order.  came faster than expected with free shipping.  bought a red one too. love them and wear them alot! fits perfectly.<br /><br />need more words....good color! very fits! so compliment! much buy now! wow! love these pants. i am 5\\'4, 130lbs, they fit me perfect, maybe a little long. nice breathable material, flowy fabric, very comfortable. love em! very pretty pants but....they are extremely small. i ordered m/l (i\\'m between a 10/12).<br />i couldn\\'t get the waist past my thighs.<br />but, like i said they are beautiful. sadly i have to send them back. the pants are comfortable and durable. the side cinches don\\'t really stay, but that is to be expected. the zipper also sticks momentarily, but all in all i really like the product. i would buy them again this item arrived quickly with a nice hand written note. they were nice quality but too small for my 7 week old boy. this the best training pant, holds a moderate amount of pee. i make my 3 year old wear them in morning and a pull up in the night. he is almost trained, must have for potty training. these are just as pictured and very comfortable i like the material of the sweater, the shipping was fast and efficient, item as described. i use it for my belly dancing classes and exercise. so cute, and they have held up to washing for several months now. i ordered these for my husband who had an old pair from before.  i got tired of seeing him wear them with holes and all!  however, he absolutely loves them so i surprised him with a new pair.  they were not easy to find but here they were!  they are incredibly comfortable and absolutely last forever.  they are true to size and are great for summer and for the winter! i\\'m about 5\\'7\\\\\\\\\" and these pants are just a tad long, which is what i was looking for. the wide waistband rarely folds up. i wear these to work 5 days a week and after about a month there is no sign of the annoying ware between the thighs. i wish these came in more colors! i rock climb in these pants was sorta freaked about the stirrups.  yet the four way stretch material and stirrups work great good moisture control warm but not uncomfortable do to the breath ability.  these pants are form fitting tight follow the size guide, these are tight fitting pants! i wore these when i was riding my bike in the winter time.flying down the road at 65mph i was warm andtoasty.very good quality build. im 5\\'3&#34; , 110-114lbs. ordered a small and fit perfectly. they\\'re very comfortable.. made well. and overall, a great pair of joggers. unfortunately i got a burn hole some how on them already :( so i will be ordering another pair! great transaction. good quality and very cute jeans sizing is a bit off. they run a little on the large side. perfect!! i recommend this to any and everybody ! you will love them oh, yes you can! because with a pair of these legendary zubaz pants its hammer time all the time!<br /><br />women will want to touch you and other men will want to be you!<br /><br />not only did m c hammer know a good pair of pants when he saw it, so did aladdin! hot babes fought to rub his lamp for his fabled \\\\\\\\\"three wishes\\\\\\\\\"! yes they did!<br /><br />and these were the pants that drove amy fisher crazy! remember the sartorial splendor of joey buttafuoco? it wasn\\'t the mullet, it was his zubaz pants! god was he hot! even for an auto mechanic in baldwin, long island, the zubaz made the man.<br /><br />what you ask is a zubaz? don\\'t really know for sure, but after some period of time when they were missing, they have now returned. the great guys at best form fitness gear were able to find them somewhere in the mists of time and re-release them. not only did they just release these amazing trend pants of the 1980\\'s, they made sure they came in the signature zebra pattern.<br /><br />some say that zubaz is how you pronounce zebra in baldwin, long island, some say that zubaz is the preferred east coast dyslectic spelling of zebra and some say that zubaz is the word for middle-aged-male-shlub-zebra-coach-potato in swahilli. others say nothing at all.<br /><br />do not be fooled by imitations! [[asin:b000lkln28 o500 otomix baggy workout gym pants - american flag]]  for instance, these flag pants claim to be the real baggy workout pants, but lets face it, they are easily recognized as socialist impostors. there is only one zubaz! i got these for my girlfriend and they fit the bill well. she reports them to be the most comfortable yoga pants she had, so much so that i ordered her a second pair in kelly green and some capris, which are a different material. it\\'s also worth noting that the length is correct and that these pants are not transparent. they fit well, hugging where they should and falling loose at the feet while staying put during workouts, including running.<br /><br />a couple things to note:<br />these are junior sizing so be sure to order a size up from your regular size and these are yoga pants, not leggings, though cotton cantina also makes those. perfect i have two of these, a 4t in lotus that my daughter adores, and i just received the twilight as a gift in 0-3 for my baby on the way. as usual the fabric is amazingly soft and comfortable on the skin. i wish all clothing were made of this bamboo viscose - it hangs nicely on the body and feels great. the colors are very nice. my only wish would be for kp to not produce in china. great quality and workmanship.  the material is soft and nice!  i would definitely recommended this! great jeans fro my teen. this are realalistic looking. i really like them. a few of my friends purchased them too. cool as heck. awesome these are the best pajamas. i love putting them on my one year old; they\\'re so soft. the fact that they stretch means that he can wear them longer than any other clothes which definitely makes them worth the price. workout pants? are you kidding me? what kind of twatwaffle wears pants when they work out!? probably some skinny ladyboy thats who...     these pants have been around for a couple decades because guys like me wear them. i am a mac and these are my mac pants. chicks dig these pants and all they want to do is drop trou (my mac trou) when they see me strut out of gnc. they go great in any mac opportunity. i wore these asteroids mac pants last week at my neighbor vinny\\'s wedding at the elks lodge with my best tuxedo-t-shirt and i killed it. the hottest girls form the shady acres trailor park, my cousin nadine and a pitbull were all over me all night.     these are mac pants and they are for macs only. love how soft kickee pants pjs are - and this design is so cute! we bought a 3t for our large 16 month old. she wears 2t in most other clothes. i\\'ve tried numerous brands and all of them were not a long enough rise (mostly way too low)  these wranglers are exactly what i wanted. a longer rise but not too long, good quality and just what i was looking for. i wasn\\'t sure what size to get since i don\\'t wear junior sizes so i went with an 11 since i\\'m a 10 women\\'s.  i was able to get it on and zipped but it was definitely too small for me but fits my daughter.  i did have 5 children, i\\'m in my 40s so i\\'m not exactly shocked that i couldn\\'t fit in this size.  i\\'m going to try the size 13 because the pants are really, really nice and stretchy.  these are really great jeans so i\\'m hoping that they fit.  :)  i\\'ll let you know! love these and they fit great..feel so good..nice dressy leggings.. if u haven\\'t ever bought these they are worth every penny!!! they get softer the more you wash them and they are simply the most comfortable thing to put on your newborn so comfy! i love so much. its somewhat large on me but considering i\\'m a small person it fits like the rest of my pajama pants aha. it came on time and i was so happy with this product!<br /><br />i would totally buy more from this company!<br /><br />one con though.<br /><br />its pretty expensive for a pair of pajama pants :( but it was worth the money when i got it. good quality, fair price, long lasting.  i\\'m a yoga teacher, so i\\'ve tried many different yoga pant brands.  these are my favorite. ordered these for a concert. my daughter loved them. for the price great product. look like leather pants.. motley crue here i come very comfy and roomy! i absolutely love these capris! very comfortable for lounging and hitting the gym! i would recommend these to anyone! plus the contrasting blue on the waist band is a great color! great yoga pant - just as described by others:  comfy, thinner fabric which i like, one of the few yoga pants that does not drag on the floor for my 5\\'4 frame- love the pink fold over top too. stretchy and nice color. cheap quality but i don\\'t need them often so this is fine. i love these pants! they fit very well and are cute and comfortable. awesome i lost my &#34;marshmallows&#34; from bct so i decided to purchase these ones to replace them. they\\'re a decent replacement and look exactly like my previous ones. the only issue is that the mediums are too large for me - i\\'d actually need these ones in an extra small when, typically, i\\'m an average-sized person. if you are planning on purchasing these, i\\'d recommend selecting one size smaller than what you typically wear in sweats. other than the size, i love these things. my friend recommended these pants to me and i couldn\\'t have been happier.  these are the ultimate gym pants.  they are stretchy, flattering, comfortable and have great movement.  these pants are great for running, yoga or just hanging out. item was shipped in timely manner and size was right on! would do business with vendor again! great quality and good material. want to wear all the time these are very good quality exercise pants, with nice pockets. my favorite pants. not many babies wear this yoga pants style around here. that gives me something.<br />soft material, waist band fits snugly and mother of the baby loves it! got to have another. i am a size 10-12  and the medium fits great! my only problem is that i have a long torso so the rise is a little short in the back... i just hide it with a hip wrap. these are wonderful pants and for a good price too. my baby is wearing the 6-9 size and she is about 16 lbs and 26 inches at six months. the length is very good. i think she\\'ll be in these at least another month or so. the material isn\\'t cheap or light and they don\\'t stretch out easily. the color of these match the colors in most baby clothing out there presently - which is very nice! i\\'ve bought a bunch of things from baby because through amazon and some are really poor quality and others, like these, are wonderful, so don\\'t judge them on their prices, some of their things are really nice. these pants are at least as good as the more expensive ones. i recommmend them. i loved the quality of these cargo pants immediately!  they were initially a little big, so i washed and dried them -- bingo!  they shrunk to fit perfectly.  i might be ordering another pair soon... :) review of the pants in black:  i would have given these pants a five star rating, but the side seam split after a wash or two.  that said, the split hasn\\'t gotten any larger despite my continued wear.  as far as size goes, i am about 5\\'8&#34; and too many pounds, and was probably a candidate for the extra large size.  since the reviews said the pants can stretch out after a while, i went with the large size and i am very happy with it.  they are the perfect length, and the only time they feel tight is around my waist when i am a bit bloated.  i wouldn\\'t wear them off my property as they are a bit too form fitting for polite society, but i bought them to be lounge pants and they are great for the house and taking my dog out.  i would definitely buy them again. these pants are of the utmost quality! however, i normally wear an x-large and in these i had to order 2x. these are just what i needed for my costume.  they are very comfortable.  i just with there was a good way to deal with the extra string after tightening the ankle/calf area. i loved it! it fits so perfect. these pants are great for working the best work pants i have found to this day.  light with some flex to them and 8 pockets to store material in the only way i see these pants improving is putting zippers on the 4 side pockets instead of buttons and makeing the back pockets a little bigger. love these pants! comfortable and love the velcro on the pockets!! just ordered the black pair! the price was low compared to the high quality of the pants. this belt will make a woman blush so badly you will laugh. it is a great belt and had nothing but great reviews from other people. good product, but watch sizing. i really wish i could buy these in a 12 month size. i would probably have bought two sets, but alas, our admittedly larger 5 month old is in the last days of wearing the large, i.e., 6-9 month size. i received my order a day or two before expected..i love how thick they are..very comfy, especially for these cold months. i read a lot of the reviews& decided to go up a size as many of other buyers had done. :) i love when people mention their height&weight & how the product fits..it def helps to have that info..so ty to those of you who did so.saved me time& $!!!  i am 5\\'4, 137lbs & ordered an xl...these fit me snug but very cute. i am 127 pre-prenacy so i thought after i loose 5-10 lbs these will still fit well. the legging hit right below my ankle, perfect coverage..would be adorable with tall boots, cute ballets or great pair of heels.  the tights are very stretchy&comfortaby. b/c of the great thick material, there is a lot of control at the top through the stomach and hip area...i ordered the black pair.  make sure you have a lint roller handy bc they attract a lot of lint..  i like these for date night w/hubby and for around the house. i would probably wear a long cardigan over this to cuurch for modesty but it is a great purchase&i may get another color. if you are looking for an adorable, polished look..this is it. i had on jeans w/a sweater before these arrived..i left this on after trying them!!!:) i was looking for pants i could wear while wearing a cast and this one fits the bill!<br />does not wrinkle easily.<br />perfect buy! its a very good product fits as expected these are very comfortable. i am short &#34;5\\'4&#34; and so i always have to take the inseam up about 3 to 4 inches so they don\\'t drag on the ground. its worth it good quality bought these for a new job, the size was just right (man size l). the quality of the fabric is a little stiffer and thinner than more expensive brands, but they work just fine, are holding up well, and considering i can buy 2 entire sets of uniforms for the price of one top of most other brands, i am quite pleased. if you\\'re looking for an inexpensive set that looks very nice and professional without breaking the bank, i highly recommend these.<br /><br />side note: i found them cheaper directly on the manufacturer\\'s site, so don\\'t be afraid of shopping around. everything about the leggins is perfect! they came a week earlier than promised! they are super fashionable for my british loving granddaughter. and they kept her warm on her stay in virgina for christmas. very good i wasn\\'t sure about ordering pants online because i am tall and thin. these pants though fit great in all the right places. they were just as comfortable as i had hoped. great fit. great feel. love them!!! love these pants. great fit . i weigh 217 and 5\\'6&quot; bought xl. will buy other colors too. light weight. may not be good for really cold weather without long johns.<br />very happy purchaser. jaye good fits perfect ! wonderful. very thin material though i\\'m really happy with these leggings. in fact, i\\'m ordering another pair in a different color. they are made of nice thick material that seems high quality. the thick waist band is super comfortable and really flattering.  i ordered a size m and i\\'d say they are a little larger than other size m i have owned, which was actually perfect for me. i love my new 100 emoji joggers fits perfect excellent design very comfortable anyone love the kickee he loves his big boy pants & can even pull them up & down by himself. totally comfy sleep and lounging pants.  great for sleeping or embarrassing the kids.<br /><br />the boys like them, too.  ;-)<br /><br />nice quality fabric, not thin, cheepo stuff but not heavy fleece.  just right. absolutely love them! i definitely recommend! what precious yoga pants...designed so cute and ultra soft!  they were the perfect gift for a yoga loving new mother! i am 10 + weeks pregnant w/ twins - second pregnancy. my regular pants are too tight to wear, and my maternity clothes too big.  so, i went shopping for some great pants to start out my pregnancy, and i wanted something i could wear post pardom too.  i found them!  these pants are very comfortable.  they do fit a little snug in the butt &amp; legs, so if you don\\'t like that look, you may want to go up a size.  i chose the same size as my pre-pregnancy pants, and they are snug in the butt &amp; legs, but very comfy and roomy in the belly area.  i like the way they look with a longer button down shirt.  i don\\'t look like i am in maternity clothes, and i am very comfortable at work! i got this item in the mail pretty quick, i must admit it only took 4 days to receive it, and it was packaged well. although it was missing an o ring, its still in great quality. very nice fabric. but i ordered a size too large i think, i fit 28, and 30 waist generally (usually 30) so i ordered a small in case i grow, and it is a bit big.  i love the zip off feature and all the chains. i have only two complaints;  it claims in the description the chains come off, which yes the chains do. nothing else does. i was expecting to take more than the chains off, but oh well ahaha.   also, i didd\\'nt receive this product. yes, i got white tripp pants size small, but they were different tripps. effing weird. i\\'ve read about this happening to others, and i beleive its a mistake on bewild\\'s part. but the pair i have has more chains and studs, and also skulls (which i dislike). the bottom only has a single strap, and no chains like in the picture which makes me sad... but, its a nice product, and their really nice! very comfortable and soft fabric was worried they wouldn\\'t fit right but they do.  use them for cycling on cold mornings and work great. i am 6\\' 2&#34; 205 lbs and bought xl and they fit perfect my buddy jake invited me out on a weekend fishing trip, so i ordered this jacket & pants suit in preparation. i didn\\'t want to make the \\\\\\\\\"rookie\\\\\\\\\" mistake of fishing without camouflage! i could tell by the look of surprise on jake\\'s face when i put this on that i made the right choice. i think he was shocked at how high-tech, sharp-looking, and camouflage this outfit really was. he was also probably jealous because all he had on was a red jacket and blue jeans.    i was confident that this \\\\\\\\\"ultra light gorillie jacket\\\\\\\\\" would give me the \\\\\\\\\"edge\\\\\\\\\" on my first time fishing. i went all day without a bite though. but i know it wasn\\'t the fault of my special hunting outfit! jake said it was because i used doritos on my lure.     anyway, even though i experienced a \\\\\\\\\"roadblock\\\\\\\\\" on my first try with this camo jacket-suit, i have used it many times since. i take it to go camping, or i just use it in the backyard when i need to see what the neighbors are doing over the fence. one time i used it to \\\\\\\\\"surprise\\\\\\\\\" my daughter and her friends at her 3rd birthday party. boy, did they run for the hills when i jumped out from the hedges!     i would recommend this gear to anybody who needs to \\\\\\\\\"cover up\\\\\\\\\" from time to time. although you might want to check with your local police department to see where it\\'s ok to use. you might find out that its not appropriate to use this gear to sneak into dormitories. i\\'m a woman who wears a size 6 and found the size small in this pant to be too large! i had to take them in with my sewing machine and now they fit. i rated them as a 4, because the fabric is extremely soft, they are well made and the black color is very dark. these are comfy and fit great. fabric is thin and breaths but not at all see-through totally cute pants, were a total hit, but they are a little tight. think the sizes run for tiny asian chicks idk. very nice pants.  the fit was good and the quality of the fabric was excellent.  and the pockets come in very handy while my husband was recovering in a wheelchair. thank you. my son is 3 yrs old, almost 3.5 yrs old and we\\'ve had a hard time potty training and these training pants have been a good medium between pull ups and regular underwear. these are so comfortable, and really keep the tummy in nicely without stretching out or shifting around so that i don\\'t constantly have to adjust my pants while working out! i have found most pants do not possess the sheer testicular capacity needed to house a woman-pleaser of my caliber.  so i was a little skeptical upon ordering these zubaz pants.  but after wearing these pants i can only say they are, without a doubt, the pants of the gods!  how else could one explain the quality and style detailed in these 60/40 poly-cotton elastic purple zebra print man-pants?  nay, not man-pants, but from henceforth, mants!  from the first moment these mants caressed my groin area, my gonads immediately felt cradled and secure, yet free enough to sway hither and fro upon the slightest movement.  the reactions i received upon sporting these diety inspired mants were amazing to say the least.  upon approaching women, i found they could not take their eyes off of my sugar bulge.  their eyes were transfixed as if staring into the face of god!  i also noticed their pants or skirts would drop almost immediately upon my arrival and their panties would explode off of their bodies in a blast of sexual anticipation.  it was incredible!  and the male reactions were equally amazing!  i noticed even the biggest, toughest guys would avert their eyes and cower in fear upon my approach.  i mean, honestly, who wants to get a roundhouse kick to the face by a guy sporting these bad boys?  answer: nobody!  bottom line is, i highly recommend these mants!  buy them in every color for every occasion!  it changed my life and it can change yours too! excelente the pants are great quality but if your short and fat like me (i got a medium/short) they\\'re going to be a bit baggy. my daughter is a huge harry potter fan and got a kick out of the sweats. she loved them! very happy it was a gift - she loves them but they did come with a minor small hole in the crotch area - nothing major she will sew them up - it happens. i wanted these soooo bad and they were out .. but they restocked and i jumped at it!  so glad i did!!!  you just can\\'t go wrong with these.  i get a surprising number of unexpected compliments when i wear these.  white top, black top... plus any color you like... its all good.  they look and feel so much more expensive than they actually are.  you absolutely cannot go wrong with these if you get them.  even though they are a very distinct pattern, im totally considering getting them in the other colors as well just because... roll tide!! fits prefect around the waist but a little to long! all and all i like the sweat pants. support nypd! theyre perfect, exactly what i expected and fast shipping! other than running a little on the small side it is wonderful these pants were as cheap as any other pants i\\'ve ever bought and only cost $8.  they are sized correctly and very well made.  perfect for hanging around.  they are not jeans or dress pants, they are exactly as advertised.  i will be buying from this co. again. the package arrived safely and was before estimated delivery date. the pants were very nicely folded in the envelope and when i took them out, they immediately were wrinkle free. they fit very nicely and do not cling. they are soft and comfortable; i\\'m in love! ;) surprised no fly opening. fits perfectly and its warm too the only part i didn\\'t like, was the bright white splotches. most other blue/gray camo has no bright white. we have others, that are just blue/gray/black. that is a minimal issue, and the pants are nice. my son likes them, and that\\'s what matters most. my shorts fit just right except i wish they were a smidgen longer, but, they are comfortable, and they got here in two days. good for the price for sure! oh, and i got blue and black. a little short on the back side, but the pattern was just what i wanted, only thing is the color is a little off from the picture. m. mac products are the greatest.  excellent fabric and design. i\\'m 5\\'4. bust is 34b. waist is 27. hips is 40. so i have a pear shaped body. small up top and big bottom. i ordered a large, and they fit fantastic!!! most of the jeans i get have a gap in the back but these jeans hugged my bottom so good<br />i will be buying more colors i really like the dress. its perfect. im usuallyget the small size but i got this for medium and its really perfect! i got lots of compliments with this dress. perfect for spring! made out of cotton and made in india, these are supper fun to wear. my aunt even wanted some! they even have pockets! i stand 5\\'11&#34; and they fit so well. i\\'m on the heavy set side and noticed the elastic for the waist is a bit small, but it keeps it from falling off. people at work asked me if these were a skirt or pants!! that\\'s what i love you can\\'t figure it out!! trendy is me!!! they fit really comfortable i\\'m 5&#34;5 170 and they flowed on me great! even with my big ole rump roast *wink**  if you like trendy these r for you!!! you can dress the pants up or down and they look great!  multiple color options to choose from and i will definitely order additional pairs.  the size i ordered was a tad bit smaller in the waste than expected however it did not stop me from wearing them. i am always on the go and with these pants i go in style, but yet have everything i need without needing a bag. i have been able to carry water, my smart phone, gum, my wallet, a pen and other things without the need of a bag. i even keep a couple bagels and a carrot on me. my son loves them, but the grommets that the waist drawstring goes statted coming loose after the first wash. the stars are for the fact that my son likes them, not the quality of the product. good quality prompt delivery. as with other reviewers, there is a chemical smell but i have now washed on a cold wash around 4-5 times and added bicarbonate of soda and the smell is a lot less. i bought the medium and the fit is good. i am 5ft 4 and they are calf length. i weigh 150lb. the material is quite thick. they do really sweat you at the gym and i will keep wearing them in my mission to lose weight and tone up. they do make a swishing sound when walking etc but it is not too noticeable. i find them okay to wear, not something i would want to spend the whole day in but good to wear to the gym or a hike etc. i totally recomend this for parkour it is an amazing product feels amazing and has alot of comfort i will buy this again in the near future&#34; the fabric is a nice weight, not too heavy and not too thin. it is the usual quick dry fabric and breathes. i am 5\\' 4&#34; and the length is perfect!!! the fit, since it is semi-fitted is a little more relaxed than the tighter fitted exercise pants. i usually buy a large, but i wanted them to be easy to wear for travel as well, and ordered an xl. it fits, but is slightly loose in the waist, but i am happy with them for comfort. they are well made and i am now a fan of champion pants. i bought the just below knee pants for exercise in a large and like the more fitted for that. i am so enamoured with the cut of these pants!  they fit like they were made just for me.  thank you , thank you, thank you! love them these palazzo pants are very pretty and if you\\'re a person who likes to be different then these will get you noticed. the material is great and they are made very well. wash in cold water and i would let them air dry. if you\\'re in a hurry dry them on low and check often. so i wear a size 8 and the medium was a little small but the pants were gorgeous.  when i contacted the vendor they were awesome and held a larger size for me. usps lost my return but the vendor stayed in touch and when i got the large i was overjoyed. really pretty, not see- through like some you see and customer service was awesome you just don\\'t see that very often. great buy i\\'m very happy with it. fish don\\'t even see me coming. i would deffinatly get a size bigger, i did and it fits perfect. the advertised photo was accurate. i have only one complaint with the pants, and that is they are long.  very long.  other than that they fit beautifully and are extremely comfortable.  also, they\\'re the warmest pants i\\'ve ever owned.  i have been out in wind chills of negative nineteen degrees, and my legs are warm!  in that respect, they\\'re simply amazing.  the pockets are well made and strong as well.<br /><br />i\\'m very, very happy with these and would highly recommend them to anyone that has to be out in the cold. love love love. so does my baby. he was born 8lbs 11oz and 20.5in long.  i thought the 0-3 would fit better than the newborn size, but the 0-3 is actually a bit too big. the newborn size fits him perfectly with even a little room to grow. because the material is so stretchy, and meant to be snug, i can still use the 0-3 size if we are just lounging around the house, but it looks a little sloppy.  he looks adoreable in all kickee pants and it\\'s by far my favorite brand of baby clothing.<br /><br />the best thing about the kickee pants material is that it allows the baby to be most comfortable. our little guy was breech and as a result, still finds odd positions to be comfortable outside the womb as well. a number of clothes restrict his body from getting into a comfy position but kickee pants let him be in any position he chooses. plus, they\\'re super easy to put on and take off. the pants are very comfortable and wearable and i bought this item for my son and he like these type of pants. love these pants - i get a lot of compliments every time i wear them. i think they run a little small. i wear an 8 in lululemon yoga pants. ordered these in large.  i was glad i sized up. love it nice and cute, good value for money yeeeeowwwza!  fit is great. they are not heavy<br />i have a 35 inch waist 45\\\\\\\\\" hips<br />16 fit best. 14. tight.  kind of a rough textured fabric--- but not uncomfortable on my skin<br />i don\\'t use the zipper- i just pull them on.i wash them on gentle cycle in a mesh bag<br />then hang to dry--- fluff on low low heat.  i own 6 pairs.<br />i ask for deeper colors of purple, burgandy ,  deep olive, but black is the best! i am 5\\' 9&#34; tall. often times pants are not long enough for me. this was not the case with these pants! i purchased a medium.they were a great length and even gave a little room when i stretched. the fabric was soft and very comfortable but not so much that they fell off. with a long torso as well i wondered if i could utilize the fold over and it was great as well! great pants!! good great love them the material thick like dockers but very soft and comfortable. i wear 32w30l and ordered large and surprisingly it fits perfectly. bought this for my girlfriend who is a huge hp fan. i\\'ve got a few belts like this and she covets them so this was an obvious choice. sturdy quality, doesn\\'t feel or look cheap, bonus points for being super adjustable. i purchased the midnight teal & rich mahogany in large (12/14) and they fit very well. i\\'m very pleased with both purchases that i ordered it also in navy blue. i am 5\\'9, weight 190ish lbs and curvy build. they well hug your curves and give you a comfortable feel.<br /><br />edit: feb 13, 2013<br /><br />ok so it\\'s been about 3 months rocking these pants in several colors. i lowered the 5 star to a 4, but honestly i give them a 3.5. these pants require a belt (at least for me or it will slide off my hips giving me the baggy pooch at the front center). all in all the pants are cute but after wearing them, i would say they should have been made tighter around the hips (belt area) bc they will stretch. i have worn several different kinds of maternity pants - panel, low rider, overalls, no panel. by far, these are the most comfortable i have. they\\'ve made the transition with me from \\'barely showing\\' when my regular pants no longer fit, right up till the end when i was bigger than i ever imagined. the other pants with panels ended up being uncomfortable as i got bigger - the lower part where the panel ended cut into the bottom of my tummy. since these don\\'t have a panel, it\\'s not a problem - and they come out of the laundry looking great, time after time! they were kind of big on me, even following the sizing recommendations, but i still really like the pants. the materials used seem like they will last for a very long time. i think next time i will order a size smaller, but i am happy for now. also, great customer service, very attentive. love it!! good fit.. thin material so i would not get in a light color--but the weight is great for spring/autumn just right. much too large for a newborn. nice fabric, well made. looking forward to when this will fit my baby girl. would make a nice gift. i love these because they are soft and comfy for baby and didn\\'t shrink when washed. would i purchase again? oh definately! the first time i saw these pants i fell in love with them. and when i tried them on i fell even deeper. they fit so well and they look great on me. i\\'m so happy with my purchase plus they didn\\'t cost an arm and a leg. bought these for my girlfriend who was looking at them on amazon. they fit perfectly so they are true to size, and are made from good material, not a cheap kind that doesn\\'t look and feel nice. very cute leggings. got them for a halloween costume. they worked perfectly. they weren\\'t see through or anything and the graphic was nice too. good for a costume or just some fun and funky leggings to wear under a skirt or with boots. great buy! love these! they fit as expected and the colour is lovely and vivid. i\\'ve worn them for cleaning, lounging, rowing, and normal and hot yoga and they are super comfortable and easy to wash (throw in a colour catcher first time round. only reason it\\'s not 5 stars is that once they stretch a bit sheer. i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; & 145 lbs pre pregnancy. i generally wear 6 or 8 in pants. i\\'m now 25 wks pregnant & up 14 lbs. i ordered medium.  they were a tiny snug in my (athletic) thighs, but not horrible.  after walking 1/2 mile to work, they stretched just enough. now they\\'re perfect.  the material is nice and soft.  these will also be light enough for the hot texas summer weather. i\\'m purchasing another pair and praying they take me through my delivery date. very soft and very nice. they hold accidents nicely. not full out pee, it is not a diaper, but for accidents they are great. they run a bit large. loved these pants.  if you haven\\'t tried palazzo pants, you are missing out. they are stylish and easy to wear. very comfortable and best of all, they don\\'t wrinkle.  i travel anout 50% of the time for work and they pack and go with ease. my wife did sleep in sweets and i got these for her as a gift. she has worn them everynight since and says they are comfortable and she loves them adjusting the fold over waist can get a bit annoying, they\\'re a little long for a short person like me but overall i love them. very comfortable and flattering. these are not to be worn alone. they are for under short skirts, dresses or costumes. they are practically see through. these are the perfect gaucho pants. what makes them so good is first the material and then the fact that they have very wide legs which is quite flattering. the only problem i has was that they do run small ( i take a size s). since i like them so much i have reordered one size up in the same army green. it is the only reason i gave them four stars. just like the pic and adorable can\\'t wait to try it on my lil man! really great pants. kind of like jeggings but still cute. i got a medium and they fit my 5\\'3 body perfectly.<br />the only concern i have is that the color was a little darker than shown, but they still look nice. vibrant colors, nice lightweight material.  the only issue i had is the inside of the thigh area pilled up a little bit on the first wear.  it\\'s not noticeable when the pants are on, but it makes me weary of wearing them often.  however they are very comfortable and i would definitely consider getting more prints. best dancing pants ever! i just love them! i would like if they can offer more colors and models. i have been looking for a similar product for years and here it is.  i was extremely happy because i ripped a hole in my pants like this a year ago and haven\\'t been able to find another pair until now.  i will be ordering additional pairs! i ordered these for my daughter who loves unusual tights. the colours are great and i expect them to be a favourite fashion accessory during winter. they arrived within 2 weeks which was great. i bought these as 1 of my very first online purchases and i must say i\\'ve been shopping online since. when i bought these i ordered a size small thinking my other yoga pants i have from hollister were a small and they were a medium so i started to get nervous wile waiting for them i figured theyd be too short but when they got here i tried them on and they fit perfectly they have length to them which i was relieved about. i\\'m in love with these they stretch to ur form and are very comfortable. these are perfect for my mom.  she loves this shade of blue.  thank you! love!!! i am 5\\'9 but thin so i ordered a small and they are comfy and a great length. i ordered the capri style but they sent the long pants instead but i like how they fit so i don\\'t really care about the mix up.  for the price they are good quality and nice comfy material awesomeness i found these to be my most comfortable jeans. i bought 2 pairs because i love them. great color and they fit great!!! great pants very cute and pratical. i had abdominal surgery recently and  needed something unbinding and definitely without a zipper-- these are very comfortable and good looking, but don\\'t buy them if you are worried about things being skin tight! i thought they would have a wider leg: they don\\'t. i just received these jeans yesterday in black and wore them today - got many compliments! i came back to order them in the jade and white for spring. these fit just as expected and are very slimming. i am 5\\'3&#34; and 130lbs. so i normally wear a size 7 in juniors which is what i ordered. these fit perfect, not loose and not tight. can\\'t wait to receive the other pairs! great slip. i ordered to wear under skirts, but finding very comfortable under jeans as well. good quality, well made, since i am only wearing under other items, that it ran a little small was not a big deal, still very comfortable. these pants fit well and are great for workout and running.  lots of stretch and no sagging.  i have 3 pairs. these are a requested xmas gift but i know they will be great.  quality is good as represented..look comfy n warm. i love these pants, they fit prefect!!! for years linen pants were always too tight on my thighs but not these and they have a lining throughout the pants so that you don\\'t have to worry about them being see through. i wish they came in more than one color!!!! this was a birthday present/get well present and he just loved it. unfortunately he was hit in a car accident the day after his birthday hence a double gift. the fleece inside these leggings is so soft and comfortable.they\\'re truly amazingly warm and comfortable. i\\'m 5\\'7&#34; with a pretty big butt, and these do fit and make it all the way to my ankles as they\\'re meant to. this pair of tights was very inexpensive so i wasn\\'t sure what i\\'d get.  what i received was a very nice product, they are very comfortable and warm and true to size.  great value!! received them very fast and they fit perfectly fit great. bought for 17 month old i had seen the comments to order larger than you would normally order.  i ordered 2 sizes larger and they fit great!  it took a few weeks for them to ship, but they are worth the wait.  my son loves them!! very basic with only one inside pocket and a drawstring at the waist but the fit is perfect and the straps hold the pant in place. i use them for riding the bicycle and with padded shorts they\\'re just enough on winter days in va. if your tall you must get these pants.  i am 5 10 and all legs, the inseam<br />is just perfect  even a few inches over my shoes.  finally yoga pants that are<br />long !!!  the martial is thicker, no see through and heavier, great for holding<br />everything in at the right places but also soft.  the waist band is very comfortable<br />the rise is just right  i am all legs so i don\\'t want a long rise<br />i ordered a small 510. 132 and it\\'s perfect<br />price is great too. always can rely on tripp lol love them! i\\'m in love!!! can\\'t wait until it\\'s warm outside to wear them ! i heard of all sorts of ways to potty train- let the kid go naked, used just underpants, etc, but all of those ideas just made me think \\\\\\\\\"big mess!\\\\\\\\\" my parents used \\\\\\\\\"plastic pants\\\\\\\\\" to potty train my siblings and i, so i decided to look them up. while these aren\\'t completely mess-proof, they will contain a small accident, when used with underwear (i also got the gerber underwear that is thicker), and even kept larger accidents in (as long as my daughter didn\\'t sit down right after). there were two times that i can think of that we had pee just go down her leg, and then a couple of times we picked her up, and then felt wet on our arms. other than those few times, i\\'ve been able to peek inside the plastic pants, and see if her underwear was dry/if there was a little puddle of pee inside of the pants. it\\'s been so much easier than what i\\'ve seen others do, and allowed me to continue training her at other people\\'s house with very little worry that she would make a mess. i wouldn\\'t recommend putting them in the dryer, but they do just fine in the washing machine, and then we hang them up to dry. we love them! i\\'ve just about stopped wearing jeans.  cargos are so much more comfortable.  most of the ones i have are wrangler.  i only wish there were more color options. i love these pants! soft material. good craftsmanship. very roomy. the elastic wasteband is a bit tight for a \\\\\\\\\"one size/xxl\\\\\\\\\". i wear a 10 and waistband is perfect for me. first wash should be hand wash to see how much/if it bleeds. no complaints. nice pants to wear for lounging. i\\'ve ordered quite a bit from cotton cantina. i think it is decent quality for yoga pants and at this price. probably wouldn\\'t purchase from another brand on here.<br />i originally bought mediums but decided to continue buying in the large size. i wear mostly 10s in jeans. the mediums were a little see through on me but nothing crazy(i still just wear those at home though). so just make sure you buy a size that fits you well cause if they are too tight they might show a little. i only had that problem again though in the mediums around my ass...and occasionally thighs if i sat weird where my legs expanded to the size of france. very soft, nice organic cotton. best yoga pants i\\'ve had in awhile... snug fit and extra long- im 5\\'3. good material for reasonable price! bravo very comfy and the fit is great. i\\'m a size 8 and the mediums are perfect. looks great and fits great. who doesn\\'t love a good pair of zebra pants? my son is a huge dr. who fan.  he sprouted 3&#34; so had to get a larger size (his 2nd pair).  these are very comfy, durable and he loves them! these pants have a good arrangement of pockets and a zipper. the fabric is soft and comfortable, and we\\'ll see how it holds up to some regular wear and washings. ordered these for my 5\\' 2\\\\\\\\\" daughter.  she loves them, and will be ordering additional pairs for herself.  they are truly \\\\\\\\\"petite\\\\\\\\\" - fall perfectly on her sneakers, and don\\'t drag on the ground.  beautifully made fits perfectly... thinking about getting two more! amazon is a gold mine for unisex baby clothing. because i will not be finding out what i will be having, it is great to find cute clothing that doesn\\'t scream \\\\\\\\\"i\\'m generic.\\\\\\\\\" the viscose bamboo material is soft and stretchy. perfect for squirmy limbs. (not to mention the brand name is adorable!!) i love the patterns they offer. i bought this outfit in \\\\\\\\\"natural acorn.\\\\\\\\\" perfect for an eco-friendly mama. cute. great fit~shipped fast! great product! all is ok these pants are an unbelievable value.  the quality is excellent, and i am used to loro piana and manrico, so i know my cashmere.  they run true to size, but the rise is a little shorter than i\\'d like. excellent product i\\'m 5\\'7&#34;. i currently weigh 140lbs., but when i put these on my wish list, i weighed 120lbs. my husband got these off my list for me for christmas, and at first i was concerned they would not fit, as i didn\\'t think to change the size. my current pants are tight, and a couple won\\'t zip up. i wear anything from a 0-2 for shops like loft, or a 3 old navy, or a 5/6 target. fortunately, they fit, albeit slightly snug around the hip, and a bit more stretched than is ideal. when i get back down, they should be perfect.<br /><br />the fabric is cottony, but not in a thick, fuzzy way--it feels very silky and smooth. as my inseam is longer, i like that they\\'re long enough. the foldover top is nice, but note that there is a bright red emblem about the size of a penny that is visible in the back when it is folded over. as most women in america now dress almost exclusively in yoga and other workout wear on a daily basis, these are a nice break from the typical black pant/legging, but without getting neon or too fitness-style-y. there\\'re more of a casual clothing look, good with some platform sneakers and a t-shirt.<br /><br />the gray is very \\'warm\\' and almost looks brown or tan, so if you\\'re looking for a true gray, this isn\\'t it. also, if you tend to get hot in yoga class, you\\'ll probably want a cooler top, as these feel as though they\\'d be on the warmer side. for me, they\\'ll work well for winter, spring, and fall, but i doubt i\\'d use them for summer unless the room was heavily air-conditioned. with the flare leg, there\\'s a lot more fabric at the ankle, so i wouldn\\'t use these for anything other than yoga, walking, or maybe dance--certainly not jogging or cycling.<br /><br />seams/construction seems good--no initial problems. i\\'m very happy with them. i love these pants! i am 5\\'10 they are the perfect length which is so hard to find for my height bc pants are usually too short on me. they are made out of a super soft t-shirt material. i also got them in the mail way sooner than expected. so happy i\\'m buying another pair ‚ò∫ not too bad i really like the fit. and, i like the color. it was a nice vivid purple. i haven\\'t washed them yet, so we\\'ll see if they fade easily. great gift! wow! how did i get along without these!?<br />cool and comfortable.<br />quality linen<br />cutest fit ever! (i love that the waistline is lower and doesnt rise way up above my belly button).<br />i bought 2 pair, and have plans to buy 3 more.<br />shipping a bit slow but totally worth the wait. light, comfortable, relatively quick-drying. all i really needed or wanted. as good as could be expected from a pair of chef pants at this price. could have more utility pockets (cargo, cellphone, pen/knife/thermometer) but other more expensive pants with such features tend to botch the placement and size of such anyway. will buy this product again. too small but i\\'m going to keep them. so far, so good! these are so comfy, perfect for sleeping, relaxing or working out. i wear them all the time. i have no complaints, but i do wish they made these in petite sizes as i am 5\\'3&#34; and they are a little too long. i don\\'t mind though, i just use the extra material to cover up my cold feet when i\\'m chillin\\' at home. :) good product. this dress is perfect! i can not get over how soft the material is. i worry about rough materials against my daughters skin but not with this dress. it is perfect for humid southern summers. so lightweight and comfy. i got the bloomers to go with it. she actually came home from the hospital in the natural one, and i got twilight and orchid in a bigger size for later. the price is a little steep since they outgrow clothes so fast, but i have three sisters that will be having babies so it will get passed down to them for sure. i would recommend this to anybody! love color and true to size these are the perfect work pants! professional and comfortable at the same time, they are forgiving in size and easy to care for. i ordered 2 of each color to make getting ready for work easy! i love the material, it\\'s super stretchy but i was worried that they wouldn\\'t fit when i bought them, i was surprised. i am 5\\'4 220lbs and they fit perfectly. if you\\'re a bit bigger don\\'t worry! they\\'ll still fit! ain\\'t no shame ~ i love this jumpsuit. it\\'s very comfortable and well fitting. will order again in another color. everyone i know thinks they\\'re rad, and they look just like the picture. :&#62; these pants are my very favorite! i got a large because i\\'m relatively tall (5\\'11&#34;) but also thin. they can be tightened so it\\'s not a problem. they\\'re great because even though they\\'re technically men\\'s pants they fit me excellently. plus they have pockets and show my love for loki!! all around excellent pants. they aren\\'t too thick, but they still keep me warm without being stifling. pants length just right and top fit perfectly. both are lovely. i am happy with this purchase. thanks. love them! these pants are great - easy to get on and off, even for a newly potty-trained kid, and are very warm and cozy. great quality - pretty thick material - will order more. when these pants arrived i was eager to put them on, they fit very well but are longer then my legs by some inches but i am quiet short! ido recommend that when shopping, do go up in one size i ordered these to wear under a dress for halloween.  they were comfortable and didn\\'t leave marks from being too tight. loved them. and arrived in record breaking time. this material is very soft and comfortable to sleep in!! i really like the print too.  it\\'s somewhat loose and stretchy material.  i really like it! i love it ordered a pair of these to play basketball in and the results were instant. all i needed to do was add some retro nike high tops and i was doing stuff on the court i\\'ve never down before. picture me, a 6\\'1&#34; white dude with no athletic skills whatsoever. i put these babies on and i\\'m michael jordan\\'s white brother, larry jordan. i was throwing down windmill dunks and alley-ooping to myself off the backboard. i was making it rain from mid-range and behind the arc like rich lonely dudes do with strippers at the strip club. i barely felt tired while wearing these pants, i couldn\\'t even sit still. my mentality completely changed from, &#34;i love basketball&#34; to &#34;damn, ball is life&#34;. did i mention the women? they were on me like flies to one of them blue shock lights you see hanging on some crappy trailer in the south. if you looking to jump start your game, than go no further. order a few pairs though, cause your homeboys gonna wanna steal them so they can be like you. hope this helped, i\\'m out though, got a sweet little thing ready to play with my balls. super cute and fell great :) they are awesome for dancing and great for parkour also these jeans are hot! they fit me like a glove and i get compliments every time i wear them. i will definitely buy these in other colors. everywhere i go people stop me and ask where i got my pants. i have 5 different pairs and they\\'re great. they run a little large, so if you\\'re a large, you can drop a size to a medium and enjoy the &#34;imagined&#34; weight loss. :d so comfy and cute! my 8 month old is very tall so the pj\\'s with footies don\\'t fit her. these are great cause she wears these at night with socks. soo soft!!! cute but i should have ordered one size up. the material is thin enough i would have liked them to be a little looser. you will need these type of thermals daily easy to change diapers in and no snaps to work at nightime - simple adorable get 2 or 3 pairs because otherwise you will want them washed everyday they are so comfortable for her!!! nice pants if you have a big butt definitely buy it . ! your man will love. it got these for my husband for christmas. they are the &#34;proper&#34; size for him, but they fit a bit snugger than he would like, and is used to for this kind of pant. they are a great print, and he does wear them, but not as often due to the fit. fit as expected and look great. will be buying another pair. great product. really pretty color! (i got the green.) i am 5\\'7\\'\\' and weigh 105 pounds so i got the small. they are a nice length but are a little tight compared to other yoga pants i have. still very comfortable and i love the color. cute pants perfect fit will definitely buy them again in different color. wished there were more colors besides blue though. they appear to be a perfect replacement for what\\'s come off on my m65 jacket. my only wish or &#34;negative&#34; is that i only needed about 8-10, not 100. but the flip side is they aren\\'t overly expensive so it\\'s not a huge deal. i can\\'t wait for my second pair to arrive! this was a splurge for me, i would not normally spend this much for one item of clothing. i\\'ve tried on countless pair of linen pants in stores looking for that cool, relaxed look only to be disappointed because they are too snug around my bottom. the style of these fit the bill (and my butt) and they look great, are so comfortable and well made. i got black and now can\\'t wait for the white pair i ordered to arrive. i bought these scrubs in extra large. they were larger than expected, but with tie waist this was not a huge problem. also, they were thinner fabric than other scrubs that i bought with a similar price range. having said that however, i am quite happy with this purchase. excellent fabric quality, punctual delivery time, colors and size as expected. i recommend.<br /><br />the customer should be free to write the number of characters you want, please modify this form to give feedback, because this uncomfortable. comfy comfy fit nice and they got here right on time too excellent they look great fit fine, but the color is way too close to my own skin tone. i looked like i forgot my pants. i gave them to my daughter and she loves them :) they fit fine but they are very short. have to wear long boots with them. my wife loves them! they fit perfectly. i really like these pants they fit well. i have curves and i\\'m short. i ordered a medium and i love how the material feels. the pants are a little on the slim side  but at $14 each.. i couldn\\'t ask for a better product.<br />these are warm but not too thick. they are slim-fit but that\\'s cool for me. i am an xs and i<br />had no way of knowing how they would fit. these pants are more casual. don\\'t think about dressing them up unless  you tuck these babies into boots<br />the  weight of this fabric is a bit heavier than what you are seeing even at the mass merch stores like gap & h&m.<br />these would be terrific to wear out for  lunch if paired  with a tank  or  plain short or long-sleeve top and then use a hoodie, sweater or a jacket on top of them with boots.  i will say this.. as a person who tried every pair of joggers at gap, this was a better fit and i am wearing them to lounge around house or to take my dog out for a walk.  they don\\'t shrink a lot when washed and they  aren\\'t pilling (yet).<br /><br />i like them so much i am thinking i should buy a couple of pairs more.  at this price 3 pairs would equal the cost of the more upscale joggers! i absolutely love them, they are comportable, very stylish and cool looking, very reasonable for the design and look.  they are great to travel with and lounge with them.  i am planning on purchasing more different colors.  i highly recommend them. love alfred dunner! good product overall. it fits very well, but the fabric is a bit thinner than expected. also there is a bit of sheen to the fabric. will update after a couple of washes. comfortable and easy care. these are the sweetest yoga pants in the world!! the dye job is awesome, and the colors are brilliant. the pants were a little too small though. i always wear a medium sometimes even a small but these are rather small for a medium. i was able to stretch the cotton a bit by running it through a cold wash. regardless of the small fit i still give these pants 5 stars! thanks man! these fit so nicely that i came back and purchased all their colors! i have friends and strangers off the street ask me where i purchased them. the best part is that they are made in the good ole usa ;) this was a comfortable product. this was amazing how good they fit me i want to buy a lot more. im 6\\'1 and its hard to find yoga pants lone enough. these go the distance. based on the spot on reviews from others about the length i took a chance and ordered 2 pairs. im  so glad i did. i liked the pants.  the material was thick which i liked.  they run small so i will be returning the medium for a large.  they run long so i will shorten them.  i am 5 ft and 130 lbs. i love this capri\\'s for working out although i would go up one size. the time to get to me took a little long but i love the pants love them these are definitely a legging and not a jean , very soft fleece like material. .they are pull on without buttonns or a zipper. i personally wouldn\\'t wear these out , for me they are a legging i would wear at home . if you like twilight but don\\'t want your clothes screaming it, this is a nice option. without any reviews to go on i took the chance and bought them. i ordered the m size, i\\'m 5\\'6\\'\\' and they were long. had to hold them up to walk. they are draw string around the waist. i would have preferred elastic. pulled as tight as i could they would still fall right at my hips. probably should have ordered the small. they are definitely not outdoor pants, but i enjoy lounging in them when watching my twilight dvds or reading the books. i still gave it five stars because they are comfy and let me support my love for the series without being obvious. the gerber training pants i bought were too small and fell apart after only a couple of washes.  these training pants are made of thicker, better quality cotton and have held up well through many, many washes (i have 3 preschoolers and i\\'ve had these for over a year).  they feel like thicker underwear, not diapers, and the fit is comfortably roomy.  now, they aren\\'t waterproof and they\\'re not a diaper, so don\\'t expect them to be something they\\'re not, but they are absorbent enough that i only have to deal with wet pants and not a puddle on the floor when there\\'s an accident, which is just what i expect out of training pants.  this lets them experience the natural consequences of not making it to the potty, without as big a mess for me to deal with. i\\'m only 19 weeks pregnant, but already none of my business wear fits. these fit wonderfully  and will be perfect to pair with a blazer. they were so comfy that i didn\\'t want to take them off. i\\'m 5\\'2\\\\\\\\\" and the petite length hit me perfectly. these are so toasty warm and long which we need...bought them for my 6\\'3&#34; son and they are perfect! only wish they had a small size for me! i bought these for work and they are quite comfortable, my only complaint is with the way the cargo pockets are made.  i put small tools and pens in my cargo pockets, when i sit down these things fall out even with the button closed. really like these pants only the color was not what i expected. even though it says khaki, the picture looked more taupe, which was what i was hoping for since i already have a pair this same color. more my fault than anything i suppose. they fall nicely, are very comfortable and true to size. glad i got the medium as it fit a bit large.  not too big but a bit.  is fine with the draw string.  love them just the same.  goes with an iu scrub top i\\'ve had for awhile. awesome work out pants! these were a gift for my mom.  she wanted gray cords and i was happy to find this brand in a petite size.  material is a very soft corduroy. i look great in them! good material, i have not tried washing them yet though. will likely just do it with hair shampoo in cold water. this item came as expected.  the pants are a bit over sized, but that makes them more comfy.  a nice feature the seller has is that we had to sign for the package.  this insured we received our package and not our neighbor.  will definitely do business with again! awesome fit! extremely comfortable ! love the color --- can\\'t wait to get another one - really  good with accessories. great exercise pants just what i needed comfort and room to move freely. i love my yoga pants. i use them for working out or for just relaxing at home. after two washes still my favorite pair of yoga pants. uses them for a holloween costume. 80s aerobic instructor. perfect and comfortable! this belt is amazing,its adjustable to about any size, excellent art, great to look at, and perfect for all captain america fans out there. captain america! shipped ln timeframe it said.  fits well and true to size.  i get lots of compliments off these pants. thank you these fit great! good quality! love them! i guess the company is more suited to older men, but these pants were very large for the size advertized. nice color and make though. so soft, i thought the material would be flimsy or too thin like other reviews had said but it\\'s actually really nice. it does make your butt look good or noticeable but not to an uncomfortable extent. i ordered larger than i am (i\\'m a medium and got large) so it would hang a bit loose and the top is tight but not too tight and the ankles are tight so the only thing baggy is the legs. you literally feel like you can stretch every which way. they aren\\'t restricting in the least. i got two colors. and i\\'m more than pleased with both. i would definitely recommend. soft and comfy.  good quality... these are great party pants! they fit great, look awesome and unfortunately they are partially see through. it\\'s not terrible though. like i said, i think they\\'re great party pants, i would never wear these to class (i\\'m in college) without something covering my bottom. the fit is as expected: i\\'m 5\\'4&#34; and weigh around 120lbs.<br /><br />also, beware the seams aren\\'t awesome. i don\\'t see these pants lasting me too terribly long. but for the price, why not? as the titles suggest these are excellent pants as advertised. however, they come un-hemmed which adds additional cost unless you do it yourself. they are advertised as old style wwii influenced khakis and i have no doubt they are the closest thing you can find presently to that old style pant. however, they are not exactly old style my father had several pairs of older khakis that were more heavy duty than these although the actual pattern/fit is very similar the material is lacking. overall i like these pants and i will see how they wear over time to determine if i buy more. until recently, i\\'ve had trouble finding pants that are both fashionable and conducive to my chosen fighting style (a lethal mix of filipino stick fighting, thai kick boxing, and oklahoma pig grappling). jeans have always proven constrictive, while corduroy chafes. sweatpants are comfortable, but hardly something one would wear out to, say, olive garden or old country buffet.<br /><br />no, i needed something that would enable me to dish out a neck-high snap kick while still looking classy and cool.<br /><br />these are those pants.<br /><br />from the moment i slipped them on, i knew i had found what i had long been searching for. the purple and white zebra pattern is not only stylish, it hypnotizes enemies, giving me an added advantage! and the dangling red drawstring doubles as a fantastic key holder.<br /><br />if you\\'re in the market for pants that not only look and feel great, but allow for maximum kick height and velocity, look no further than zubaz. i\\'ve got a pair for every day of the week! very comfortable and thin good for spring summer my daughter is 7 months and her height is at 98th percentile. so if i would buy something her size, the pants would fall short and would ride up. these pants are just great! they are long enough, very comfortable. perfect if your kido has eczema. these are great.  they are so soft and the pockets are roomy. they are very true to size and i liked the flare at the bottom  they actually do not look like scrubs and they come in lots of colors. i only wish i could have gotten petites, i even have to hem them sometimes, by the time i do i lose some of the flare but they are so soft and so comfy i did not even care. i love these -- they\\'re worth the price, as they really, truly don\\'t show panty lines except under very rare circumstances. it\\'s hard to find full-coverage panties that don\\'t look stuffy, and these are still sexy and beautiful! pretty, but a little too short. i have long legs love these. great weight, stretchy fit. fit great! and we\\'re long enough without swallowing me!! a bit small, but not uncomfortable to wear. c: still love it~ awsomeüëå i was looking for the older brand of twenty years ago lol training pants so i ordered this brand.  of course time has changed and so has the underwear.  they are not as thick in the front at the older type and they are not as thick on the side.  the ones from back when the sides you were not able to see the skin but these you can but is not a lot.  i might not have noticed if i did not have some of the back when underwear.     in all of that, it works as it is better than not having the underwear.  they are true to size and once you get it home and wash it, they shrink.  they arrive larger and shrink to the perfect size.  i say they are true to size as i guess they are true to size for my 4 year old angel.  his pant size is in between a 3t and 4t so we bought him the 4t.  despite its shortcomings, i ordered three more sets. nice pattern. love these. my son is 18 months and 30 lbs and these fit perfectly. they are soft and thick. the matching plastic pants that go with them are too big in the same size unfortunately. these are great for winter. they are thick, fleece lined leggings. they still fit tightly to your body and keep you really warm! very soft and comfortable for the baby. love these pants! we purchased for a wedding and they fit perfectly! they were the perfect pants we were looking for. i love them theyes are very comfortable  and i plan on buying more in different  colors. these pants were true to size.  i don\\'t understand how i can order 2 pairs of pants in the same size and have one fit perfectly and the other be too small.  the pants from amazon (tan) fit very well and the ones fron think fast are too small.  it was not cost effective to return them due to the postage. fit just fine they are somewhat see threw but still wear them i recently purchased the brown pair of these pants, and i loved them, i am 37 weeks pregnant and i just loved how the brown ones fit, the length was perfect they fit great, so i also wanted to the black ones as well.  i have to say, i am a tall gal (5\\'10&#34;) and the black ones fit fine, just a little shorter. maybe they are cut different.  they still feel great and i love them, these pants  are a good buy. i will continue to wear these pants, but i favor the brown pair for sure. so cute! i took them to get altered - about four inches taken off and the seamstress is going to use the extra material to make an aplique for a shirt. fit as expected and arrived on time. they are a little long and unhemmed. will need to have them hemmed or cutoff. but otherwise they are beautiful. these are the cutest and most comfortable pants ever...i feel like i dream of jeannie! definitely buying more but i cannot decide on which color because i know they will all look great! s/o to the customer staff they are awesome! very cute & comfy! these jeans are very comfortable, and they are like wearing pajama bottoms!  the fit was perfect for me, appreciated the long length.  thank you. love these. the colors are vibrant and the material isn\\'t sheer like other leggings. i\\'ve only worn them to a rave and they were great. good fit first of all, this pants is made in u.s.a.!  yes!  i\\'m very happy to finally see some product is made in u.s.!  i\\'m sick of all our products are made in china!  i don\\'t buy made in china products, unless unless i really need the item and really don\\'t have a choice.<br /><br />i\\'m 5\\'3\\\\\\\\\" around 120lb.  i ordered a small petite.  it fits great at the waist.  it\\'s not binding, but not loose either.  unlike the picture, the length is &lt; 1\\\\\\\\\" shorter than i\\'ve expected  i guess it really depending on your inseam, but height doesn\\'t matter.  my inseam is about 30.  i guess this pants is 29\\\\\\\\\" (i haven\\'t measure them).  the material is not soft enough the way i like.  the reason is that this is nylon, but i usually like to have polyester mixed in.  if the material is a mixing of mostly polyester, nylon and lycra, and offering inseam 29\\\\\\\\\" 30\\\\\\\\\" 31\\\\\\\\\" 32\\\\\\\\\" 33\\\\\\\\\", with this perfect tailoring, this pants will be perfect for everything!  however, this pants is really flattering!  hope they offer more color too.<br /><br />one less star is because of the length which is a bit short, and the stiffness of the material.  also, it took too long for them to ship the product.  it took 2 weeks and 1 day till i received it. i love it and everyone i wore it around had to know where i got it.  cute and comfortable :) good quality, comfy, as expected. i\\'m 5\\'2 and 125, and its the right amount of snug. very stretchy. also, included a thoughtful note from the seller, and a little unexpected something else, which makes the purchasing experience that much better. shipped from zhejiang, so expect a week or so for delivery. found quality as expected. my son loved these pajama pants.  fit was great!  very comfortable! unbelievably comfortable!!! i am 5\\'4 and the length is perfect as a romper. wish they had a bigger selection! so happy with my purchase :) i bought a pair of capri-length wrap pants while on a recent vacation, and love them so much i decided i needed another pair. these wrap pants are perfect for yoga because they move how you do without bunching, but are also great for just lounging around. the lavender and pink colors are very pretty, and i like the fact that these are ankle-length. i also bought the tan pair as a gift. if you\\'ve never worn them, be aware that they are supposed to be very large around the waist prior to tieing them, a \\\\\\\\\"one-size-fits-all\\\\\\\\\" item. great fit and feel. i will order more! too shiny i ordered this pant in every available colour! the price is reasonable! and they fit very well! these palazzo pants are absolutely beautiful and comfortable. the fabric is soft and cozy in a hot humid atmosphere. perfect for summer. i\\'m a 5\\'8&#34; tall and the length of pants is not floor length nor was it too short. this item is good for tall individuals otherwise it would be floor length and might have to adjust. my waist is 28 and i got a small. fit was exact...the colors were the same as picture i like being able to purchase clothes online and they fit as expected, will be buying more real soon ty extremely soft and comfortable. it was a xmast present for my wife (as she got tmnt pjs for the kids so now they all match) and she really seems to enjoy them nice jeans.  fit perfectly! my first-ever \\'clubwear\\' purchase.  they are a great, tight fit (i\\'m 5-10 and 140).  i\\'ll wear these at burning man and then they will probably be put away for 51 weeks. thanks so much i have 4 month old that is over 20 pounds so i ordered the 12 to 18 month size.  it\\'s a bit snug over any clothing like a onesie but over a diaper it fits fine.  very cute!  i\\'m pretty sure it\\'s typically not a problem. i bought my daughter the tee shirt last year and decided to get her the lounge pants to go with it. i am combining it with other bbt merchandise to make a fantastic gift! i stumbled across the brand rather haphazardly looking for pants for my nearly one year old that had elastic around the ankles.  poor guy has short legs, like his mother, and needs something that wouldn\\'t slide down over his feet and make him stumble.  i ordered him 6 of these shirts, a vest, and 5 pairs of pants/leggings, all susu & cra.  i was so pleasantly surprised when i opened up our shipment.  the quality of this brand is comparable to gymboree and hanna andersson clothing.  the cotton knits are quite thick in their &#34;peach&#34; knit shirts and a little thinner in their basic shirts, but still substantial.  all items are superb in their construction.  i will be coming back for more items as my son grows.  these are great mixable and matchable basics, and if you order a bib or vest, you\\'ve got an outfit like no other.  korean clothing, as compared to &#34;made in china&#34; or &#34;bangladesh&#34;, and even some &#34;made in the usa&#34; clothing is exceptional in it\\'s quality.  a lot of thought was put into these items.  an added plus, was they sent me a bib, for free, to try, that coordinated perfectly with the items i ordered.  we\\'ve received lots of compliments while out and about with my son, wearing his susu & cra garments.  this is the perfect brand to pass on between siblings, as with gymboree and ha, they are so well made that they don\\'t look like hand me downs. love it. one of the best buys i could\\'ve made for myself for this winter! i highly recommend these! slim profile and goes under my jeans and my riding breeches. definitely would recommend to anyone looking for an extra layer of warmth to add to your wardrobe. overall this pant is a good buy. the material of the waist band and the pant itself is super comfortable and soft. the only things i didn\\'t quite like are that they are pretty see through when actually doing your yoga, and they are actually a teensy bit shorter than i thought they would have been.  from other reviews i thought they would have been planty long, as i am not very tall, but they aren\\'t too short either so it\\'s not really a big deal.  price was right for the product. thanks so much a bit snug about the waist and not the most stylish pants, but they\\'re soooooo comfortable. i wish i could wear them every day. very flattering, fits well and kept me suprisingly warm as they are actually thin.  if you get the white ones, be careful what color jeans you wear them with.  my dark blue jeans stained them and they won\\'t bleach out.  doesn\\'t bother me as no one else will really see the &#34;seat.&#34;  i love the front and the way it holds everything - the support is great especially if you don\\'t like your junk going everywhere. good quality, they are a little long for 5\\'4 love these!  comfy, look great.  maybe an inch too short (i am 5\\'6&#34;), am a thick girl, its kinda see tru wants ur in a colour underwear other than that i love it, its very comfortable... bought these as a gift and he seems to love them! these joggers are cute,  comfy feeling, and the new it.  i haven\\'t worn out yet only tried them on so i can\\'t rate on how they feel after washing and color fade. it\\'s soft and nice very nice pant good quality love these pants! the fit is good, a little more relaxed around the thighs than some of the other yoga pants i have. however, the material isn\\'t as extraordinary as some of the reviews mentioned. but it\\'s good, definitely above average and they wash well- so no complaints! if u are looking for a snug fit (esp around the butt and thighs), a bit like compression pants, i\\'d recommend the cordiu t-party heavy weight pants. [[asin:b00cktwqro cordiu heavy weight t-party fold over yoga pants]] the first pair i got had a stain on them, but the company sent me a new pair. the fit is good and i like the bling on the button. the color isn\\'t as dark as i would have liked, but that\\'s ok. i do have to be careful when i pull them on as the belt loops seem like i could rip them off. overall, for the price they are good. love them very comfy will buy more excellent construction and material. lots of detail, including pockets and drawstring hems. my grandson loved these! i would definitely buy them again. super long. i\\'m 5\\'1 and i had to cut off about 6 inches off the bottom for them to fit correctly good quality soft fabric, bright color<br />so satisfied i highly recommend these skirted leggings because they are made of a thick knit material that feels super soft.  they fit nicely through the hips, and are short enough that they don\\'t bunch up, i\\'m 5\\'3\\\\\\\\\" and they are a good length.  i would imagine average height women 5\\'5\\\\\\\\\" or so, could wear these comfortably as there is stretch in the material.  i normally wear a size small 4-6 us size, so i ordered the asian xl, the fit is very nice.  probably could try the large, but i prefer a relaxed fit through the waist.  i\\'ve ordered these in another color so i have two pair. fit as expected. i wear a size 8 usually, so i ordered the large. they fit perfectly. the waist is perfect, comes up to my belly button. the length is just right too, a couple inches above my ankle. the fabric 95% polyester and 5% spandex, feels like soft stretchy cotton. these pants move and glide with your body. they are firm fitted, with back pockets. button close with a zipper. if you are looking for a comfy, cute pair of capris, these are them. i highly recommend them.<br />i received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review. opinions are my own. good fit fit is good, the first time i wore them i got a black soot all over my hands. hopefully after i wash it that doesn\\'t happen anymore. these pants are exactly what i expected. the fit and length is perfect. the only thing i could say is that you definitely have to take your time putting them on as the material seems easily destroyable. they\\'re not cheap so to speak, just the &#34;leather&#34; material is not like your typical legging. i am 5\\'8&#34; 140lbs and i chose to get the large from reading other reviews of them running small. perfect choice! i am definitely happy about my purchase. i love every pair i get from these sellers. they always fit awesomely, and last for quite a while. just be sure to follow those care instructions! it is sucha cool outf it i love it love it.  i will recommend it to all i know it is super cute!!! i\\'m a big person, 6\\'3, 250lbs. in my size (40x34) i have never found a pair of pants that make me look as good as these pants do. i\\'ve bought more expensive stuff and cheaper stuff from all sorts of stores and never once have found something that drapes as well as these pants.<br />they are extremely high quality for the price and i highly suggest any of you try them who have trouble finding pants that look like they were made for you.<br />if you have a nordstrom in your area i would also suggest trying them on at the store. you won\\'t be disappointed. although i\\'m fairly short, i have long legs and it\\'s very rare that regular length pants are too long for me.  these pants are quite long and of course given the material, it\\'s unlikely they\\'ll shrink.  i also ordered up because i know spandex yoga pants tend to be tighter and they\\'re still a little tighter than i like them to.  keeping those things in mind, they\\'re not bad pants. it will not give you a butt if you don\\'t already have one, but it\\'s sexy comfortable and flattering. i plan on buying more.<br /><br />i just wish it had front pockets. bought these as a christmas present for my daughter.  she loves them and it makes me a &#34;rock star&#34;  for buying them for her! i bought these for my nursing clinicals to save money. they were well worth it, but the pants were very big. i ordered an xs set, and the top fits perfectly but the pants feel more like a medium. fits as expected. these pants are one of my favorites.  i\\'m  5\\'8&#34;, 143 - 145lbs,  with long legs.  these pants are nice and long, and a medium fits perfectly.  they look a bit like stretch jeans, but are actually more like yoga pants.  the material is light, so don\\'t be looking for warmth on a cold evening.. but for mild weather days - they are great.  best to hang dry - but when put thru the dryer - they are still ok - only a bit snugger.  i\\'ve bought 15 of these, in various colors, because i\\'m afraid they\\'ll stop making them. my 3 pair of lulumon\\'s  are thicker, warmer,  less comfortable, and not as flattering.  the only reason i haven\\'t given them 5 stars is because the stitching in the crotch area - of some of them - came undone. (it might just be me, i sit cross-legged a lot)  i took them to my local seamstress, and for $7.00 each; these pants have gone on to be like new.  that may sound bad, but for the price , even with the stitching done - they are a deal. i was skeptical cus of some of the reviews so i only ordered 1, but i like the fit, i ordered a size over so i can alter it if need be.  hope more of them become available again cus i wanna order a couple more... these are nice pants, somewhat snug in the thighs, and as other reviewers stated, quite long., but they will work for the price. i love hard tail yoga clothing because it is organic, fits my body perfectly (i am a size small),  is comfortable  and looks great!  i will definitely be purchasing more hard tail, especially the foldover  pants. product was received quickly, i was pleased with that.  however,  i can\\'t review the product success or failure regarding stretch because the plastic material is weak.  the company qa department needs to check it out further and add a \\\\\\\\\"stop\\\\\\\\\" on the screw knob to prevent the plastic from breaking.    step one in the instructions are clear, but without the above suggested \\\\\\\\\"stop\\\\\\\\\", the instructions should include a warning.  the \\\\\\\\\"front clamp\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\"screw knob\\\\\\\\\" allow too much torque on the the plastic rod...the plastic rod simply popped in half, rendering the product useless.      next step will be to see if the company stands behind their product or not.    [[asin:b001gt347u waistband stretcher & extender stretch tight pants and jeans]] these khakis are wonderful,soft but very durable.  the transaction was flawless.  thank you.    jim i am 5-6, medium built, waist 30. the suit jackets i wear a 38s even though i can fit into a 36. the tux size i purchase is 38s. the jacket fits perfectly. the length goes down to about the back of my knee, where its suppose to be. the front is a tad above my waist line, which is where its suppose to be. you are not able to button this jacket though i\\'m sure you can modify it to fit. the material is very well. its hard and sturdy. the jacket has some weight into it. there are a few pockets on the inside as well.<br /><br />now with tailcoat tuxedo, there is a morning and evening one. i didn\\'t know about this before i purchase. i am not sure which one this falls under actually. usually with morning ones, they have a lot of buttons and you usually can\\'t button them. with the evening tailcoat, there are usually 2-3 buttons and you can button the jacket. this jacket has 3 button and you can\\'t button them. however, that is just very nitty gritty and i am 100% certain that majority of the people won\\'t even know the difference.<br /><br />the pants that came with it is size 32 for this jacket. its slightly roomy for me, but not bad. the only thing i\\'m not 100% sure is that the pants are a bit wider than my suit pants. though, most of my suit pants are fitted. however, when i put the whole outfit together, it doesn\\'t look bad. i have another pair of tuxedo pants which are slimmer than this one, so i may try out both of them and see which looks better.<br /><br />i doubt the legs are wider because the waist is 32. there shouldn\\'t be too much difference between leg space for waist 30 and 32. overall, for the price, i am satisfied with the purchase. the shipping was spectacular with amazon prime. i bought a few of these pants and really like them. the material is very soft and comfortable. the only thing i don\\'t like is that the feet are too small. it\\'s not a major deal and doesn\\'t limit the comfort but it\\'s somewhat annoying because you\\'d expect the feet to be be cut appropriate to age-size. fits perfectly. it\\'s nice and comfortable. also great during wet and cold weather. the strap at the bottom keeps the pants from going up which would otherwise be very distracting. very good!!!!! recommended the item is well made and very durable, will last for years to come. read about the good quality and fit and it exceeded my expectations! i am a size 10 with non-skinny thighs and the medium fit perfectly. the customer service was excellent- responded and addressed my concerns promptly. i had a sizing issue and was able to exchange for the right size with a shipping refund. will definitely do business with the company again. this 3 piece outfit is stunning, a beautiful combination of teal & silver. slacks & tank are fully lined & fabric lining is very soft.  i ordered ex-large, it was a perfect fit and looks like &#34;a million bucks&#34;.  i am very pleased with both delivery & product. they fit nice comfortable pants , great price ,i would buy again. didn\\'t shrink or loose there color . thanks soft, cute and easy to wash. the only complaint would be the leg ends tend to roll down in ackward angles. i started buying kicky pants for my daughter when she was born.  she wears the long sleeved onsie under her pajamas at night, and they create a wonderfully silky-soft layer against her skin. they wear incredibly well through many washes and dries, and they are so stretchy that she has been able to wear smaller sizes way past their marked size recommendations. i\\'m now expecting a boy, and have already stocked up on all sizes through 18 months. they are far and away my baby garment of choice. love, love, love!!! just great too! they are very comfortable. this is my second pair. if you tend to wear costumes (for me that\\'s halloween and a few parties a year) than it\\'s good to have a &#34;costume stock&#34;. these pants should be a part of that stock. viking, pirate, clown, gypsy ... as long as historical accuracy is not on your agenda these pants fit into all those categories.<br /><br />fit good, comfy, not too hot, versatile. no pockets, drawstring, button cuffs around ankles (left unbuttoned i\\'ve pulled them up just below knees for my pirate costume). the only con is no fly for easy #1 bathroom breaks. i was extremely happy with these pants. they were of great quality and fit true to size! i received them earlier than the expected delivery date as well. grand daughter loved the gift. much better than expected. while it is unfortunate that you can\\'t remove the chains, or zip off the bottoms (why design the pants to be zipped off into shorts if you can\\'t remove the chains), the pants are excellent as pants. besides how long it took too arrive i was very happy with the emoji pants ‚≠ê soft and comfortable. they\\'re so so soft and so comfortable! they\\'re not see through like most leggings and they\\'re not baggy or like skin tight. they\\'re just right i used to buy these down at venice beach back in the early 90\\'s. back then they had different patterns so while these have a more basic look, they feel and fit great. perfect stuff for a gym workout or even as casual wear. after about 10 washings the material gets a little&#34; pilly&#34;, but if they are your workout pants who cares.  i would think at this price, the material would have greater lasting power. i still love them happy with product and delivery. the size was very accurate when i ordered it. i wore them today when it was 40f and snowing like a blizzard in virginia. weird weather we\\'re having... haha<br /><br />these pants kept away the cold and the wind very well. i would recommend this to anyone looking for a pair of reliable snow pants. they feel really light! i wish the pockets were higher up, but it\\'s no big deal. nothing feels as good as a great pair of sweat pants. makes you want to curl up and read a good book. perfect for my daughter for work. very comfortable my daughter loves them. i love these pants. they\\'re perfect for any performance! it was my error for not noting the length on these before purchase. i love them, they fit well in the waist and are comfortable but the length is just a bit too short for me. i ended up rolling up the legs a bit but not good for the winter weather that  we are having now. would buy more if longer. i simply live these! oh my god, the material is amazing, it looks so good on me and i will buy another pair, but different color. i will recommend to all my girl friends! this is absolutely amazing!!!!! love it! &#60;3 &#60;3 bought these for my mother.  she loves them and says they are very comfortable.  the size is perfect for her, as she is a petite. these are nice looking capri cargo style pants.  the are comfortable and fit well everywhere but the length.  if you are a petite person or have short legs they just really don\\'t look right on.  the price is very reasonable and i would reorder them if they had a petite size. i love these pants. i have had several surgeries in my abdomen area and these are the only pants i can wear with out hurting my scars.<br /><br />they also don\\'t add any more lumps in my back. lol , easy to care for. i had yoga pants from wal-mart that fit really well, size large. i bought these in a large as well and they are tighter than the wal-mart ones. i did find they were a bit sheer when stretched around \\\\\\\\\"thunder thighs\\\\\\\\\". i am 5\\'6\\'\\' and about 150lbs. great length and i am sure a better fit when i lose a few pounds :) these held up very well at a professional workplace for several months. with cold machine wash and line dry, they are in good enough shape to wear for another pregnancy.<br /><br />the petite fit is truly petite--i usually have to hem pants (29&#34; inseam) but these fit great. i am very happy want to buy more i really liked the pants they are not real tight around the legs but fit nicely around the waist.  at first these outfits were huge on my daughter.  she is a smaller baby when i ordered them she was 7lbs 4oz, 20in. now she is a month old and they fit perfect she is 21.5 in and probably over 8lbs.  i like that there are snaps at the openings of the onesies too. putting things over my baby\\'s head is the hardest part of dressing her so having a bigger opening is a plus. high quality for those of us who crash through brush.  i\\'ve ordered 3 of them at different times, that\\'s the best recommendation any one could have.  why would you order 3 of anything if they went great? cute beautiful linen pants and the quality is just as described plain and simple great. the style is elegant and pretty but i think they run in the small side, i do recommend on to check the chart available before you place your order to avoid the :( later.   i know for sure that i\\'ll be ordering again from vivid. i love these yoga pants they are so soft and comfortable! definitely<br />my most favorite casual wear! they fit perfect hold their shape and<br />are great for wearing around the house! i am 26 weeks now and was in need of some good work pants! i had purchased size medium jeans from motherhood maternity a few weeks ago, and they said i\\'d be a medium in all of their products. these in a size medium fit perfectly and are so comfortable for my growing bump, the material is wonderful as well, soft and lays nicely! i should have purchased these sooner, i absolutely love them :) awesome. they fit so nice. when i first opened them up i looked at them like &#34;really?!? these are too small&#34; then i tried them on and its a perfect fit. i ordered medium and normally wear a 7-9 in pants. i love them. so comfy. great jeans. they provide a unique look and a great fit. i\\'ll definitely be purchasing more in the future here. i love fleece pajama bottoms, and these are perfect. i love the color and print, and they fit just right. i bought these leggings for the purpose of durable tights while layering and they suit that purpose perfectly.<br />they are comfortable, not itchy, very stretchy they easily fit me and my size 11 butt. the stars get pulled out of shape the wider you are but that is typical of patterns on any tights.<br />down side: the smell horrible right out of the package. they smell like rubber tires and motor oil. i have no idea why but the concentrated essence of jiffy lube permeates these pants. i have washed them once and it is considerably better i can only hope it disappears entirely. these are awesome!  i want them in every color.  for a harem style pant they are really flattering.  i got a lot of compliments on them & they are really comfortable. i am satisfied with my order as a long time iowan, i do love these pants.  i like to wear them for more formal occassions, like state fairs and weddins.  i couldn\\'t give them five stars because they have no american flag on them.     recommend these[[asin:b000lkln28 o500 otomix baggy workout gym pants - american flag]] for everyone from the good old united states of america ... and for those of us who work out ... and also for anyone who rides a gsxr motorcycle ... oh yeah, and if you like ac/dc. i absolutely love wallflower jeans, so i was thrilled when i found that they also made work pants. so much more comfortable than dickies for people like me who have curves. the only downside is that they fit about a size smaller than the jeans do so i would recommend ordering a size bigger than your normal jean size. i am 5\\' 3&#34; and a pair of petite pants i did not have to hem. loved the coral color perfect pants for our color guard! thank you! good quality, good fit. my daughter who is 5\\' 6&#34; needed her size large hemmed a bit - but that was ok. they are very comfy too! excellent i like them i didnt think theyd be as tight around my thighs as they were but theyre wonderful nonetheless the size was already expected to be small due to the reviews i had previously viewed. but even one size up was a little tighter then expected. but all in all a nice pant and i am satisfied with my purchase. üòä i must say i was scared at first to purchase these because im a thicker football built male originally a 36 waste an big butt and thighs i just got my pants today and they are perfect i cant wait to rock em this saturday at my party. thaaaaaaanks customer service good. no problem with return these are so soft i\\'m writting this review and i think is the first. i always read what others have to write and i hope this helps you with your decision.  i order this snow  pants so i can go sledding with my son, but i ended up using them prior, since, we ended up having 12&#34; of snow.  i had to go out and shovel it.  i  wear a large an found the size  comfortable with an inch or more extra. which help, having my regular pants under.  after being outside for about 3 hours at 20 degrees i found them warm and very dry, i specially love the fleeced liner and the 5 pockets, specially the cargo pockets, i like the material which is like a regular jacket\\'s nylon and they are soft as that. i hope you find this helps your decision. they are really good for volleyball they rise up in the back because i have somewhat of a big butt so this would fit great besides that enjoyed wearing thes white cotton knit pant this summer.  so comfy love them will be getting more! i am repeatedly a repeat customer of naartjie clothing. amazing quality. sizing is dead on. prices are great. shipping is reasonable and everything comes packaged quite nicely. a truly unique aesthetic for kids. i especially appreciate the styles because logos aren\\'t demanding all the attention. super awesome graphics that are age appropriate and not edgy, violent or too grown like most kids clothing these days. i wish for you to produce clothing in even larger sizes....as i can\\'t get my kids to stop growing! i\\'ll be sad when they grow out of your sizing charts! i bought a medium and i think they are a little see through, but i am also 23 weeks pregnant so i\\'m sure they won\\'t be as see through when i lose a little weight. over all nice i bought these in black, green, nude, and red.  the brighter colors are fun to wear. these are high-waisted, to the bellybutton and i have to roll them down a little to keep them inside my pants. however, they are very comfortable (!!!) and they offer no visible panty lines--even in your tightest jeans...which was my goal when buying these. the fabric is on the thicker side, but not heavy enough to wear alone. use only as underpants. they make your butt look really nice and smooth--so much better than a thong!  i would also recommend these as better coverage underpants underneath sheer summer skirts, shorts, and dresses. note: pantyliners don\\'t stick very well to the fabric. these pants are very comfortable and are of high quality.  i love the foldover waist pants.  i wear them for working out, walking the dog, or lounging around my house after work. good for the price and the feel of quality of the material. i haven\\'t worn out yet because i am 9months pregnant but when i put them on i could button and they didn\\'t give me muffin tops. i will be purchasing more colors just wish they had white. suuuuper soft on the inside. a little snug on the bum, but otherwise super comfy. i love this romper! it is just as pictured.  the quality is good and fits great! i can\\'t to wear this when the weather gets warmer. love i love these. can be worn casually or dressy. fit as expected. love love love i would give more than 5 stars if possible! these are the best pajamas in the universe. they are sooooooo soft! this is my second pair- i was given a baby body suit that my daughter outgrew. i was so happy to find the brand on amazon! they run a little small so buy one size bigger. i wish my pj\\'s were as soft as this! fits perfectly.<br />i got a size small, i am 5\\'5 and weigh about 100 lbs.<br />they are a bit long, but other than that, they are great.<br /><br />the material is soft and nice, and they are comfy. at first i was very hesitant to purchase any clothing online because i couldn\\'t try on the item. i ordered a medium and was afraid it would be too small but they fit perfectly and are so comfortable!!!! i\\'m very happy with these and they are the only ones that have ever fit me length wise.<br /> i always buy yoga pants at target but i\\'m short (5\\'5) so i walk all over the bottom of the pants and rip them lol. these stay above my feet and are not too thick like some. these are thin enough to not make me sweat but thick enough that i can wear them out in pubic.<br />i got the green and i will be ordering additional colors soon! :) i got these for the misses (she loves crazy pattern stuff), and she is very happy with them. she likes the fold over waist band and the material they are made out of. the material is extremely soft, almost like a thin velvet.  for the price, if you want some crazy looking legs that are super soft and comfortable these fit the bill. i love the pants.the joggers are good quality pants. only problem is the sizing runs too small. one size up is not enough. however i did find someone to buy them from me. work on sizing and this will become a hot item.  jackie s. this is really cute & the material is good quality. the only thing i didn\\'t like is the length is a bit short. i ordered s/m. i\\'m 5\\'5. it\\'s about 2 inches short. exactly as pictured. i\\'m 5\\'4&#34; and its a little long so look extra baggy bit still very cute. great and comfy maternity outfit that can be work after! these are the most comfortable pants i own.  after i bought this one pair i started searching for more.  unfortunately, classic closeouts did not offer them again so i looked on ebay and found them and bought two more pairs.     i love the style and the fit.  the fabric is lightweight, has just the right amount of stretch and holds its shape very well.  they are exactly what i was looking for!!  when my best friend saw them she immediately bought two pair herself.     classic closeouts shipped very quickly.  i am 100% pleased with the entire transaction. the t-shirt came in a timely fashion and was exactly what i ordered. very nice!itwill be used as a night shirt thus the reason i ordered very large. i love it! fits perfect and feels great wearing it. i want every color! so cute and with room to grow. i purchased the &#34;wine&#34; colored pants because just about every athletic piece of clothing i have is somewhat black, mostly black, or accented with black and grey and more black.<br /><br />the quality is superb! it feels like a nice thick cotton/jersey blend, and the pant holds and retains its shape very well (so they don\\'t bag up at the knees). i\\'ve literally washed these pants dozens of times! they\\'ve held up extremely well.<br /><br />these have a low cut waste, so i personally would never wear them outside or for running or other sport activities. but they do work well for after workout wear and i have also used them for layering in colder weather.<br /><br />these pants are shorter, just like you see in the picture, they rest a few inches above the ankle. i am 5 8, approx. 147 lbs i got a m, and they fit comfortably. love the lightweight fabric for hot humid ohio summers.  i have a 44 inch waste and and 55 inch hips.  no problem with these pants. i still have room in them.  can\\'t wait to wear to the summer outdoor concerts . awesome very comfy like lots of sport denim, the added stretchability comes at a cost. these feel less breathable and are quite stiff.<br /><br />they are really good though and now the weather has cooled down, these are getting lots of wear. the double layered gusset means less likelihood of shredding you know where. more for fall/winter.<br /><br />the reflective material sewn into the inside of the cuff is great. so when you make a turn up you produce some effective reflectors. nice nice nice<br /><br />fits my skier/cyclist thighs well<br /><br />citi riders may enjoy the lock strap that\\'s cunningly built in to the rear left of the waist belt<br /><br />originally i put 4 stars because they are not perfect. but not far off.<br /><br />how to better?<br />reinforced cuff (on the chain side)<br />softer feel excellent! just what i needed. my wife loved hers so much that we ordered two more pair in a size larger when we found out she was pregnant. after a long day... or reading on the couch on a rainy sunday... or doing chores or yard work... these are her go-to pants. they\\'ve been washed weekly for months and are holding up well. sizes appear to be true but note that they are form-fitting around the back, as yoga pants typically are (compared to sweatpants). will buy these again. this is a great product.  been using since they first came out.<br /><br />if you need closet space, this is it. these are great scrubs, although they run a little small.  next time i will order the next size up. love it! i\\'m pregnant and it looks really cute! i always get lots if compliments with it and is really comfortable. i like how i can dress it up or casual it was duly dlievered and it is very comfortable, particularly when you are travelling because it is very light and easy to carry. thank you! love love love these pants.  i had so many compliments in one day.  the quality is great and the fit is better than i expected.  i am 5\\'8&#34; and i ordered the small and was the perfect fit for me.  i would definitely order again. yes, it\\'s pricey, but it is hands down the snuggliest onesie out there. i love putting my son in these and snuggling with him. you feel baby, not clothes. i have purchased 4 now and wish there were more/cuter boy colors available. consider this a snuggle treat for yourself. love these! very soft and stretchy. i bought these for my 17 month old because we\\'ve been practicing ec and i want him to be aware of his pee-pee. i love how the underpants look, so cute, and super soft and comfy.  please note though, that they really don\\'t absorb very much pee, and there will be a lot of mopping up to do. again, for ec i think its helpful, because he definitely knows that he has peed, and will tell me, while with the super absorbent types he just keeps on going.  so i give 5 stars for cute and comfiness, and maybe 1 1/2 for absorbancy! can their possibly be a finer pair of pants for cruising for some sweet trim at a flea market? i think not sir! very happy with this pair of pants.  extremely comfortable, but durable enough for sports activities or in the gym.  definitely will be purchasing more in the future! i can\\'t say enough good things about these footies. the cotton fabric is super soft and comfy for my baby\\'s delicate skin and they look super cute. i\\'ll definitely be ordering more in other colors. absolutely love the fit, the way they support my &#34;parts&#34;. very soft and warm! enjoy hanging around the house wearing only these. they fit great and didn\\'t fall apart in the wash! they are not see through but the material is thin and silky, i wear long underwear under them in the winter for a little extra warmth. arrived much sooner than the estimated delivery date, will buy from this seller again! my son loves them. they are light weight and comfortable. my girlfriend really liked them! love them. they create a great sweat. they run a little big, wish i had ordered a small. good material my husband loved these! love this brand and the quality they provide!  i found these pants to be a bit large, but still wearable and leaves a little more room to grow which is fine by me!  my daughter is 24in and 10.5lbs.  for a baby who is thinner, these might be too big still but for a baby with cute little baby thighs, these would still work! i like them people say i look like a clown in them lol loved the material and patterns.  would like to see more like these. love there\\'s coral color palazzo pants excellent material but it&#34;s a little baggy. well-made and comfortable, not much else to say.  better than your average cotton t. turn out better than expected. nice pants, fits reaaalllly good. 17 year old daughter lobs them. made well. worth the money. would order again. these leggings are sexy!  they fit well, have just enough stretch to be comfortable, and look so sleek with heels, flats, boots, etc.  i wear these with everything and i love how they feel like leather!  they also wash well and i get tons of compliments on them.  i looked high and low for a pair of faux leather leggings and i am so pleased with these.  the price is awesome too! its clean, it reminds me of the 90\\'s.... and generation rx....<br />tripp nyc kicks..... keep going..... word up.....<br />chill it.... very cute leggings, good quality and true to size. within the first hour of putting these pants on i got 3 different people complementing me and asking me where i got them!<br />i love these pants, they are super comfortable, and you can dress them up or dress them down! great pants that doesn\\'t fit baggy. gives a nice &#34;fitted&#34; fit without being restrictive in the crotch. i use these for work, hunting, and shooting. very versatile pair of pants. my son loves these.  they are comfortable my son loved his shirt great fit and look.  they arrived as promised.  i already recommended to someone else.  have received several compliments.  went over well at a recent party. no complaints except the length. i am 5.8&#34;/117 lbs and they fit closer to a capri length on me. waist line is too high as on any other leggings purchased from amazon. i have to fold it in two times, but ill keep them. very comfortable rec\\'d merchandise as described and to be of first quality material and workmanship.  extremely pleased with both quality and value. perfect fit! i got these during rainy season in sacramento and was excited to wear them, but lost them, so i never did.  ok, i wore them once, in the house, to try them on.  they were a bit baggy, but they\\'re made for over clothes wear so that\\'s ok.  they felt like sandbag material but hey, if i\\'m staying dry, then it\\'s not a big deal.  if only i could find them... these are some amazing pants, their really nice and comfortable and fit me really well and their is a tighting  strap around ur ankle so they don\\'t sag down which i really like u should buy this item i love these leggings! i didn\\'t notice the smell that everyone stated. my sister is very happy. at first i thought they would not fit because she has thick legs although they look great on her and she is very happy.<br />i recommend this product. got a pair in the blue color, they are some what in the slim fit but they are well made, i mean it\\'s all relative to the price! i usually wear a size m - these fit great - lots of room - elastic waistband gives plenty of stretch - fabric is a little thin - perfect for warm weather - they are stylish or you can wear them as pajamas or to workout in. versatile. these are nice and roomy in the leg.  i got a small (i wear a size 2 in pants, so i thought it would be a safe bet), and i think the waist is pretty small.  i had to cut the drawstring out to avoid uncomfortable cinching.  it\\'s still a little tight, but at least i don\\'t have to worry about it falling down during my zumba class.  i do wish that they were a 1/2&#34; longer.  they reach to the top of my sneakers, but this is a personal preference.  the material is really nice, soft and durable.  it holds sweat well without getting heavy.  plus, they make my rear end look pretty good. full length long enough for a taller person.... perfect length.  i am 5\\' 3&#34;.  comfortable waist band.  quality seems very good.  more $ than i would normally spend but hopefully worth it. came as described and a great value. i keep my set in with my mountain biking gear for the winter and look forward to using them. love these pants! these 3/4 length pant work for everything. yoga, running, climbing, hiking.. all good and look great through many washings. panel crop pant in olive is our fave but it also comes in other colors.  very soft and looks great with hightops or flipflops. i love any of the kicky pants products. they are super soft, durable, breathable, light. the sets are great b/c i mix them up with other shirts or pants, use them as pj\\'s, etc. i have some combination of the pants, pj\\'s (w/ footies and without), and onsie\\'s in literally every color they come in. they are true size-wise and last until he grows out of them- then i order him the next size up. and they are great for the environment too! i really love these for comfort! love these pants! they\\'re so comfortable! just beware, if you actually wear them to yoga, you might get a little bit of a wedgy from time to time, but it\\'s not a big deal and i usually wear them anyway. i sleep in them too sometimes! i saw these a couple years ago and fell in love with the concept. being in childbearing years, the more i can streamline my wardrobe to keep from having to swap out maternity, nursing and normal wear the better!  this busy momma doesn\\'t have time or the space for all that.<br /><br />i finally bought my first pair and got them today.  i was so excited i put them on immediately.  oh. my. gosh.  so comfortable!  it\\'s one of the few times i\\'ve ordered something i\\'ve researched that has actually turned out to be everything it was advertised.  i absolutely love how comfortable they feel, how attractive they hang and that they will allow me to get rid of about six other pairs of pants i wear out of desperation rather than love.<br /><br />do yourself a favor and give these a shot.  i\\'m sure they aren\\'t for every woman out there - but i bet they come pretty close.  and if you don\\'t like them ... send them my way! feel great and look hot. love the organic bamboo. can wear for days and don\\'t stretch out!! definitely a great buy excellent my son is 3 years old and very skinny, so the 2t fits him perfectly! super cute & comfy. good quality!!  cozy and  comfy i was looking for a slip for my ten year old daughter. these nylon boxers were the perfect solution.  the size small fit her just right and work perfectly as a slip.  plus, i love the extra modesty she receives because they fit her like shorts.  the price was more than reasonable and i am very happy with the quality and value.  i\\'m back to order another pair! i really love these tights. they are the perfect size for me i am 5\\'2 and weigh 130 pounds. the prints on these tights looks amazing and it doesn\\'t look faded when it stretches. very comfortable and it is real silky and smooth fabric. you will love this. fits great love them. i\\'m 5\\'9&#34;, 110 lbs, ordered size 27, they fit perfectly. i love these pants! the fit is wonderful, and the fabric is just great.  very comfortable product! these are a fine pair of trousers for the price.  i own three pair and wear them regularly for work and leisure.  they hold up well and look fine.    yes, they are polyester for those who have been surprised by that fact, and - yes - they have cuffs.    my only minor issues have dealt with an occasional lack of wrinkle resistance following laundering (a quick touch-up with an iron fixes that) and a tendency to produce static electricity just after laundering (just a quick spray of static-gard solves that).    those two little concerns aside, it\\'s hard to beat such a good pair of trousers at this great price. i got it in both pink and green, both cute. they are only $5 plus free shipping. i highly recommend this outfit, it is cute but yet dressy enough for church and birthday parties. nice i absolutely in love with these leggings!! great material, soft, and the they fit perfectly!!\\' comfyq i waited until the last minute to order these pants for a camouflage party the following weekend......i read all the reviews and took the advice in reference to ordering a size smaller...... i was a bit nervous being it was last minute. ..... but i did and im glad i did...... apparently these pants run really big.....i was gonna get an xl but the large fits fine! !!  so i have to do no return shipping!! i ordered on friday evening and item was in my mailbox on tuesday after work.....quick shipping and good quality product.....who can ask for anything more?  thanks alot!! just what we need! my husband loves these pajama pants. they are comfortable and fit nicely. bought for a halloween costume. they worked fine for me. i don\\'t know if i\\'d use them for yoga as they can be a bit translucent. i like these even though they could be a little bit longer, not exactly like the picture. they are different and they are comfortable. these are a perfect fit for me in a medium size (i\\'m 5\\'3\\\\\\\\\" and 130 lbs) and the length of the pants is nice and long. i have longer legs so i appreciate that about them. these pants do hit the floor prewashed but after the first wash they shrink a bit so that they are the perfect length to wear barefoot or in tennis shoes. highly recommended! i love it it\\'s just too small.  it cost way too much to return for a larger size. love em! i like them but i send in the rouge size. i send them back, comfy and great color. travel great too since you just scrunch them up in your bag. easy to pack, wash i loved the stretch, and the pants fit great. i got the black and navy blue. after 6 weeks and weekly washing, the navy faded, and the pants faded more than the top. the set looks like i\\'ve had it for 2-3 years! black is so far great. may order another color later. these are some of the most comfortable sweat pants i\\'ve ever owned.<br /><br />had to return because they are too large.<br /><br />if you are a large order a medium, the fit will be better or else they are too loose. very cute and comfy. would highly recommend  grow well with baby since they have stretchy material  love this product very much excelente it took about 3 days to come in which was pretty quick. sizes are true and pants look great on! great buy! total came about to 35 with shipping. i gave it a 4 out of 5 because levi joggers are only 35 and are better quality kinda small<br />get a size up love them! received them very fast they fit well i love them good price. good quality really nice cotton and comfortable they are so soft and fit good purchased this at about 20 weeks along and 5 weeks later it still fits.. the secret fit belly panel is very comfortable and not constricting at all, and it is full panel as it goes completely over the belly and right under your bra.it washes well and has kept its shape and size with multiple dryer uses. it is very true to size, so but the size you usually wear, if you like an even looser fit, you can go a size up. great buy and positive that this will see me through my entire pregnancy. reviewed by s.brewster- happy pregnant wife :) love love love these yoga pants! they are so comfortable i could wear them everyday. they also fit nicely and make your tush look perky. i already have two pair in black and want to order some in heather grey as well. very pleased! okay, so i am 5 foor 9 ish and 140 pounds. i have fairly big hips and a larger back area. these fit really nice. the good kind of snug ya know? they are super soft and they arent too tight at the waist. they are a little see through around the butt, but they are white so i didnt expect a perfect solid. they are very very nice! i will definarely buy again love these pants! i\\'m 5\\'7&#34; and they are a perfect length for flats. they are comfy and perfect for a casual look. i\\'ve already ordered another pair! look sexy and comfortable all the time and no too hot like regular jean do in summer time ,love it the fit is great...the pattern is awesome and i highly recommend these to anyone looking for nice workout pants!  i wear them everywhere. it even fit better then what i thought. love it i need ti buy more. there very comfortable to wear great product these are pretty nice, but i need to have them hemmed. i am 5\\'10&#34; and they are an extra 2-3 inches below my heel.<br /><br />pros:<br />comfortable and light weight fabric<br />nice fitting, breathable<br />extra long for tall ladies<br />pretty good price compared to all the others on amazon<br />seemingly good quality fabric<br />thick enough fabric that it doesn\\'t show skin imperfections<br /><br />(too long for me - but i can\\'t really fault them for this, i expected it given the title and other reviews)<br /><br />cons:<br />slightly thinner fabric. not totally see through, but somewhat. amazing.. love them bought these for wife and she loves them. fit perfect. see thru no problem. i purchase these in black and gray for my wife.  she and i both love them.  she likes how they feel.  i love how they accentuate her hips and butt.  the material is durable and has endured many washes.  these are worth the extra dollars. excelente producto, de buena calidad, llego en el tiempo previsto y en buenas condiciones. recomiendo este producto y la marca. these are great pants to lounge around the house in on a lazy sunday watching football or any other time!! super cute. nice fabric. easy to wear. ankles not too tight. perfect fit. i bought them for my wife which was risky but she loved them. love the material!!! these were great! i had to hem them because im short but after i did they fit perfect! the materials just the right thickness. no show -unlike some of these \\\\\\\\\"yoga pants\\\\\\\\\" out there these are my favorite pants. i wear them and wash them constantly and they hold up great! good product and good value. i am filled with american might and power when wearing these fine pants. they allowed me to finally dunk on a regulation hoop, and every 4th of july i am granted the powers of flight and foresight. i wanted to use these instead of pull ups. they work well, just know accidents will happen. my daughter is actually starting a little earlier than some at 18 months. we have had plenty of accidents so far; however, she knows when she is going and that is worth it\\'s weight in gold. after a week we are staring to see some success. you could put a plastic pants on her but i made sure to buy plenty and since we are starting a little early it doesn\\'t bother me to slack off when tensions get high. we are very pleased with them. love how it covers my knees i was looking for inexpensive pants for working out and this does fit that expectation. the quality of the pant is only average, but considering the price of the pants, i wasn\\'t expecting more than i received.  the waist is fairly loose fitting as the material does not have a lot of elasticity to it. i will also add that i do like the length of the pants.  i\\'m only 5\\' 6&#34;, but with fairly long legs and most pants end up around my ankles, but the length fit well.  i have only had about a week so i will update once i have a better feel for how they hold up after several wear / washes. great weight for warmer temps. i was hoping for a little more of a khaki (dress pink) color; these were a little more yellowish. not my favorite, but nice pants none-the-less; and made in italy. pants were awesome for the price.  a little short but i\\'m 5\\'9&#34;, so they are more like ankle length. great for the price!! great fit, love my pants!!! the fabric is super soft and warm, and the light grey color is as depicted.  reviews indicate that the sizing runs very small but the xl was too large and the skirt bunched at the back (5&#34;7&#34; 130lbs).  returned xl for l and will review upon receipt. our daughter practically lives in these pj\\'s on the weekend!  they are soft, maintain their bright colors with repeated washings, and comfy to sleep in. all great and superb quality.  great for small projects or as giveaways. my son was very pleased with the look and i am happy with the quality of the fabric which should last him. i was the crow for halloween... i looked great... i usually wear an xl so the pants fit but i\\'m under 5\\'4\\'and the pants are very long. i\\'m only using them in my home for chair yoga so being long is not a problem. they are very comfortable. love love love it, helping me get my sexy back the comfort level is amazing. these are very lightweight and would be suitable for pajamas or yoga pants. i bought them in extra small for my daughter-in-law (size 0, about 5\\'5&#34;), who is just beginning to show, because i wanted something that would fit now. they are very adjustable, though they may have to go under belly if she gets big. my dil is not petite but they were about 4 inches too long. ok for pj\\'s but she will have to hem them if she wants to use them for yoga. thumbs up overall. actually i bought two of the dance sweats and two dance shirts.  great quality and too cute.  the fit was perfect plus they wash great.  i really am glad i bought these they have been a great addition for my grandaughter who is 7!    plus they are not  like all the others here.  she loves that! love this slack.  wish there were more colors available.  petite fits great although the short is way short so i ordered the average the next time around--just a teeny bit too long. the great prize, the service is excellent. the size s is fit. bought these for my daughter she loves them! i ordered this for winter in madison. it kept me warm and dry while i was running to the gym in the snow. awesome fit and well made!! love these pants daughter loves them! they appeared somewhat small. however they do fit and are very comfortable. people will either love them or hate them there\\'s no in between but i love them!! super comfy & lovely! stretchy waistband for many sizes, thin material, breathable & even great to do yoga in. highly recommend. =) we got this for my son because he was in my sister\\'s wedding at only 2 months old. it fit him great and was very comfortable. in my opinion, this is a much cuter/cheaper option than buying a baby tux that will fit once fit nice just too long my son needed a new pair of sweats for his off season football workouts and he loved this.  he is all about anything air force and will wear it with pride.  he is 5/11 and weighs 190 and the large fit just perfect. great item for quick wear. purchased for a gift ex-girlfriend loved them i have more than 15 pairs of these in my closet and am totally addicted.  years ago i wore these on my 2nd date with my now husband and he said they were the reason he asked me out again.  lol  these shape the female form better than most.  the one problem i have found is the stitching often is not sturdy around the crotch and i have had to take most of mine into get them re-stitched at one time or another.  aside from the that, they last forever even though they do fade a bit. very soft fabric, super comfy but we made the mistake of getting the pant for our son, not a good style for boys, unless your into the look which is fine too, overall it\\'s a great product. i love these. they\\'re so so so comfortable and fitting for work. i move around a lot at work and i\\'m constantly going and these are perfect for that. i bought some work dickies and they were ok but these are much better for me. these also had front and back (the back has buttons which is kind of annoying) which is so nice because i only had back pockets in my dickies. i\\'m short, and these are long but not too long for me to have to hem them which is great. would buy another pair! omg this is absolutely my favorite pants ever! i am a size 12 in usa, bought the pants size xxl and they fit perfect, they are so comfortable that i feel like i could do yoga in them if i wanted. i love the colors, how they look which is sexy and sooooo happy i bought them. these are really cute. the fabric is quite thin, so one may have to wear leggings underneath if they want to wear them when it gets cooler outside. i plan on ordering more harem pants from this brand\\\\company. makes the 2 week shipping time worth it! these are rally nice and seem to keep my warm but i wish i would have ordered a size up. i am 5\\'8 and about 135 pounds. j run track so i have a lot of leg muscle and i didn\\'t out that into consideration when buying these because they are kind if tight. but lengthwise they they are perfect. i gonna buy another one a size bigger i really enjoy this product. they fit great and come in a variety of fun colors. i got a pair in every color! these pants look perfect.  i get lots of complements and they fit so good.  i don\\'t like tightness around the waist and these are perfect.  i got a 34/30 pair and i also bought it in the other 2 colors because i love them.  the material is fantastic! i miss when hot topic used to sell normal tripp pants, not that skinny cut crap. but now i found the normal ones online! these were so very cute. definitely expensive, but worth it since i can\\'t find pants like these anywhere else. very comfortable and loving the straps and extra details everywhere. my newborn loves this set.  soooo soft and comfy yet very breathable.  washes great.  my 2 year old son had multiple pairs as well.  wish i had some:) talk about your trip down memory lane!<br /><br />i rock these pants with some old school reeboks from the thrift shop, and a frankie says relax t-shirt! the jumpsuit looks great and feels great. my favorite outfit this summer. i bought two. i love it and received several compliments. we are in the beginning stages of potty training, these are great for little leaks, but our son is definitely not happy when he full on goes in these, which is good. they also do a good job of holding in solid waste, if your kid is as stubborn as ours and goes to the bathroom immediately after you take him off the potty. he really likes the cars too, and isn\\'t very verbal yet so we are trying &#34;don\\'t pee or poop on the cars&#34; instead of &#34;don\\'t pee or poop in your underwear&#34; which is a pretty complicated phrase to comprehend when your vocabulary consists of kitty, mom, dad and poop. really good. the only thing left undetailed about this item was that it runs in big sizes, but if you think about it, it says unisex, so you can expect for the sizes to be geared towards men.  so if a woman is ordering, maybe a note should be made to remember that the sizes are unisex which means that they are tailored for men to be able to wear and women have to gauge what they would wear in a man\\'s size.  other than that, very descriptive product advertisement. i have gotten many compliments on the way these look. the fit is nice and slightly stretchy, but the sizes do run small. buy one size up in us women\\'s. i bought this pants for me  and i like it , its licensed from general motors , gold small birds and trans am words on it , very cool for musclecars fans ! thanks wore this weekend in a wilderness area and they held up well. will order again as needed to replace this pair. i\\'m very short, so i tend to buy capris to wear as regular pants, and these ones are a perfect fit! they\\'re loose, comfortable, and i can\\'t wait to order 2 more pairs! super fast delivery. great item.  seller called me and corroborate sizes.  fit perfectly. bought for my girlfriend she loves them when i first saw these, i knew i had to have them.  i decided to shop around and found the best price here. lets face it.. $120 for tights is up there... these are not compression tights (think 2xu brand which i also own) but they do have a nice support feel to them. i mainly wear compression to the gym when i lift and wanted something a bit lighter.<br /><br />i am 5ft 2in 125lb and they fit great, except a little long in the legs but not bad.  i just do a little pulling around the knees and ankles to line it up better. i love the fact that there is no cutting in feeling at the waist... no muffin top either.  the mesh on the back looks cool and keeps you cool at the same time. i love the little reflective dots for nighttime visibility too. i know some tights can be see through when bending over but i do not notice that here. happy to find it, stores didn\\'t seem to carry them! these pants are a little big for my grandson but he will grow into them over the next few months. great üòä i love these pants! i want more colours. they drape beautifully and look very elegant. yes, they\\'re kind of long for us shorter gals, but i\\'ll be wearing heels with them anyway. i was looking for a part of &#34;bdu-style&#34; pants to wear outdoors and to throw into a bug-out bag if needed. these pants appear to be durable and well made. i haven\\'t tested the flame-resistance of the pants, although they\\'re not a big issue for me. they seem to breathe reasonably well and shed light rain and moisture. make sure you order your pants in the appropriate length...i ordered a pair of regular length first and they were much too long (i\\'m only 5\\' 8&#34; with a short inseam). downsides are that the fly is 4-buttons and the pockets are velcro - it\\'d be nice if they had a zipper fly and button pockets. other than that, they do the job. came two days earlier than expected. looks great. bought then as a gift for my sister, she loves them! these pants are fine and they seem to fit my wife well.  she likes them and the material is good for the price. lightweight jersey fabric, perfect for cool spring and fall evenings.  since it was men\\'s size, and i\\'m only 5\\'5&#34;, the legs were really long, but the fabric can be cut to the proper length without unraveling, so no need to hem the cuffs.  super cozy, i love them! this is very stylist, cute, and comfortable. my only complaint was around the threading coming aloose at the top of it; not made extremely well, but ok for the price. very warm, comfy, overall a great buy if you need good sweatpants. legs are to long for size these black and white oversized polka dot fleece pj pants are so fun to wear and so comfortable!  i normally wear a women size 6 and choose to go with a size large in these since they are juniors size.  a large works well for comfy fit but a medium may have been more flattering - either way such a great deal and super cute.  the dots are a fun and large; silver dollar sized.  husband even commented that he likes them.  bonus! i originally got these slacks just for school (massage school) which has to have a lot of movement and still look professional and withstand the occasional oil encounter.  but they are so comfortable, look so good that i find myself reaching for them to go to work (doctor\\'s office), going shopping, and anytime i might be traveling and want total comfort.  i got all the colors they offered and am not one bit disappointed in any of them.  they are a great product. there is no support around the waist and it\\'s way too loose. had to make adjustments to keep the pants from falling off. otherwise ok. the material is soft and flowing, very comfortable to wear and in the summer  the pants are cool. i followed the thanth sizing chart (height and weight) and got a large.  i usually wear a medium and feel that is what i should have gotten this time also. this fits but if it stretches at all it will be too big. so cute soooo cute product fits fine just what i expected. love it... got it b4 i was suppoes to... great price and great shipping... i look forward to ordering from them again... i love them so much? they look great and fit comfortably. there is no waist band and it makes the pants slowly slide down. they are so comfortable and i would know cuz i blessed with junk in my trunk and the fit perfectly and i get a lot of compliments on them that i bought another pair, i got the xl because of my buttocks. the price is great and they came at the estimated time of delivery. excellent product and seller i recommend both! item delivered on schedule, in good packaging, fits great! thanks! lovely item!  the material is silky, lightweight but sheer.  not sheer enough to cause a wardrobe malfunction but do consider discrete (nude colored) undergarments.  i\\'m ordering this garment in black as well! extremely comfy wore then after having surgery on my stomach. wash well and keeps color. wish i could have them in all the colors. the savior for me after surgery my son just used pull-ups like diapers and was not having potty success, he was almost 3. my mother told me how she used training pants w/ rubber pants over them to potty train us. i could not find them in stores but did here. 3 days after switching to these with the rubber pants he was potty-trained completely. after two weeks with no accidents we stopped using them and he was able to get \\\\\\\\\"big boy\\\\\\\\\" underwear at target. he has now been potty-trained for 3 months. perfect for all of my skirts i love these pants! i can where these work as s type of slacks, or i can use them as actual yoga/zumba pants. they are comfortable all around and you can not tell the difference between slacks and these (and these were cheaper and more comfortable!!) :) because i should have gotten a size smaller, a little more elastic in the waistband would have been welcome, but i can cinch them up with the included ribbon tie.  very nice fleece lounge pants. nice comfortable pants. ordered a size up and rocked this at a music festival. got a lot of compliments! best pants in the history of pants. honestly, who wants to take a roundhouse kick to the face while i\\'m wearing these bad boys? absolutely adore these! love these, a little sheer but fit wonderfully.  will order a few more. i wore this dress to my cousins wedding. i loved it and i was given many compliments on it. i\\'m 5\\'1 and 105, with a 34c bust and somewhat curvy hips. i ordered a small. it fit very well, i wasn\\'t suffocating in it.<br /><br />but my only issue was that it was tight to get the waist past my hips (specifically where the zipper ended) every time i would have to take the romper on and off; when i was to trying it on and taking it off and very annoying every time i would use the restroom-&#62;&#62;&#62; which then at the bottom end of the zipper, the threads to broke and the seams loosened and left a hole in that part of the romper(which was not noticeable when wearing it.<br /><br />i\\'ve added photos showing what the zipper looks like when relaxed, with the fabric spread to show the hole, and with my index finger through the hole. awsome pants these are exactly what i wanted. they aren\\'t see through the way some cheap ones are. you can\\'t beat the price at $13 either. i would totally buy these again. totally not my style but thought it would be good for my teenager.  i was apparently correct!  price is appropriate for what you get. i have long legs, so i am always looking to make sure the length is going to be long enough. there is plenty of length in these pants, and for shorter people they can be easily hemmed, as there is not existing hem. i love the folder over waist and the material is super soft. i bought these for traveling and lounging about, but i can see them looking super cute with sandals and a top almost anywhere. the shipping was very fast and when i contacted the seller to ask a question, they responded very fast! i love these pants. super comfy and breezy perfect for a beach bonfire or really anywhere. i will be buying more in assorted colors. no complaints just heads up they run small in waist and hips and are sheer but have great length and pretty colot these pull on pants are very comfy; the material is light enough to wear even on the most humid days.  they were about two inches two long, but measuring carefully and cutting them to fit was no problem.  the material kept a sharp edge with no unraveling after laundering.  i washed them in warm (oops!) water on the delicate cycle with no issues.  a great find that can be paired with any length shirt; dress them up or not; they are just fun to wear! i have a newborn nephew and i wanted to send him something different. this outfit was just what i was looking for. cute pockets on the pants and 2 matching adorable bodysuits ... very happy.  thank you. first time buying to early to tell but seem great a little long i by these in every color. they are a bit tight, but in a good way(they hold ur s*** in), and for the price its totally worth it.  they tend to break in the crotch easy, but a quick sew job and they are good for another month or so. they last about 3 to 6 months. well worth the price. these pants were purchased for an elderly person. they are comfortable and wear well. worked great for snowboarding, i was warm and dry all day. they dry really fast i went on a three day trip and after hanging them up the night before they where dry the next morning. incredibly comfortable. i\\'d love to buy more. love love love these the fabric is wonderful & made very well. the waste is curved to fit . i needed them in a hurry so had to find another pair elsewhere but i may reorder. comfy i liked the pants!  i always need pants just a .5 size smaller but i am used to wearing belts.  they pants are comfortable and wash up very nice.  they have not required pressing.  length is just right.  i would recommend them to anyone! great look and fit...very comfortable.  well made. i love this product is very comfortable and most important i wear them at work ;) i hate trying on pants, mainly because i can very rarely find ones that fit me like i want. these pants are amazing! very quick turnaround between ordering and receiving them as well. i would definitely buy from this seller again. really love the material and the fit.  will wear them to casual parties.  almost any color top will go with this print.  they are even the right length to wear with flats or fairly low heels. slightly small but not a problem!!! these are fun, flowy and fabulous for summer;) i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; sz 8-10....and ordered the medium. fit is slightly snug but the pattern is quite forgiving! these are great pants, seems heavy duty enough and the construction is good. the sizing runs small though, so order up a size if you can. i am an 8/10 us which i think is the max size for these. i would say i barely comfortably can wear them. fit perfectly ! i would purchase wallflower jeans again, these pants are very comfortable and has super stretch . the price was reasonable. everyone was asking where did she get these cute joggers. the pants and color  are really nice ,the feel is very soft. now the fit was a little big on me. i ordered a xl because reviews said it runs small.the material was very stretchy. i normally wear a size 7 in jr or a size 4 in women .i\\'m going to keep them and wear them when with along shirt so you can\\'t tell there a little big.i went back and purchase a and purchase in a diffent color in a size large. i\\'m hoping these fit me better. i would recommend them .i don\\'t think they run small though. i love the leggings but the color is quite a bit lighter than show in picture.  they are great though! i love these! they aren\\'t a massive 7, the fabric is stretchy and they\\'re perfect for casual work pants.  pockets are a little small but go figure--they\\'re women\\'s pants. looked really tiny for my 5.10inch , 178pd frame but were really comfy and long.  took a bit of getting into the first time (being skinny jeggings). but after that - my go-to pant! these pants are super comfotable and they keep you warm when you go outside into the cold. the size is great on me ( i wear a 8/9), but they were able to strech to fit my friend. love these pants so much good looking and fit just right i have been running in them since i got them. i love them! great fit, simple design, very happy! fast delivery!!! awesome!!! love burt\\'s bees! i love these leggings, they look like snug jeans and the material is very nice. anatomically accurate, very light and comfortable, breathable, fashionable, etc. i would definitely recommend this (n2n products tend to be very nice in general, actually...). ok fits perfect no problems i bought these pants to wear when i use the snowblower. your pants always get soaked when the snow blows back into your face. these should eliminate that problem. i haven\\'t used them in the snow yet, but they slide over your jeans with ease. the zipper leg bottom is great to get over your boots. they do not feel bulky at all. these do run a little large, but not so much that you need a smaller size than your normal size pants. it will be nice to come back into the house, with a clear driveway, and not have change into dry jeans. best outfit i have received from amazon. perfect outfit. fits great. and i wrore it in public. everyone stared at me. either they think i know marital arts or i was just weird. but its beautiful. and the pants are awesome.. thanks guys! gift for my son and he loves it. got 3 pairs a size up and they fit him fine. so soft and comfortable!! i bought a pair of these pants in the motherhood maternity store and they are so comfortable.  i bought a 1x petite and they are perfect for work.  i have a strict dress code and have to wear khaki pants so these were my only real option.  the store only had 1 pair in stock but they ordered me a pair to get shipped to my house for free!  the women at the store were so helpful and not pushy at all.  i am planning on ordering more for work so i don\\'t have to do laundry every day. getting into harem pants, may be my new style! i adore tigers, so i picked these as my first purchase. harem pants look so baggy and comfy, and have such a cute style. i just got them in the mail minutes ago, tried them on, and fell in love. they are just as comfy as they look, and so stylish! i love my clothing to be flowy and non-constricting (no tight jeans for this girl) and these are just perfect! the fabric is so soft and airy, but not see-through. i\\'m a little worried about the tiger print and shrinking, so will wash these inside out in cold water, and hang to dry. i\\'m 5\\'3, and thought myself to be a little shorter than the models and so thought the pants would reach down to my ankles; however, they reach down a couple/few inches from my ankles, but are not capri length. i wish they did reach all the way down, but just as in the photo, they do not. it\\'s alright, though, i still love them! anyone taller than that, be aware of that fact. these have a very stretchy waistband, so no worries for fit. the waist band is about 7 inches high, so i can wear them a little low to cover more leg.<br />i am very pleased with these pants, they seem to be very well made, and the tiger print is just lovely. i can\\'t wait to try their other cute harem pants! excellent i got these in the mail yesterday and i was so in love the minute i took them out of the package. they are a perfect fit. they fit me so perfectly i was actually amazed. they are a bit see through but i think its just because they are white, you cant even really see anything through them just a slight tinge of skin color. i love them so much! my daughter loves her joggers! they were delivered really fast, was not expecting them this quick. i would definitely order again! these are training pants, so the crotch is thicker than normal kids underwear. they are just meant to catch most of whatever your child is doing so there isn\\'t a big puddle on the floor. they are meant to feel wet and gross so your child quits going in their pants and uses the bathroom instead. messy process, but raising children isn\\'t clean or easy. worked for me and my siblings and now has worked for my son. i know the cost seems high, but compared to pull-ups they are well worth it. i bought size 3t and although my son was trained when he was 2, he is now 4 and these still fit him so he wears them in winter. they have survived many washings brilliantly. i love these pants, so soft, and comfortable.  i will be buying a few more pair soon.  the pack easy, travel well, and are so easy to clean.  i love them. these pants are great. even thought they run large you can roll them up to fit baby until they did fit. all the colors are great and they are very soft. i had lots of onesie tops but few bottoms. i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; and 145 lb, and the size medium fits great.  i wear them around the house and to the gym.  would definitely recommend these to a friend. good quality and feel, size is accurate. bought as gift for x-mas, i know he will love it ! i absolutely adore these pants! i get a lot of compliments.<br />they\\'re soft, and the pattern is adorable. it\\'s great to be able to wear something unique with a t-shirt and pumps. they make any outfit look nice. i usually wear a size 3 pants but these have an elastic waist so i could see someone who wheres a couple sizes larger fit into these with room to spare.<br /><br />i love these pants, just the thing that bothers me is that the eyes are printed on, not a part of the fabric. i just worry about them coming off, but so far they\\'ve held up great. just take care when washing them.<br /><br />all in all, so happy i got them. would recommend them to anyone with a love of unique clothing. work as advertised. i have worn them 4 or 5 times now. i have stayed dry each and every time. love the shorts ordered saturday and i got them wensday good fit as well my favorite pants. i will buy another pair for sure! may be a different color... i bought the black one - looks grait as on the picture i was a \\\\\\\\\"working man\\\\\\\\\" since age 17, so i learned to appreciate good clothes. dickies were always good, sturdy pants. now that i am retired, i am less working and more \\\\\\\\\"loafing\\\\\\\\\", but they are still my choice for good pants. if you buy a few new ones instead of keeping those old \\\\\\\\\"ratty\\\\\\\\\" ones (you know what i mean), they look good enough to wear almost everywhere every day. and because you are not grinding them up working, they will probably still be good when they are closing the lid over you! &lt;grin> also, i saved a few bucks by getting these from this supplier. good going everyone! one note: even though it says \\\\\\\\\"navy\\\\\\\\\", these pants are blue... dark blue, but blue. so if you think blue pants are weird, get another color. i like them, and don\\'t think they are too blue. i am giving these 5 stars because they are adorable and simply the softest thing i have ever felt. i also bought the matching kimono onesie to go with it, and now i want it in all sizes and colors. i have not washed it yet, and it is a thin fabric, so i\\'m not sure how it will hold up. i always wash things like this on a delicate cycle in my agitator-free machine and hang to dry, just in case. i bought these as a gift for my fiance and he absolutely loved them. i am glad i read some of the other reviews and got one size up than what i thought i needed. if i hadn\\'t done that i think they would have been a little short but they are perfect! after reading other reviews i ordered a size larger and they fit good. the fabric is a little rough and the stitching isn\\'t holding up as well as the carhart pants i have but they are half the price, i would order another pair she loves them!  fast shipping bought these for my girlfriend for a country outfit. she loves them and looks great in them! just beautiful! !! love the peacock design!! these leggings sure get you sweating. i am very happy with the product and i could say they are as advertised. the only problem is they are larger then what i expected. i wear a size 12 and i got a large which should be a 10-12 and it too large. i am going to have to buy a smaller size when i get some extra cash. i still where the large size because they make me sweat but they are not snug. great product buy it today.... as expected.beautiful. my friend loved the outfits these are a little more fitted around and above the knee than i expected, but still a nice pant for workouts. i ordered my regular size and one size up and the size up are more comfortable. i\\'d suggest a size up if you want a little more room and plan to dry on a regular heat dryer setting. the longer length covers the top of my walking shoes so i don\\'t feel like i\\'m wearing pants that are too short. i am average height and when i wear athletic shoes with a regular length pant from other brands, they are a bit short for my preference to wear with a (higher height) athletic shoes. the length of these pants remedy that issue. kickypants has the softest fabric made of bamboo.  this hat is so soft and is tag free.  i love it, i\\'m sure baby won\\'t know she has it on. only reason 4 not 5 is the length is 2 or 3&#34; too short. i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; and the ankles ride up to mid calf while walking (wearing them as pants)... haven\\'t worn as a jump suit but i have worn 3 times as pants. nice and baggy to almost the knee. wash great too. haven\\'t shrunk or changed color. great summer pants! very nice - waist - length - overall fit perfect -shipped on time - qverall quality is excellent mad pussy in deez pants i bought two of these, and i love them both.  i hope these stay in stock for a long time, since i know i will repurchase.<br /><br />they fit perfectly (i am 5\\'4 and pretty petite).  these are super flattering, too.  some pants can slightly baggy, and others can flatten my butt too much. these do neither - they just flatter my shape and i love it.  i would definitely recommend, especially if you\\'re tired of purchasing overpriced yoga pants. i love these. i always search amazon for the least expensive color since i want enough to keep him in at night despite diaper leaks. would give five stars except they aren\\'t organic. bought these mesmerize mariel black front slit pants at a boutique on cape cod.  these are amazing pants.  they fit perfectly and the fabric is very high quality.  looking for more colors. a brother-in-law gave me a pair of these probably twenty years ago as a gag.    well, the joke is on him, i\\'m now on my second pair, and now both my teen-age boys and wife have pairs.  come to think of it, maybe this pair i\\'m reviewing is the one i sent to my brother-in-law last christmas.    comfortable and well-built, you will impress your friends, and dazzle your opponents with your sartorial splendor (look it up.)  women will want to take care of you, and men will want to know where you found them... what more can i say???    those weight lifters from the 1980\\'s were on to something, and now you don\\'t have to be ordering new old stock off of ebay to get your nether parts into this high fashion.    i\\'m skinny (32\\\\\\\\\" waist), and although they are baggy, i can play soccer in them on cold days.  they come off without me having to take the soccer cleats off, once i\\'m warmed up, as the cuffs stretch. fits great, and as others have said, is a little long, but can be hemmed. (better than too short, for sure.) super comfy and what a great price at $2.50. i didn\\'t expect much, but these are fantastic. highly recommend. i wear alfred dunner most of the time; i know my size therefore everything i buy fits as expected. i\\'m really happy with these pants! they fit nicely which i was worried about because i have wider hips. they are super comfortable and  i love them! the pants were very comfortable, but they fit a little small and were a little shorter than i expected. i were a size 6-8. i ordered a large according to the size chart that was posted with the pants and i am glad that i did. love them, great comfortable fit these pants are a more affordable alternative to the bamboo yoga brand i usually buy (green apple yoga pants).  they run very large compared to most yoga pants i have purchased (victoria\\'s secret, ck, nike, green apple etc.)  i would get one size smaller than your usual size if you like a loose fitting yoga pant and 2 sizes smaller if you want a tighter fit.<br /><br />i would wear these to the gym to work out or wear in a yoga class.  i don\\'t think i would run to the store in them like i would with my green apple pants.  these look a bit more like pajama pants because of the baggy style. really nice quality. soft and comfortable.  great extra room for diapered toddlers, who are learning to walk. i highly recommend this product. we bought a set of these for our then 2.5 year old about six months ago, and she received a couple of other (big name) brands as christmas gifts about that same time.  all three brands were in size 2t.  these ones fit fairly well from day 1, while the others were a bit big at the waist and legs.  lo and behold, six months later, the luvable friends panties still fit comfortably, while both of the other brands are very tight and leave red marks on her legs.  (she is still wearing mostly 2t in pants and skirts.)  the other brands don\\'t have any give in the fabric casing the elastic and never did fit her properly.  my daughter always chooses these panties to wear when she gets a choice.  (my favourite training pants are a pair we were given that have a waterproof outer layer, but they are considerably more expensive than the cotton variety.)  for this type of toddler underwear, the luvable friends are hard to beat.  i plan to buy more in the next size up. these pants are super super comfy. i got the large and they fit just perfect. not super baggy, but still room to move around. really soft, and the band around the waist is great! i purchased this particular product because my daughter is quite small for her age, and i had difficulty finding \\\\\\\\\"big girl underpants\\\\\\\\\" small enough.  these training pants have more padding and absorption than most cloth training pants.  they fit great, and my daughter loves them.  since she has always been prone to diaper rash, these cloth training pants have worked better than disposables.  accidents wash out easily and haven\\'t stained (thanks to shout).  i recommend them! my 2.5 year old fits well into the 3t size.  they are easy for him to pull up and down and offer a little style variety since the only other training pants i\\'ve been able to find are gerber and carters.  good for the price. great look for little boys or girls who like to play army.  we ordered name patches & sargent stripes for our grandsons & they are very happy. they fit well and they feel like they will last a long time.  the color was exactly like the picture and there is a good variety of colors. i bought these to go under my skirts and dresses. these are perfect. they\\'re very comfortable and soft. me love it hahaha these are good quality pants and comfortable, shipped very quickly.    at first i thought they were pricey, but pricing out materials and labor comes to the same cost.    as for sizing, the large is plenty big enough for my 40\\\\\\\\\" waist, 32\\\\\\\\\" inseam. the xl are slightly longer, but the waist is huge. i ordered these in my eighth month of pregnancy. they are very comfy and a nice fit. i\\'m a big size 14 and these fit great. i wear these whenever i\\'m home. i love these pants. i got a different type and then found these, got them, and immediately got a second color. the color is nice. i was happily surprised by the pockets. i haven\\'t worn them much in the jumper mode, but the pants are incredibly comfortable. my son is 21.5 lbs (not sure on the length) and i bought the 9-12 month size. it fits perfectly now, he\\'ll probably outgrow it in a month or so. i\\'ve washed it twice so far.  the pattern is so adorable, i highly recommend. fits great! exactly what i was looking for. great fit and i ordered a few more. i\\'m 5.2 and wear a size 4 (but between a 2 and a 4) fit perfect. these leggings are so cute, so comfy, and so warm!  i love them! i ordered two pair in the charcoal grey in the size and they fit great!  i usually wear a small or medium...depending on the leggings.  i like being able to wear comfortable leggings that have the extra built-in coverage of the skirt so i don\\'t have to wear a longer top or layer another underneath.  these are genius!  thinking about ordering two more pair... ok first they arrived super fast!!!!! i was late for work i couldn\\'t take them off when i tried them on!!! i normally wear 9-10 so i ordered a size 13 perfect fit not sure if they will stretch after all day! but i love them thank you great pirate pants.  i wear a medium so i ordered a s/m and they fit; a little tight, however, they do fit fine.  i\\'m a size 34 waist.  shipped fast also: i ordered tuesday morning and they arrived friday.<br /><br />i\\'m not sure how the large would fit me ( 34 ) but if i were doing a lot of physical activity (which i\\'m not) i may have chose a size large. they arrived earlier than expected. these pants are absolutely my favorite and so comfortable!  they look flattering and are the perfect length.  i plan on buying more. these pants are comfy but they shrink! i mean after every wash omg they go smaller & smaller wtf!? do not buy or waste your money the material is all wrong for these pants so if you bought them already and they are in transit send them back guys!!! trust me on this! urrrrgh!!! great soft quality and super fast delivery! like the price. fast delivery. these are great.  absorbent enough to prevent puddles, but not so much that my toddler couldn\\'t understand that he was wet. i ordered these pants for my sister during her pregnancy because she was barely fitting in her clothes. she loves them and they fit perfect. i would definitely recommend these for those during pregnancy and they arrived on time. i live in northern michigan and we have very cold long winters.  so i know good snow pants.<br />i couldn\\'t be more pleased. they are just so warm. these footie suits are very soft, and they are lightweight, almost like baby silk longjohns, which make them excellent for layering under other clothes in cold weather. i think they are too thin to really work as an outer garment. but under other clothes, they work beautifully, and you don\\'t have to worry about gaps or lost socks. the 3-6 mo is still slightly big on my 4-month-old daughter who weighs about 12-13 lbs. cheap and fits funny. wife won\\'t wear them good pants, fit well these pants came up when i ran a search for boys pajama pants, so i thought they were boys.  i obviously see the word mens in the title now though.  they are very comfortable though.  he still wears them to sleep in because it doesn\\'t really matter how long the legs are when he\\'s asleep.  there is nothing wrong with the product.  i just wish they wouldn\\'t show up as an option when i searched for boys sleep pants. 6\\'2&#34; 190lb, fits perfectly. the waistband stretches so it could fit bigger or smaller at the waist, the length is perfect. extremely comfortable, awesome to lounge, workout, or just look like a badass in. nice roomy pants perfect for my upcoming trip to key west!  the colors are fantastic and they are so comfortable it\\'s like wearing jammies.  love them! nice thick material, great for winter. two side pockets. yes, that\\'s two side pockets! i wish i\\'d ordered several more while they had my size in stock. the only negative is the little red polo players all over the pants. that\\'s ralph lauren\\'s logo. gag me with a used roto-rooter. if anyone notices, i\\'ll swear that they\\'re saint george on his charger, about to smack a dragon with a long handled mace. that\\'s my story and i\\'m sticking to it. didn\\'t like the fact that pullups wick away moisture like diapers, thereby defeating the training. got these help in that department and our child knows when something \\\\\\\\\"doesn\\'t feel right\\\\\\\\\". they do run big and bulky. they are designed such that there is no distinct front or back, which i don\\'t agree with since underwear has a distinct front and back. while they absorb well, fluids can leak onto the outer fabric and wet the shorts or pants. what a pleasant surprise!!!  these are so flattering and comfortable (at first the waist did not appear to be possible for most of us--not)!  easily matched with tops i already own and i can wear it under tops for work and change tops when i get to my dance class!  very worth the investment.  hope they are made in black too, i would purchase again. very cute product, fits true to size, very comfortable, great for your teens who are obsessed with mustache items, great price. perfect bruh i love these light wt and supper comfortable lounge around the house or work out pants. love these, sure they\\'re baggy, but they won\\'t eat your balls like most pants. kickee pants are the best! the nicest material possible. soft, stretchy, comfortable. and i love the ruffles on these, the ruffles are the cutest thing on the baby butt! for my daughter and she loves it the most comfortable pants for lounge or going out to dinner! the length is perfect and not too long as so many others i\\'ve tried. love them! nice heavy duty pants, just like i had in the army. comfy but i found the fold over waist to be quite annoying. would buy a similar product but without the fold over waistband. love these pants. they\\'re a nice addition to my wardrobe. they fit a little longer than i expected.  but i love the quality. these are without a doubt the finest pants i have ever seen for sale at any haberdashery. why, when i put them on, i feel spry as a whistle! as a senior partner in the law firm of schmotzen and toobs, i have to impress my clients; make them see that we\\'re the wealthiest firm in new york and they better know it. when i wear my zubaz pants, i don\\'t even need to say a thing. people know you that you who wear zubaz pants are a man of distinction, one who appreciates the finer things in life. now, i have an entire closet full and i couldn\\'t be happier. this product came in a envelope wrapped in plastic. my first impression of the product was wow this is going to be so comfortable and love the hole look in the sides. next was trying them on. this did not go very well. lol. i ordered the biggest size and couldnt get them up over my hips. they are to small but not by a whole lot. i did go back and look at the original order of the product and realized that is was not in american standard sizing. so, i can not give a good or bad review, just that i do love the look and feel of the capri, and i look absolutely forward to continuing my weight loss journey and having these as a target to be worn. thanks great fit look great excellent my daughter wares these for work and for her college courses.  the pants seem to run a bit big, but my daughter is small statue,  so take that for what its worth. the pants are of good material, they ware well. my daughter loves these.  came just in time for some wintery cold weather.  these are very comfortable,  high quality, and warm.  dressy enough to wear to work.. my sister loves these. the sweatpants are good quality. we\\'ve had minor difficulty with sizing. we\\'ve bough these same pants before which fit fine. this time around they fit larger. don\\'t understand. bought this for my daughter for christmas.  she is very tall and thin.  the waist may be a little large, but the length is fine.  made of cotton, so i expect they will shrink some in the wash.  colors are lovely and she was very happy with these pj pants. i bought these for a halloween costume. they fit slightly large so if your in 2 minds go with the smaller. they\\'re not anatomically correct as there was 2 tail bones on the large, maybe the small is different. nobody looked hard enough to notice the dual tail bones so they served their purpose. aside from my skinny man legs people liked the tights. these fit as i expected....fine but too long.  of course, that\\'s the way it goes for 5\\' tall people !  they are soft and not too heavy though and will be nice to wear. looks great from previous review, i expected the fabric to be heavier. however, they are the same thickness as any other scrub. yes, they do run very big in the hip and thigh area with a draw string no elastic waist. however, that may be beneficial to some. the color stays after several washes. it\\'s a unisex scrub. i would recommed this to someone that is fuller in the hip and thigh area. or try a size smaller than what you would wear. beautiful. these are okay.  my biggest issue is that they are a bit too low in the waist.  otherwise, i like the length and the overall fit. large was still a bit snug, but then again i work out so i have a big buttüòéüí™ i think this out fit is not true to size but of course i lost too much weight and rather send the two i bought i will alter myself. the pants are beautiful and flow when you walk. the top fits good. i just need to alter the top. other than that i give it a 5 star. i love this little shirt. it\\'s the perfect size for a newborn and it\\'s so so soft.i needed a little shirt to leave room for the belly button healing. all the little onesies are cute, but i needed something to put on her immediately. this is perfect. slims my waist and hips, looks great with sweaters. i love love love this item, i think i will purchase another one in a different color. great buy!!! i bought another one! i want all of the colors!! fits perfectly. i am size 3 and 5\\'3\\\\\\\\\". i loved the fit, design on the sides and the bottom. but it\\'s a little high waist for me. great for the price thank u i love, bought  two in size12 (i wear small to medium in eileen fisher)  they are a tad short but fine with flats, i am 5\\'8&#34; i pressed them to get out the folds from packing hand crinkled them mildly and off to work.  i just sent for the same pants with straight leg..fingers crossed! this pants are incredibly flattering, really opaque and perfect for working out. they also seem very durable and resistant. awesome buy! very soft material. i liked the pants. it was a hard color to find (green). they were easy for me to shorten since i am under 5 foot. they are comfrotable and warm and easy to wash and dry and iron. fit awsome really surprised at how much i liked these. was not expecting them to be that nice to wear. these are super soft after you wash them once. my daughter loves the cupcakes. they soak up a little pee but not a full pee, which is exactly what you want when training. i\\'ve used them for two kids so far. i\\'ve also spent loads of money on special potty training pants but in the end these are the best, most economical and most comfortable. i ordered these pants a week ago and they came right on time. they\\'re super comfy and exactly what i was hoping for. be careful when choosing a size, i think some colors run different. the gray ones were perfect, but, i think the black ones run a little small.  :)  i hope that was helpful. great. that it thats all.  i feel better when i have something new, on me.  the spring is welcome, sunny. my right leg is pretty gnarly, on account of the accident a few years back, so a guy like me\\'s gotta find the right set of pants for the summer months. these stars and stripes pants fit the bill. they fit well, breathe during the summer. and are roomy enough for a good double set of lunges and jumping jacks without aggravatin\\' the boys. i will say that roundhouse kicks are not any easier in these than in normal pants, but oh well, they look frickin\\' awesome. i bought 7 pairs and never looked back. a must for any ravenclaw. fits well love it i am 5\\'7\\\\\\\\\" and 115.based on other reviews i ordered the xxl. it was the right thing. the waist fits perfectly however the legs are short but i can still wear them with longer socks. true, the knees bag. actually the legs are way big overall but they are super comfortable. i will enjoy wearing them around the house and i will wear them out if i don\\'t care what look like. they would look much better if the legs were form fitting.  update. i don\\'t know how to do an update so i will write it here. these are really very cheaply made. i am not sure they are worth the money although the rest of my review still holds true. i wish i was a little bit taller...they are very long and a have a bell bottom, not a slight flareleg, and if i didn\\'t have a 29&#34; inseam, they would have been perfect. love \\'em, but too large bought them for my daughter and she loves them! it\\'s nice but not as the picture these pants are slightly fitted to be loose but not bag-like. comfortable but sturdy fabric. i wash them on hot and they did not shrink a ton. a good value. scooby dooby doo !!!!!! they are pretty decent for the price, i usually have hard time finding comfy pants for my quads or some that allows me to squat without worrying it will get ripped off lol but those are actually fitable, not a thick material but also not completely see through. (that\\'s my third time ordering those pants, have them in three colors now) do not look like the picture other than that thy fits good i just lost 130 lbs! i did not know if the size would work for me, but it does. i wear them for my exercise classes. they are really comfortable. i do wish they came in petite sizes, though. fits well. not too short for 5ft 6&#34; i love these scrubs. they fit nicely and look nice too. they wash beautifully! these capris are extremely comfortable and well made.  the fit was perfect and were cool to wear with a longer blouse.  i really enjoy the way they are made and would highly recommend them. just what my husband needed to work in the yard in. like the fit, quality, and these are well made, comfortable, i just ordered another pair. arrived in time. packed right and the material is the already soft kind that is perfect for sleeping in. would order again! thanks @twilightjen a little bit of extra tailoring makes these cargo pants a cut above the rest.  they have a slight gather just above the knee that takes some of the bagginess out of the leg where it bends.  it\\'s subtle but it makes for a distinctly nicer fit.  it\\'s a handsome look, very military.  the pants are comfortable and move well with your body.  the construction is high quality.  there\\'s nice detail work around the pockets, which are quite complex.  the extra gathers and pleats allow them to expand but without being excessively pouchy when there\\'s nothing in them.  they\\'re very functional.  the fabric is lightweight yet sturdy and the available colors very appealing -- rich and earthy.  i\\'ve never felt compelled to write a review of any article of clothing, much less a pair of pants, but these are so good that i\\'m inspired to do so. awesome!! (: fast shipping! leggings are great! stretchy & super soft! my new favorite leggings! absolutely love & suggest to buy! daughter loves them i love them... this was a genuine patrick hat. it covers my head and gets me chicks on a regular basis. even won a beer pong tournament with it. nice loose fit very comfortable and the non slip waistband works great to keep uniform shirt tucked in also the handy adjustable pant leg hem is easy to stop dragging the pants fits very well. however, they arrived in the boot cut and i was expecting a more tapered fit at the ankle. i kept them anyway and wore them with my boots which worked very well, they cannot be worn with flats. they were narrow in the thighs and flared at the ankle. next time i will make sure, if i really want the tapered ankle fit, to pay more attention to the description. the picture shown of  these pants are not what i received. maybe a side view picture on the site would have helped with the description of these pants. love these so much!!!! if you are looking for a pair of camouflage army pants stop and pick up a pair of these they are durable and very comfy. \\\\\\\\\"awesome!!!\\\\\\\\\" the material is nice and stretchy as well as comfortable! nice quality fabric, very flattering! i love kicky pants. i have been lucky to find sales over the years and my kids have about half of their wardrobes covered with these soft, high-quality, adorable clothes. i think these polos are my favorite item. the fit is great: fitted but not too tight, and the collars look just right and are so soft they won\\'t bother even the most sensitive necks. these shirts look adorable on boys and girls for a casual-but-clean look. yes they are made in china, but i like to think this is because this is where they\\'re getting the bamboo from ... these are the cutest capris!  the material is very light and summery, perfect for those hot summer days or nights bought these a few days ago and the first thing i noticed was the quality.  these are easily the highest quality pants i own.  just about everything is well though out about these pants.  my only gripe is that the double front packets tend to bulge out and that i have pants that are more comfortable.  overall i am happy with the pants and will likely buy more in future. size, colour & quality was as expected i am normally a med but ordered a xl... it fits perfect!! exactly what i wanted. the are warm and comfy. do what they should do these are light weight, very comfortable, and they fit! i was a bit concerned as others have said they were cut for a smaller figure.  the only improvement would be a pocket on the leg for the phone we have to carry at work. fun pants that can either be worn with the tiger in the front or the back. i was over six months pregnant when i ordered and wore these harem pants and they\\'re elastic and forgiving enough to still feel comfortable and stylish. my co-workers got a kick of the print. some thought i was wearing shorts or a skirt with some tight leggings because of the bagginess of the crotch. it\\'s exactly what i wanted. just wish that it had pockets. but that\\'s an extra luxury, not that necessary. great fit. i\\'m short and it\\'s really hard to find anything that fits well. this is a number one! so soft and comfortable!<br />definitely will recommend! i had purchased a pair in a store several years ago. when i wanted to order one on line i did not know exactly what to call it so as to be able to hunt. finally, i stumbled on these. i had to return these pants because they were way, way too long (i\\'m 5\\'3&#34;). they still deserve a good rating though because the quality was there. if you are tall, or don\\'t mind hemming pants, these would be a good buy. they are adorable.  its a gift for grandchild due to november  2015  shipped these out to daughter  in texas  the other day. fit is great and i love the roll over waste although i love not rolling the waist also. i lived in these pants at work for most of my pregnancy. who wants to wrestle with tights or razors to wear skirts?! these black pants went with every cute maternity shirt i had, and helped me feel presentable at the office. i hate to stop wearing them now (postpartum) because they were so comfy! i love the way the material feels, very comfy. loved the way the fit. they stretch a lot. tight in the legs, but a little too loose at the top. they start to sag throughout the day, but not enough to stop me from wearing them! i hadn\\'t expected the color to be quite so bright, but with a description of &#34;neon orange,&#34; that\\'s on me!  ;) (they are definitely more neon than the image, though.)the pants are a snug, comfy fit that couldn\\'t be better! the fabric is thinner than i had anticipated, but it actually works out for my wearing them during the upcoming springtime weather. i think, were it a colder season now, they wouldn\\'t work as well for my use. the colored band is fantastic if you want to pull it up high (almost like maternity pants! so comfy!) or, fold down to wear as intended for a solid yoga workout. i already can\\'t wait to order a few more pairs in various colors! *do note that shipping takes a while~ definitely a whole lot longer than the speedy shipping i\\'m used to with amazon. it took 10 days for my pants to arrive. as expected with rothco pants the buttons popped off they usually last a couple of weeks before this happens not with this pair first time i wore them. pants are great except for poor stitching on buttons but this is the case with every pair of rothco pants i have ever purchased so be prepared to sew buttons back on. i have also found if you have a 34 waist buy the large as the medium are to tight the large are slightly loose but nothing a belt wont take care of. i really like these leggings, they are super warm and soft inside, and after multiple washes, they are still super soft inside. the only thing that i didn\\'t like was that before i ever washed them they had about 1,000,000 pills on them! not the biggest deal in the world, but i don\\'t like to de-pill clothes, and for it do pill up in the middle of the first wear, well that sucks : p this item was for my daughter she loves it these pants are so soft and comfortable. the material is very good and they snug you in all the right places. i\\'m 5\\'8 210 pounds got a large and these fit so comfortable. when i opened the package i was a little nervous though cause they looked so small, but they stretch and they look awesome !! their low rise which i was looking for...hate those pants that go all the way up to your boobs. these are basically thick sweat pants leggings, they don\\'t really resemble jeans, just the set up of them have the jean feel. their so comfy though !!!!!!!! definitely buying more ! baby isn\\'t here yet but i\\'m sure it will fit perfectly on him. they were a little stiff straight from the package but were very soft after washing. these are now my favorite summer pjs. the silky fabric keeps me cool and comfy all night. i will be purchasing another pair for myself as well as for my daughters. this hat is a wonderful buy, my little never never want to take it off, he even goes to bed with it, only then can we get it off. i definitely recommend this !! these are great! it\\'s not my normal style but i really love them. they are very comfortable. note that they are a bit sheer so you may want to wear nude undies or something. i normally wear about a 2 and got a medium as they\\'re juniors sizing. i wear them on my hips rather than higher on my waist. i bought these mainly for snow removal.  waist is ok, but legs are quite long.  i plan to sew on more velcro on the bottom of the leg to tighten up around my boots so i am not walking on the pant legs. great quality fabric for a costume. ordered wrong size (my fault). they gladly exchanged with zero hassle. these are not velour (searching for velour, these came up) nor are they terry. they are more of a yoga-pant type fabric, but are floor-length - actually, these pants are really long - extra tall would be the size! but they are easily hemmed so no worries.very comfy and very complimentary to the backside! great for jammies.  no pulling anything over my babies head, which makes her angry.  i could let her crawl around in this all day if i needed to,  it looks like a smart little outfit.  sometimes i\\'m lazy but i hate that &#34; it\\'s 2 pm and my kid is still in pjs&#34; thing.  but if she\\'s feeling fussy i don\\'t feel like wrestling clothes we can go out without looking like a total slob.  i just pop a bow on her hair and she looks like a little lady. i ordered hufflepuff and got gryffindor... so disappointed, scared to try again i\\'ve been looking for some wide leg soft pants that fit more into the &#34;wide leg&#34; category than the &#34;palazzo&#34; category.  i\\'m not a fan of the palazzo style that are so wide that they end up looking more like circus pants or a skirt, but i love a light and airy wide leg. these fit that description.  for reference,  i‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 ~  145# ~  34b bust 28‚Äù waist 34‚Äù hips  and a pretty solid 6/8 in jeans.  i ordered these in a size small, the black damask print and the fit is spot on.  the length works well for me  (often an issue for us shorter girls).  i wash pants like these on gentle and line dry to avoid shrinkage, mis-shaping and fading.  i am hoping these will hold up with my gentle care.  i\\'d absolutely buy another pair if they do ! fits as expected, good quality of picture, received multiple comments when i wore it. would def buy it. good deal these are the perfect work pants.<br /><br />they are roomy, they look good and they are sturdy! i live near los angeles, and i wore these pants along with my muscle tee, and fanny pack out clubbing in hollywood last weekend.<br /><br />not only did i get the vip treatment at all the clubs (front of the line, free drinks, etc), but i ran into paris hilton, britney spears, jessica alba, and megan fox; and they all started fighting over me!<br /><br />these pants will change your life! very happy with the pants. they legs are long but very comfortable. great weight for cool days.  the pants fit well, and the top pulls over easily.<br />they wash nicely, retaining color and size.  more choices, please! by far the best fitting and made tactical pants i own! when they arrived, fabric was little stiff so i put them in the washer and that did the trick. countless pockets, reinforcements and cleverly made expandable waist makes them truly fantastic. sizing is right on the mark.<br />highly recommend them to all who needs comfortable practical and though pants. this pair is going with me for a mountain adventure in peru and chile and for hiking on easter island.<br />i will likely buy more. these were perfect for a recent trip out of the country. pocket is just right for some folded up paper money. it would hold small items such as jewelry, emergency bus fare, bathroom money, etc. the pocket is not big enough for passports and such. so far so good i wore it it didn\\'t split it didn\\'t dye my legs black, comfortable and flatter your figure i will get more when my bank allows me too! take a look at these pants, people. you think anybody wants a roundhouse kick to the face while i\\'m wearing these bad boys? forget about it. they are pretty fab pants - be advised that the l is a bit small.  other than that - love them! some of my daughter\\'s dresses didn\\'t come with bottoms, and they are needed!  these are perfect for use under jumpers are dresses.  great for hot summer days with a cute top too.  perfect sizing - love them! great pants! a little long, but i purchased in 3 colors. they\\'re quite flattering. the hot pants look exactly as they appear in the ad.  i wouldn\\'t have personally chosen them, because they are very short, but my granddaughter chose them for her junior dance division program and they were worn under a short pink skirt.  she looked adorable, and they arrived pretty quickly, so i was pleased with the purchase. good quality items, love it these pants work great, love the way my muscles feel warm and relaxed and they do exactly as promised.......make you sweat.  i have found my workouts to be easy wearing them, but the fit( being so highwaisted as a little uncomfortable for me, i am 5\\'1&#34;) could be better.  i have to roll the top down and the legs up.  i think i may order a pair of the shorts in the next size smaller and see how they work out.  overall i would recommend these if you like to feel like you have really had a workout, just the heavy sweat detox is good for you. i bought these a little big purposely becuase the sizing charts amazon uses don\\'t seem to match up with the link for sizing charts that i assume is provided by propper.  but that\\'s of little consequence as i wanted them large anyway.  the bdu pant is a good pant design.<br /><br />they are comfortable and i can move around very well in them.  the waist adjusts some although the adjustment straps won\\'t stay put for me.  i wear them with a belt; however, so they stay once the belt is on.<br /><br />the 4 button fly is not my favorite but it works.  it\\'s just hard to relieve one\\'s self on a cold winter day in the woods.  that is actually the only problem i have with the fly<br /><br />the pockets are large and pretty easy to access.  it can be hard to button the flaps on the rear pockets, but not that hard.  the bellows pockets are extremely large and i was able to button half of each one and still have access to them while keeping the flaps down.<br /><br />the cuffs are adjustable with ties.  the ties aren\\'t very long in my opinion and i\\'ve never used that feature on any pants, but it is there if you need it.  i left the cuffs as they were and tied the ties up so they aren\\'t dangling.<br /><br />i love the reinforced seat and knees.  i think these pants are durable and should last quite a while.<br /><br />finally, multicam (in my opinion) is the best all around camouflage ever made.  i will be testing these in various environments, but it is light enough to be useful in grass and sparse vegetation but can seem to \\\\\\\\\"darken\\\\\\\\\" in low lighting such as in wooded areas.  they say it seems to take on different shades depending on the surrounding areas and light.  i thought that was bogus but it truly does blend in better than other camouflage patterns over a wide variety of areas.  it is perfect for the area i live in.  having said that, no camouflage will ever be the perfect pattern in every environment.  i will be testing these against woodland and acupat in the near future in various areas and conditions.<br /><br />great pants, amazing camouflage!t pants, amazing camouflage! they are comfortable for any activity and wash well.<br>i wear them as an official for girl\\'s lacrosse.<br>they also  fit and look great for casual wear. my twin boys are tall. 9 months wearing 12-18mth clothing. these pants are excellent for lounging around in and are a great fit!! wish there were more colors to choose from! it fit me perfectly!!!! i love them i bought this for star themed gift basket. they didn\\'t fit the gift receiver because she is a little on the heavy side and the low rise  just didn\\'t work comfortably. they fit me so i kept them. walmart quality but i think they were only $12.00. they\\'re warm and soft. colors as pictured. easy to find a t or camisole to match colors. i purchased these pants and they are very high quality and true to size. you can\\'t go wrong on these.  buy them! these fit great!!! i was scared to purchase because no reviews. but these fit me exactly as i hoped. $15 was worth blowing on these soft fitted jeans. definately purchasing from this company again. buy these!!! haha and yes these fit snuggly hence what type of jeans they are. want them loose order big, want them to fit snuggle order your size. simply fit juniors very well. if womens, i suggest you order a bit larger. so cute - well made - soft material - will make a great gift for my wolf loving son in law i have found that all maternity clothes seem to run small.  so when shopping for my granddaughter, who usually wears medium, i took a chance and ordered large and they fit perfectly. awesome loved it i\\'ve been wearing these for years. i\\'m 5\\'9&#34; legs for days, and they are perfect. i wash them in cold water and hang dry as recommended. they are a perfect thickness and hide every flaw. will keep you cool in the heat, and warm in the cold. i live in san diego and i wear them year round. these literally will last you forever, day after day, wash after wash if you take care of them properly and will never stretch out. i do recommend washing them on cold in the washer with your other items and hanging them to dry. best way. only reason i\\'m ordering more is because i want more lol and my purple ones somehow have a tiny hole which is my fault. as others have stated, i hate purple normally but this purple is beautiful. kind of 80\\'s rock which is my style ;p. i\\'m totally worried these will get too popular and sell out so i\\'m stocking up! they are dirt cheap and you will get compliments everywhere you go! i have every color! one of the best finds on amazon! don\\'t tell too many people where you got these or they will become scarce! a bit baggy but well made. runs a tad small. i just had a baby so my belly is a bit squishy. i\\'m a size 10 jeans right now. ordered a large and they fit. the waist band does squish my postpartum chub a bit. it\\'s not uncomfortable, just have to wear a loose top with it.  really really comfy pants. these are great capris!  the looks is great and the they are fun and hug the body just right. the best thing about these are the stretch and they will allow you to move and live life without feeling them digging into your hips!  the material is a bit thin but they are a great value! very comfy and a flattering fit.  a medium fits my 5\\'6&#34; 135 pound frame perfectly! just perfect as others have said, these pants are very thin which is good for the hot climate where i live. they are very comfortable. i\\'m 5\\' 2&#34; so had to get them hemmed. i wear long shirts with my pants which is especially good with these pants because fabric this thin does show every figure flaw. this is my first day wearing them so this review may be a little premature. they do tend to slide down a bit. all that said, i think they are going to become a favorite of mine. i am tall (6\\'4) and skinny (185 lbs). i wear dress pants size 34/36. these small costume pants fit me well. there is an elastic in the back, a real zipper in the front, button and belt loops as well. the fabric is thin - will need to wear white underwear with it.  the legs may be a tad short, like 1-2 inches but because the flare it\\'s not an issue. important to me is that the waist fits well. exactly what i was expecting. fit and feel great! the pants were a hit, and everyone wanted to be me!!!! if you don\\'t wear these pants your clearly a communist! i bought these pants at my 15 week mark in pregnancy and they fit amazing!  they are the most comfortable pants i have ever bought.  the material is thin, but it really helps me be able to breathe when i wear these pants at home.  love, love, love them!  i am definitely going to be buying more pairs of these. great price for comfy and warm leggings. great product!! comfy and sexy. love these ulla popken delivers what it shows - both in appearance and  size.  i buy all my clothes from either up or woman within and i feel very comfortable.  of course i would feel more comfortable if i lost 50#.  sigh. and their colorful tunic tops are great! i ordered these in the 6-9 mo size for my 4 month old. he\\'s a big boy, but these fit him nicely, and still had room for him to grow. they are so soft! definitely my favorite pairs of pants for him. i wish they had them in more colors! this item was purchased as a christmas gift for my son.  he loves the seat belt buckle style belts and he also loves adventure time.  he is 21 but it was a perfect gift for him.  i love the quality and i know he is going to love it when sees it on christmas. these are really great, well made and shiny but sexy. they fit really tight i typically wear a size 10 and am 5\\'9&#34; so i got the medium yeah they are super tight but look very sharp. they were definitely long enough just wish i would have gotten a large. they are a perfect thickness not super thin but not thick rubbery. definitely recommend so i bought the deep purple and black in large i mean what the heck they were only 10.00 i will give the others to my skinnier friend or cram myself into them. these are good thick training pants that are cotton so the fabric will breathe.  i wouldn\\'t mind if they didn\\'t come up quite so high in the back, but that isn\\'t a big problem. still at kohls for  discounted for $16 from $25<br />i wore and they are cute<br />got many women asking me to &#34;show them the picture of elsa...wow that\\'s cool&#34; they said very comfortable. these are okay for my fairly casual work place. i found out i was pregnant after ordering them and i think i will be able to wear them for a lot of the pregnancy too. they are long and i had to hem them. fits well and works well i only tried them once so far. .. my wife liked it... i was concerned that at 125 -130 pounds and standing 5\\'8.5&#34; tall that the jumpsuit would be too short or small for my frame, but it is just perfect. i can wear as harem pants with the smocking rolled down at the waist or as a jumpsuit as shown in the photo. the pants are very blousy and full and drape well either way. the comfort is unsurpassed. great pants one of the best buys i could\\'ve made for myself for this winter! i highly recommend these! slim profile and goes under my jeans and my riding breeches. definitely would recommend to anyone looking for an extra layer of warmth to add to your wardrobe. my grand daughter was very happy with the vivian\\'s yoga pants.  she is over 6 foot tall and is hard to find pants long enough for her.  vivian\\'s pants fit her perfectly. i teach zumba, and for those of us who have thighs they are wonderful!  very comfortable!  i love them very much!  affordable too! they may be cheap but they fit and are comfortable to work in, especially if you have to do a lot of bending and squatting like gardening. i will be buying more. nice color...... item was as described and was shipped promptly i was well pleased i love these shorts. i brought these for a little extra support under mini skirts and dresses. i have brought about ten pairs so fair. i where 12/14 in womens and they fit me fine. i live in jacksonville florida so it is very hot here usually about 103 degrees in the shade. i love to sleep in these at night with a light weight shirt or tank top. i have two children, i am tandem nursing so it works great. i do not like to sleep in long hot pajamas. it is just to hot. i especially love that i can wear them under my dresses and feel more comfortable. i would not recommend wearing them alone. unless you are into showing all your business. but for the price, i love them. please don\\'t hesitate to buy! trip good quality as always!!! they last forever through very much wear and look good still after! i highly recommend. perfect fit i\\'m 5\\'6 and they\\'re long enough for me which is great! everything clings to them though which isn\\'t so great but they\\'re very comfy. and they\\'re flattering for the butt. oh they don\\'t get loose like some yoga pants either. great fit, nice fabric i really like this pants but it\\'s hard to wear if you have curves and it make me depress that i have trouble getting it over my hips and butt. so if you have curves you may need a size are two up for this. i would live in these pants if i could. i almost do. i wear them to work out in the early morning and then keep them on all day if i\\'m going to be home.  they actually look good enough to be worn out.  they are so comfortable they feel like pajamas. my girl loved the pjs. she gets to wear them when she comes over for sleepovers. she loves the warmth they provide decent pair of running pants and they were a good price but they are smaller/tighter than expected. i bought a medium and i am 5\\'10&#34; tall with a 32&#34; waist. they are an inch or two shorter than expected and tighter than i\\'d prefer. i guess i should have bought a large instead. hope this helps someone else out. just acquired my fg a-tacs today and they are very nice indeed. the quality on them is actually better than my issued bdu\\'s the fabric is similar to the new abu heavy fabric and is made to last. stitching is well done, although i did get it one size up they are still very comfortable. pattern it self is a darker green than some of the pictures will lead you to believe, it does blend well with overgrowth. i would have to say over all these are a great new uniform set for any one seeking to blend into a over grown / jungle or any temperate environment. only down side to the pants is possibly the belt loops they do not seem as sturdy as some of my abu\\'s hopefully time will tell on those however. like them. honest true 38inch inseam! for those looking for longer pants stop your search here! i\\'m 6\\'8 for a reference point<br /><br />nice soft material, true to size for both waist & length. adjustable waist cinches make odd waist sizes easy.<br /><br />only recommendations would be to add small pockets in the cargo area\\'s on the legs. i have other tactical pants (vertex) that have a small pocket that holds a cell phone vertical and keeps smaller items from flopping around in the cargo pocket. they don\\'t match these pants when it comes to length though.<br /><br />material is not as strong as you\\'d find with tactical type gear but for me that\\'s the trade off i have to live with because of my height. i just ordered every color they have to stockpile!<br /><br />update:<br /><br />6 months: some suggestions to the manufacture, replace the metal snaps with velcro or plastic buttons. i have noticed that the metal snap has marked up my seat in my car plus they\\'re never stay snapped. also the cargo pockets in my opinion are too baggy. still like them, wear them every week.still holding up very well and they\\'ve been worn quite a bit! the sport pants are great; however, the merchant did not ship the order in a timely fashion. for the colors and the way it look.it will look good on me for partys or for any where i go a gift for christmas.  happy with it! my son loves his bright spongebob tee - thanks! great! the picture is spot on for how they look and fit me.  bit too long, but i\\'m short 5\\'3&#34;, so it would be nice if a petite version available,<br />but that said, i loved the texture look of the fabric, but they are ultra soft and comfortable (like well worn in flannel).  i wear them all the time and they seem to be holding up. bought these for my husband they fit very nice and are very well made.. he said they are very comfortable. well i just got my pants today on july 5 2013 an tried them on fit really nice an they have no reinforced knee pads so that was a plus for me i recommended these pants to any one i will be ordering another pair in woodland an two for black .. my daughter loves these!!!! very nice<br />i like it<br />it\\'s comfortable!<br />and good quality love it this was my first time ordering clothing from china & apparel sense didn\\'t disappoint. they arrived within 5 days &, though they\\'re a bit tough to pull on because of the spandex, they\\'re the most comfortable bottoms i now own & actually fit! the size on the leggings is described as &#34;one size fits all,&#34; &#34;one size fits most&#34; on the item page, but that\\'s in traditional chinese sizing; i\\'m american (5-foot-6 & a little over 200 pounds, though i\\'m trying to lose weight) & the sizes are very different, but i\\'m happy to say that these actually fit. i\\'ll definitely order more stuff from a.s. in the future. mj is one of a kind. best joggers i\\'ve seen. you won\\'t find these in a ordinary store locally period!!!! normally wear large product is tight<br />wear around the house<br />material is soft, and clingy<br />i love wearing it feels good makes me feel sexy<br />quality of the product is good i love the joggersüòÅüòÅüòÅ it¬¥s beautiful great first off, these are definitely worth the price.  what you have here is a mid-layer ski pants.  these are not intended to be worn as a base layer (they have zippers all over that will be irritating without long underwear or base layer underneath) and it is not water proof to be worn strictly as outer &#34;ski pants&#34;, especially in bad weather or if you find yourself on the ground quite a bit.  but, if you have a base layer and you have waterproof pants like i do, this is an excellent mid layer to add warmth without a lot of bulk during especially cold days or high altitudes.<br /><br />my pants had a label inside indicating these are for people taller than 71&#34;, so intended for those 5\\'11&#34; or taller.  i am around a 33-34&#34; waist and the medium was plenty roomy.<br /><br />i will give them a shot next time i\\'m out in very cold weather as a mid-layer, but just wearing them around the house, they seem pretty well made and certainly worth their space in my ski bag. super super soft! we got this is in \\\\\\\\\"bark\\\\\\\\\" and in \\\\\\\\\"moss.\\\\\\\\\" love them both! they are absolutely adorable on a newborn. i use these under my waders fishing and duck hunting and they are super. they also work great on the colder days under wind pants x-country skiing. thanks much. i am losing weight and they fit very well and made me look good.  it has given me strength to keep going. love them these pants were very comfortable and as far as uniform-appropriate pants go, far more flattering than most other styles. the fabric is soft and thin without being flimsy and they held up very well after being worn and washed 3-5x a week for a 6 month seasonal job. i liked it the blue fabric is a little different shade from the captain america hoodie i ordered which is rather disappointing. this is a christmas gift so i cannot comment on fit, comfort, etc at this time. i bought 5 different prints of these for my wife and they look great and they look very sexy.  the lighter colors are worn with shorts over them.  i\\'m a happy husband. these are great! i use them for wind and rain public transit commutes.  they slip on over your regular pants and have zippers at the bottom of each leg so you can fit your booted feet through. if the rain clears up later, you can easily fold these up and put them in your purse (if it isn\\'t too small) or backpack.  the material feels like a cottony, weaved paper, but is very durable and-- even though it is a type of 100% recycled plastic--very breathable. i love these because they are long but they are a little tight in the thighs. i have thin legs so if you have thicker legs you should definitely get one size up. these pants fit perfect and are a stretchy material! great buy for the price and can be dressed up or down! love love love them! they are so comfy!! i would recommend these to anyone!! i just had a baby so these feel amazing to exercise in and lay around the house love these pants! fits well, and the legs are a little long (because i\\'m only 5\\' 2&#34;), but they look fantastic and are perfect for my costume. these pants fit awesome! i am 5\\'10 and weigh 160 lbs (i just had a baby 2 months ago) and have larger hips. i wanted some fun pants that would be long enough and flattering but also give some grace to my tummy area. i purchased a large just to be on the safe side and they fit great! they don\\'t give me a muffin top but they are snug enough that as i lose the baby weight, they will still fit really well.  i can wear flip flops and they just slightly touch the ground. looking forward to purchasing more in the future!! i\\'ve tried two different 2-in-1 potty training pants with my 2 year old son. this solution is superior to the bummis pants. these fit snugly around the legs and butt, but allow enough room to breathe. the bummis were very baggy, and once you washed them, they took forever to dry in the dryer. the potty scotty pants don\\'t take nearly as long to dry. they offer a solution to keep your kid from getting their pants wet, but at least they know they\\'ve wet their pants.<br /><br />i would say size wise - they were true to size for our son, but he is on the leaner side. love these, they look like real sweatpants. comfortable and baggy (to hide those legs i know u guys don\\'t work out!!)<br />can wear it high-waisted to make your chest look bigger. my son only wears organic or oeko-tex 100 standard certified clothing.<br /><br />kicky pants meets the latter standard, and has an astonishingly transparent manufacturing process. honestly, this should be the standard of information that all baby products are required to share: ([...]).<br /><br />i adore kicky pants. they are soft as satin, stretchy (so that they fit for far longer, saving mama money) and wash beautifully.<br /><br />my son now has at least three kp at any stage. üëå fabric was thinner than i expected i\\'m very satisfied both with pants that i ordered and service. the quality of of these bell bottoms are high. they are on thick end. nice material, the bells hang nicely. they do not have a banded waist, just a thin band, not very flattening or flattering if you are big in that region. they are a bit high waisting, about an inch under my belly button,  i ordered a large (10). i am usually a 9 or 10 in jeans. i have a thin waist and thick thighs. they were a bit tight on my thighs, a little too tight for my liking. overall, i like them. i have gain a few pounds lately, hoping they are better fitting when i lose the weight! would recommend. my son is 10 months old, 31 inches tall and 21 pounds.  initially i ordered the 12-18 month size, but ended up returning all but one for the 18-24 size.  it was a tight fit and even though 12-18 mos fit him, i wanted something he could grow in to  they are so, so soft and my son seems to like them a lot (at least there are no protests unlike his footie pjs).  however, after opening all the coveralls i noticed that the leg lengths were different for all three.  my husband saw them laid out and said, &#34;it looks like a goldie locks \\'three bears\\' situation.&#34;  we had a short, medium and tall... see picture.  the arm and crotch lengths are all the same... it\\'s just the legs that are all different.  he\\'s tall enough to do okay with the shorter two, but i\\'ll probably store the long one until fall when he won\\'t trip on the excess fabric. but i am so impressed with the quality, softness and snap strength that i won\\'t be ordering any other brand of pjs.  ** natural was the shortest coverall, light blue was the medium, and twilight was the long** these pants are great.  easy to move in and never get twisted up in poses.  they are pretty sheer but i just wear boyshorts underneath. they length is great too because you can just pull the material up higher at the waist if you want them shorter.  my son and i both have a pair of mediums and they fit us great.  they\\'re unisex.  i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; about 130-135lbs and my son is 5\\'8&#34; about 145lbs. great value for the price, fits perfect and very comfy i love these lounge bottoms. they laundry up so easy and look great all the time. i bought pink, gray, white. i will buy more. i had yoga pants from wal-mart that fit really well, size large. i bought these in a large as well and they are tighter than the wal-mart ones. i did find they were a bit sheer when stretched around \\\\\\\\\"thunder thighs\\\\\\\\\". i am 5\\'6\\'\\' and about 150lbs. great length and i am sure a better fit when i lose a few pounds :) great quality and fit!!! i ordered cheaper types but very unhappy. these are excellent. i wear them although i am not pregnant but neve got rid of the post baby belly with my youngest. everyone loved it. said they feel great. i do love these pants - why not? recommended by oprah! but i am 5\\'10 - they are a little too short - that\\'s why the 4 stars. these are great for travel, especially if you ever order room service. i just wish they came in long. the pants are cute comfy and amazing<br />the only thing is they run small on me<br />im 5\\'8 so if you\\'re shorter they probably will fit<br />also pretty see through i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; so these are a bit long for me.  my husband loves them as they are nice and snug. very good quality and no see thru at all. if only i were 3&#34; taller. arrived on time, good quality no issues this is a great buy,material is great and is true to size fits in the waist but kinda long these pants fit well and feel like you are wearing pajamas! they are so comfortable! they look great with the hi-low tunic, also sold through amazon. i purcahsed these pants to wear while i take my daily walk after work.  i was expecting just a nylon shell that i would have to wear over long underwear or jeans.  these are really nice!  fully lined with trico and a mesh liner  in the \\\\\\\\\"shorts\\\\\\\\\" area.  they come with a clever cord closure at the ankles to seal out the elements.  they seem impervious to wind and rain and are very comfortable.  very well made.  i should have gotten two pair!<br /><br />these are really more than i expected. just received these today and they are amazing! initially,  they looked small for a medium,  but when i put them on they fit perfectly.  i am 5\\'10 and weigh 124 so i have a difficult time finding pants long enough but not these - length is perfect.<br />i ordered the navy and they do resemble denium due to the wash which also makes them super soft. hoping they wash and wear well because i have fallen in love with how super comfy they are. absolutely the best yoga pants i have ever seen. these are great training pants.  we prefer non-waterproof underwear because they are more comfortable and easier to tell if there has been an accident.  they feel like real underwear so he knows when he\\'s wet, but won\\'t allow the urine to puddle down to the floor at every accident. adorable little pants that mix and match well with carters and non-carters tops. ruffled butt is super cute. i wish they came in more color options. just wore these pants in 18 degree weather and they were great. they kept my legs nice and warm while out taking pictures for a few hours. i ordered it big because some costumes can run smaller. not this this was huge but easy to remedy. i corrected it to fit and to be honest was surprised by the quality of material. i needed a hippy costume, which this filled and because it was so comfortable it is now pajamas and a leisure wear. love the feel of the fabric. perfect fit, good quality, and very comfortable. i will definitely be purchasing another pair! pants are soft and comfortable.  delivery was prompt too. i have to say. when i bought a pair of these rad threads, i didn\\'t expect to win a guest spot on mtv\\'s jersey shore! i was totally psyched that mtv and the world was going to realize my amazing fashion sense! let me tell you, that these bad boys looked sick after a session in the tanning booth. i mean, i didn\\'t even have to air brush my abs on wearing these things. the pants did it all for me. the abs just looked sexy all on their own. with my gold chain and blow back going on, i\\'m totally going to get laid in a spa while acting like a complete shmuck on national television. snooki, holla at me girl. you know you will, dog. oh, snap! these are off da hook!<br /><br />jay \\\\\\\\\"the impression\\\\\\\\\" giuliani i brought dimore baby training pants infant underwear set for my second baby. i believe this makes my training much easy. its easy to pull up and pull down. its has nice absorb ability. nice got a pair of these for my girl friend. she likes them alot. the medium fit her well. (5\\'10&#34; 130lbs). the only downside to them, is the material is a little thin.they aren\\'t see through though. i bought 2 more pairs in different colors because she said they were comfy and the price was right. i bought these to accommodate my growing baby bump.  i\\'m not ready for maternity clothes and these are working out great in the transition.  the fold over waist band is snug on my hips and doesn\\'t roll or stretch out.  these are pretty low rise, which is great for me, but i have to be sure to wear a shirt long enough.  i am 5\\'2&#34; 117lb.  the small is a great fit.  just like the picture. great it is a tad bit too small. these are comfy, and not see through! the only thing is the pants are a little long, but nothing a little alterations can\\'t fix. the scrubs were perfect.  the fit worked perfect also.  the scrubs were of good material and solid, good craftsmanship.  they are very comfortable and not so wrinkled that i have to iron each time they are washed.  very pleased with the scrubs and would definately order again if needed.  price was the best i could find also. my job requires a lot of field work in an urban area, and these pants have proven to be ideal and more than worth the price. the two front pockets are deep and secure your valuables, and the cell phone pocket holds a phone perfectly. overall, i was pleased with the placement of all the pockets on the pants, and with the fit. i also appreciated the free belt that the pants come with. i was skeptical about the fabric\\'s ability to resist liquids, but last week i did three and a half hours of field work in pouring rain and the rain literally rolled right off of the pants. when i got home, i was impressed that i was bone dry from the waist down, the pants weren\\'t even damp and didn\\'t need to be hung up to dry. overall, for the price these pants are a steal, and they are so well made that i\\'m sure they will last for years. i\\'m not sure about the metabolism properties advertised. i just wanted them to sweat more, which helps me with my edema. at the risk of achieving tl;dr‚Ä¶<br /><br />first, let\\'s get this out of the way: yes, the pants are left long by the manufacturer. they are sewn of non-fraying fabric, and you are meant to cut them to the length that you like. no hemming is necessary, unless you want a very finished look (and expect people to be eyeballing your ankles so closely).<br /><br />i am 5\\'6&#34;, 150lbs., and i bought the large in solid black. the pants are, as shown in the vendor photos, clingy in the hips/butt area and roomy elsewhere (including the waistband, but i have a waist/hip ratio that does this to me no matter what i buy). the fabric is very stretchy, so there\\'s probably a lot of leeway across sizes. the style\\'s cling and thinness of the fabric (that\\'s thin, but not sheer, at least not the black) does require giving thought to what undergarments you wear beneath. if you get one of the wildly patterned pairs, your vpl may not be so v anyway, but don\\'t count on it.<br /><br />i had a pair of pants very similar to this a gazillion (okay, 20) years ago, and i wish i\\'d never gotten rid of them. thank goodness i found these! great for traveling, they don\\'t wrinkle and dry very quickly so you can freshen them up if necessary in a hotel room sink. comfortable enough for just about anything, they dress up for an evening out as easily as they can be worn to the office or running errands. i\\'ll definitely be buying more in other colors. i am 5\\'9&#34; 170 lbs, 33&#34; waist, 40.5&#34; hips/butt. the xl fits perfect. i was going to order large based on the specs in the size chart but miri armoza responded quickly to my inquiry and advised me that she would send the size that would fit. thanks miri, for your help! i love the fit and it shows off my backside wonderfully! ideally, i would love to have this product in a high waist version. i bought these for my wife and she loves them. i think she looks awesome in them. great fit comfy. these pants fit just as i hoped they would. they are not to thin or thick. i will probably buy more in different colors. comfortable, long lasting through many washes. true to size and sooo comfortable. i ended up buying the bootcut version of these pants the next day. comfy and well fitting. very sturdy fabric, fit a little smaller than i needed. i purchased the large and it was too big, however you can adjust the waist, so they work.  fast delivery, recommend! love these pants!  fit great and wash well!  highly recommend them! and what i was looking for was not the top-of-the-line or the trendiest, but an inexpensive pair of snow pants of decent quality that fit well and if they had extra pockets too, then perfect.  these guide gear cargo snow pants definitely met my expectations.  they are warm, but not too warm, and the size large i ordered fit perfectly lengthwise and at the waist.  they also fit nicely with my [[asin:b0078j8918 kamik men\\'s greenbay4 boot]]s.  as others have noted, the drawstring doesn\\'t stay put, so if you find that you need to cinch it up, you\\'ll need to either tie it or consider downsizing.  i fully recommend these pants if you just need a pair of snow pants that \\\\\\\\\"just get the job done.\\\\\\\\\" great quality. i get a lot of compliments when i wear these. i wasn\\'t expecting a whole lot for the price, but these have exceeded my expectations. best of all, they aren\\'t sheer, so you don\\'t have to worry about something covering your butt. they look very cute with an oversized t-shirt and doc martens. great material for the price. good quality over all. the material is a bit thin, but it isn\\'t see through. however, i\\'m 5\\'2, and 110lbs, so the length is a bit long. it touches the ground, but doesn\\'t drag. not too tight, but not too loose. if they had an x-small, it would probably be perfect for me. well worth the price. love these pants way small, but i didn\\'t notice that this was asian size. i had a good experience with the return and the customer service. these pants fit me perfectly!...ordered the 18/20 i normally wear a 16...but i ordered up a size!!...so glad i did...the length was perfect i am 5\\'10\\\\\\\\\"  the waist fit perfect.. a needed part of a two year old\\'s wardrobe!  great fit. as comfortable as jeans<br />as tough as leather<br /><br />these pants are worth every penny. they fit perfect, they are tough strong but comfortable.  the pockets are in the perfect spots, yet they are subdued, they do not scream out \\\\\\\\\"cargo pants\\\\\\\\\". they shrunk in the wash, so i ordered a larger size. these are great....... i actually bought these because i was having a difficult time finding &#34;boy-cut&#34; swim bottoms. they are exactly what i was looking for and at a great price too! the bottoms fit perfectly but note that i am a size 0/2. while they are very stretchy, i imagine they\\'d be uncomfortable if you consider yourself a size medium or larger. just an fyi since the product is described as one-size-fits-all. definitely the stretchiest and most comfortable pair of leggings i own! thinking about buying more! although they get a little see-through when being stretched, i throw another pair underneath and i\\'m set. but outstanding otherwise i have purchased several pairs of these scrub sets. they do run large so order one size smaller than you normally wear. also they are not consistent. some are cut a little smaller than others. all in all they are a great buy and i would recommend them. thank you! there super confy and i am sure i look better than batman .... these are the most comfortable pants i own!  tie dye colors are great, and the quality is excellent.  got lots of compliments.  i ordered the black and white and brown/turquoise, but will be ordering the dark blue also................. great quality, fits just right, it arrived on time, and with great price. these pants are very comfortable and i would order again in the future. i ordered brown, which is a little darker than i wanted but i\\'m still happy with purchase since they are comfortable and the length is perfect. fast shipping.excellent fit and comfy zander can\\'t go to sleep without his blanket swaddled with the softness of this blanket! wonderfully baby gift for a newborn i really hate when it\\'s time for school and my daughter always complaint and complaint about her pant its too tight even thought is it the right side, soo i decided this school yr to buy her these stretchy pants and i didnt regret aat all but 5 pairs in this same pant...i do not hear any more complaint. good quality, nicely constructed corduroy jeans for this amazingly<br />low price.  takes a while for shipment from canada, but worth the<br />wait! i love these leggings. they look really good on me. i am small in stature but i like the way they fit. i bought a medium. it is a little loose at the bottom but i wore it with my black ankle boots. black and gold is my theme for this year and these leggings gave me the look i wanted. they don\\'t ichi and the material is ok. the design looks good. i highly recommend these leggings for night life or parties. looks fine. fits well. happy with purchase. my baby hasn\\'t come yet, but i love the colors and the material! too thin for wearing alone. love the color and they fit well. use them under other clothing would be best.<br />large would fit a little bit bigger than 32 inch waist if your thighs were smaller. very cute and sexy. had to alter the straps for better fit, otherwise i love it. the button broke in half before my daughter ever wore it :( these sweat pants are perfect! i did size up, i\\'m usually a size 3 in jeans and the large was perfect without being tight and not too baggy either. i highly suggest these to everyone! it was too large and that\\'s just because i went with the waist measurement.  should have gone with the hips and it would have worked well.  the pants are really well made and i love the style. i am very happy with this purchase.  i ordered the small and they are flattering but not too tight.  the length is just right on me, i am 5\\'5&#34;.  great for the price! bought these pants to wear through my pregnancy. super comfortable and stretchy, was able to wear through my changing belly size. also was able to dress up and still feel comfortable. would recommend to anyone, pregnant or not. fannel is nice thin type.  perfect it is very nice, and fits nicely. i have told a few friends about this one. love the bottoms =) aside from being a bit larger than expected this is exactly what i wanted. my issue clothing (including acu fr trousers) has always been medium regular, so that\\'s how i ordered these. they seem to fit more like a medium long though and compared to my acus the waist is slightly larger as well, only by an inch or so though so not a big deal there. i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; without boots and if i wanted to wear these in a garrison environment i\\'d definitely have to tuck them into my boots or use blousers as opposed to using the drawstrings like i usually do. again, not a big deal, just something to be aware of if you\\'re going to buy these. next time around i\\'ll be ordering medium short.<br /><br />other than that, the pants are great. all pockets aside from the calves have button closures which has always been a plus in my book. any questions, feel free to ask. i love this outfit. nice material, pants fit just perfect around the waist, and the hood is great for baby\\'s head, unlike some others we have that fit too big. these are very comfortable, warm, and cozy. i love the pattern...i must have for anyone who love winnie the pooh. they fit great! i\\'m tall and slim they fit me perfectly! can\\'t wait to order more. cozy! warm and soft! super cute! have not tried it on yet but seems very well made and material feels very comfy. i got these on tuesday morning and haven\\'t taken them off yet. i feel stronger, smarter, better looking, and am ready to rescue europe in world war iii. also, since i\\'ve put them on, the us hasn\\'t lost in the world cup!<br /><br />i\\'m tall and the l/xl are a great fit. they\\'re a little more mc hammer than hipster, but the fabric is surprisingly durable. the pockets are the perfect size to hold 7 or 8 fruit roll-ups.<br /><br />read the tag: do not iron! grandson loves them great pants. the design shows culture and heritage<br />color is also nice, the cut is nice suitable for horsemen & bike rider to protect from wind a bit snug so maybe order a size up. otherwise very comfy & a bit longer than expected. which is good because most fit me a bit too short. (i\\'m 114lbs & about 5&#34;8) hard to find tall/slim pants. love these! i love them makes me look very nice. however if u are a medium order small. i am a medium and when i was ordering only small was left, i loved it so much that i did not care and still ordered it and its just my size. not to small and not to big. fits perfectly. i believe am going to order this pants in ever available colour awsome!!! my granddaughter loved these yoga pants!  they were true to size and good quality! my size should be a medium according to the size chart, but when it arrived, i could barely get it on over my hips! they were a good height for me at 5\\'1&#34;, however (which was pleasantly surprising). but they are so comfortable and look similar to real jeans, especially with the jegging craze going on. these are wonderful! they fit comfortably and they look good. i am 5ft 5, 160 lbs, size 12. i carry my weight evenly all over. the m/l is the perfect length and fit. they can be worn higher on the waist with sandals or flats, and lower on the waist if you wear heels. i really like them cozy...just as expected. i got these for my girlfriend and we both love them.  good quality, good fit, good price -- sexy!.  but i would not recommend wearing them outside unless you want her to get arrested or molested.  these are more like underwear, very revealing -- the pink was practically see-through! my daughter loves this pant and got many compliments on them. easy for her to roll up and button the legs on her own. very sturdy. this belt is awesome exactly what i expected and plan on buying many more just like it!!! loved this pants got this brand as a christmas present two years ago.  i wear them constantly. i have put them through hell and back and they have held up extremely well.  i tried different brands, but the waistband of the others cut me in half and were uncomfortable...an the material at the thighs on the first wearing pilled up and got rough.  my thighs do touch (as they should) but i\\'m not a big woman by any means.  the alki\\'i pants didn\\'t do any of that. i also have three newfoundland\\'s (one is light brown)  and two white cats...and i haven\\'t had a problem with sticking fur.  they have kept their shape over the two years (better than i have mine!), are very comfortable, the waistband doesn\\'t cut in or roll...an when i dyed them jet black again, they looked brand new.  since i can\\'t find this brand in the stores i will be ordering them through amazon! it is last years style but a real classic. i love to wear them. very soft. they regularly cost $125. if god himself had decided to put pants on adam and eve, there is no doubt he would have put a pair of these zubaz pants on both of them.  but god chose them to be nekkid...i think he made a bad choice. these are very nice pants.  soft and cozy.  nice waistband. i wear a 2x. i ordered a 2x. they are perfectly true to size. i am approx 5\\'7 and they are not too short but, for taller ladies may be. they are extremely comfortable and i am glad i put the money out for these. they are great for comfort while remaining professional. good cute, soft, fits just right. more designed for girls they fit well.  they are the right length.  they are comfortable.  i can wear them with anything from tee to jacket for work.  i love them. as expected definitely need to wash them more than once to soften the fabric up to something you would want to lounge out in. i was worried that these pants wouldn\\'t fit properly or that the leg wouldn\\'t be long enough (i\\'m a 5\\'11 guy) but it looks amazing. i get compliments everywhere i go. my new favorite pants! it\\'s a little tight around the hip when putting it on, but once on it fits fine. customer service was great! my order came super early and fast. i am 5\\'2 and weigh 120. i ordered a medium, and they fit just like the photo. so cute. i would order a size up. this is a great price too! i\\'m 5\\'4\\\\\\\\\", 120 lbs and i ordered the small size in both pink and purple waistband.<br /><br />happy to report that they both fit perfectly - though maybe could have gone with the xs.<br />the length is fine - they skim the floor and tops of my bare feet. in shoes they are not hitting the floor.<br /><br />material is soft and just stretchy enough.<br /><br />fold over is very long - probably could wear into pregnancy! but they look nice on a non-pregnant figure!<br /><br />just hoping there is enough spandex (13%) to keep them in shape through a whole day of wearing.<br /><br />given yoga pants cost upward of 30=80 dollars - these are a great buy! very nice,  long just how i like them. i am a 37 or size 5. there small fits perfect. the material is not sheer and fairly thick (compared to other ones) so far im in love and will be buying more, love the pants! its cute ordered for 16 year old.  fit was perfect.  a little thinner than i was expecting but still a great lounge pant. excellent perfect fit, nice quality fabric, wash very well (note: i usually air dry). gorgeous & great fit. makes me feel so sexy!!! it was worth waiting 3 weeks for it to arrive!!! great pajama-bottoms, very well-made. they are pre-shrunk and do not seem to be shrinking much with subsequent washings at home.  so, while i normally buy size l pj\\'s from old navy or elsewhere, i might\\'ve been better off with an m here.  still, they are very comfortable and soft, although they are not flannel-soft or thick.  if you would dare be seen out in them, they are totally solid enough to be worn outside the home. well it was fast shipping and fast delivery and the fit is perfect i stand 5ft. 11 in. and they still touch the ground by like an inch and a half so they are perfect. love them hey what can i say, except that if you got the game then you need the gear. i am so in love with these pants. the fit is wonderful, the length long, but i am short. i am short and they still look great. i have received many compliments on them. i just ordered another pair a few minutes ago. comfortable, but still can be dressed up. i had serious doubts about these pants for me... i\\'m 5\\'10\\\\\\\\\" and depending on manufacturer sizing, can run from a 14 to 18.  i usually get misses sizing, but i walk that sizing line between misses and women\\'s closely.  shapely and large, my legs are also large and well developed, and often skinnies that fit my legs don\\'t fit elsewhere.  finally i decided to take a chance on the xl of these pants.  first i ordered the charcoal, and later black, and there were some differences.<br /><br />when the package arrived and was opened, my heart sank - sooo teensy - the charcoal pair looked like they were made for a child!  holding the waist of the pants up to my own waist, i thought \\\\\\\\\"not a chance\\\\\\\\\"...  still, i wrangled those puppies slowly up, and darned if they didn\\'t stretch out tremendously and become button-able and zip-able at the waist!  plus- my muscular legs did not take up too much of the pant material - i still have about 2 inches of cuff or slouch left at the bottoms, perfect for over or inside or slouched at the top of boots, and they even look good with flats.<br /><br />when i read the reviews here of these long-titled \\\\\\\\\"premium soft cotton stretch fitted jegging style leggings button skinny pants\\\\\\\\\" the descriptions of the item seemed all over the place, perhaps owing to what one considers a \\\\\\\\\"jegging\\\\\\\\\" vs. jeans vs. leggings.  i hope my review can make this a little clearer, because it is likely to be worth the purchase if you know what you\\'re getting.<br /><br />the charcoal pair i got has a fabric breakdown of \\\\\\\\\"85% cotton, 10% polyester, 5% spandex\\\\\\\\\".  obviously, the fabric is not denim, but the garment is cut and styled to look like jeans.  (\\\\\\\\\"machine wash cold, hang to dry, made in pakistan\\\\\\\\\" - not in the usa as stated in the product description.  my guess is that machine drying will make the polyester/cotton blend pill.)  mine ride a bit below my waist, just at the navel.  there\\'s jeans-like double stitching (same color, non-contrasting) along all the seams (except the single stitched inseam) and there\\'s double stitched waist, ankles, fly, functional front change pocket, and belt loops.  the main front pockets have double stitching too, but they are non-functional (closed) pockets.  mine fit like a second skin, so i doubt those loops will see a belt anytime soon!  no butt-gap, and comfy too.  the cool thing is that as tight as these skinnies are, the material is thick and soft, so undergarment lines aren\\'t showy, and if you have ripply thighs, i doubt they\\'d show.  the fabric might remind you of thin sweats, as the lining is ever so slightly wuzzy, but the outside is smooth.<br /><br />the brand name on the interior tag is echoed on the silver fly button \\\\\\\\\"miss fit\\\\\\\\\".  they are not carefully crafted (mine had a few stitching flaws and dangly threads to trim) but nothing anyone will notice but you.  if your body challenges the stretch too much, you might pop a stitch here or there.  after 2 wearings, the stitching below one belt loop has pulled away from the rest of the pant leaving a small hole my needle will fix in 2 minutes.  ditto along the butt seam.  it is because of this that i think i am at or a bit above the upper size limit for these pants.  these issues were insignificant enough to me i confidently ordered black too, which fit differently.<br /><br />after the initial wearing, they were stretched out, but not so much that the second wearing was baggy- they were just stretched enough to fit nicely again.  i plan on coming back to edit this review further after a few washings.  the butt pockets are small (which might make your butt look bigger).  personally, i will feel most comfortable this winter treating them like leggings and wearing them with longer sweaters that will cover the waist and a bit of the butt, but you might be more body-confident and wear them more like jeans.  that\\'s what i think is so interesting about these pants - you can make them be whatever you want them to be!<br /><br />the black pair i subsequently ordered was a little different - it did not look like a child\\'s pair out of the box, and was far easier to get on.  the tag is the same as the charcoal pair so the named size and fabric contents seem identical... thus, i have to think the sizing is inconsistent.  while i can wear both pairs, and both are close to skin tight, the black feels less tight and more comfortable.  nonetheless, i\\'m happy with both.<br /><br />i\\'m adding a few pictures of my first pair, so take a second to view them if you\\'d like to see the styling as well as the inside and outside fabric close-ups.  hope this helps anyone undecided like i was! i love it! fits me perfectly. i\\'m 5\\'9<br />texture is nice. its a bit see through but its worth it. love it! these pants are exactly what you need for military sims in paintball or airsoft, are comfortable and feature 2 underbelt adjustment straps and straps at the ankles to tighten. these pants have 2 back pockets and 2 thigh pockets, one on each thigh. the only bad thing is that there is no fly zipper, rather there are buttons, but no biggie. overall great pants, just make sure you double check your size before ordering! the yoga pants are great!  true to size, light yet sturdy.  they look great on and are extremely comfortable for the amazing price.  i just love them! my 12 month old is a peanut, and 6-12 month baby soy clothes are a little loose or the perfect fit.  their size charts are pretty accurate.  we love all of their products, particularly the hoodie and these pants.  these are lined, so they are cozy and perfect for the cold weather, whereas the slip on pants are light and more for spring/fall. i just received my legging in black, i have to say i was really nervous because i read the reviews before ordering and i gain some weight, and i thought i was gonna have a problem getting into them, wow, i was amazed at how they looked small when i took them out the plastic, i put them on thinking i wasted my money but they fit and they are gorgeous, love them thanks these pants are very comfortable so i bought two pair and i just love them both. easy fitting when i need to grab something to put on. the fabric is eye catching but since it\\'s not stretch, beware of rips because it fits tightly. a small is a 2, not a 4. these are baggy pants nice and thin for warmer weather. ordered four items from vivid linens and loved all of them but had to reorder them in a size larger than i normally wear, the pants are so comfortable, i don\\'t want to take them off! a little small in the crotch area, but in all other areas i loved them!  length was great , i am only 5\\'3.  the material feels so good!  i teach history and we have been learning about egypt!  my students loved them! these diaper covers had a great feel, wonderful color retention, and perfect stretch! very cute under little dresses and dose not pinch or pull at baby\\'s skin. washed many times and did not fade light cotton that stays in place and breathes. much better than synthetic materials in my opinion. i was so sick of longjohns with the saggy crotch so i tried these and they are perfect. i only wish they made a heavier weight version for very cold weather. i really like these pants. they fit very well.  i received this product free for my honest review.  i would recommend these to anyone who jogs. great faux leather leggings.  i love that they are still very stretchy and stay on! my last pair kept sliding off my bum :(  i ordered the matte black which are exactly what i wanted, not too shiney.  when i wear them, everyone thinks they are real leather!  i normally wear a 6 and they fit great! awesome! for the price, you\\'re getting a good quality product! i\\'m very happy! even better, you are also getting a working belt with it. no complaints! i really love these pant they are extremely comfy but i do feel the need to say that  they are bigger that expected i\\'m 5\\' 7 and usually i fit into men\\'s sizes yet these are pretty long on me they fit great everywhere except they\\'re too long. i am 5 foot 7. im not short. they shouldn\\'t be so long. love them finally, comfy, affordable yoga pants that barely shrink in the wash! the fit is really great for yoga or athletics - it\\'s a tight fit but without inhibiting movement or constricting the waist. very comfortable! love the way this fits! exactly what i wanted.  wish they had more colors. i got what was described!!! these are great pants. they fit a little snug in the seat and are roomy in the legs. that\\'s exactly what i was looking for. i\\'ve only worn these a few times and have gotten compliments already. they just arrived today; and i\\'m so excited to wear them out( even if i look weird lol) they came in just a couple days after i ordered them! they are a little tight but if i lose a couple pounds they should fit better on me xd i love them ,but when i ordered a second pair i ordered small isted of med. i haven\\'t got much of a butt bout too much middle. the elastic waist in a small still fits my middle fine. length was fine with both pairs. i love them thank you very much for your product i will enjoy it very much! &#60;3 i\\'ve received so many compliments since i received my harem pants.  they are so versatile and fashionable.  i wasn\\'t sure what the quality would be like considering the price point but they are absolutely worth it. these were also a present and will eventually fit.  the mother thinks these are very cute. on time, on price, on quality.  the pants are exactly as described.  i would recommend them. i\\'m a size 2 and these pants in size 3 fit nicely. i like them because they\\'re not only athletic, but were surprisingly flattering; they\\'re lower cut than usual jogger pants, which end at your waist. i would recommend these for sure. they are a great deal for the price.<br /><br />i received this product in exchange for my honest review. so nice to be able to find true black pants that fit neither like a tight glove or super baggy.  these look good on and are easy care too. very fast shipping. got here 2 weeks before hand. i was very surprised. the material is so soft. there comfortable and so cute. true to picture!!! i only gave 4 stars though because there a tad bit see through. but it\\'s not drastic. best yoga pants i\\'ve bought online. they fit well & have great colors. will be definitely be buying another pair. fit me perfectly and it\\'s not to short or anything. love it! these are surprisingly nice considering that the cheapo scrubs at walmart were almost double the price of this set and were completely blah.  i like the contrasting trim, it breaks up the solid color and isn\\'t as busy as the full print tops are.  i don\\'t find that the size runs as small as it says, as the xs are still bigger than i need.  all in all, i am completely pleased with my purchase of these scrubs. my wife has several of these pants and loves them. comfortable, easy fit, durable. very good value for the money. these are my new favorite yoga pants! i will definitely order more! i\\'m nearly 6 foot tall so the long pant legs are heaven! she loved them and they look great on her, everyone\\'s happy super comfortable. subdued enough to wear to the office but fashionable enough to get noticed--and complimented!<br />i wore them with lace up stiletto platform calf high boots and they were smashing. i really like the coloring but are definitely a bit smaller than i would like.  i am generally a size 10-12 and should have gone with an xl. i love these pants, but i do not like a flared bottom. wish they were straight leg. the quality and material are great. great buy. incredibly inexpensive, nice quality and fit great!  these are my second pair of authentic yoga pants (curse the grease splatter).  they stretch to fit perfectly, which make them wonderful lounge pants.  if you\\'re goldie locks, they\\'re not too thin and they\\'re not too bulky... just right!  my only wish is that they had a better color selection in my size because i would like another pair in &#34;smoke&#34;. i had to wear these under a very loose fitting costume in case it slipped off. i liked how it fit. stretchy and comfy. i often wear petites (5\\'4&#34;) but these pants are about an inch or two too short. nice. the pants are a good fit for me - so am happy personally. i am 5\\'3\\\\\\\\\" and athletic (110 lbs), and ordered a small. they are comfortable, the material is soft yet appears durable, the stitching and seams feel strong. i have not washed them yet, so don\\'t know how they hold after. they are good for casual every day wear and would also look nice with a stylish top and boots for an evening out.<br />overall, i would say - good quality for the price. would buy again if available. i love the style of this, but after reading reviews, i decided to order one size up from what i normally wear.  it was too big and i\\'m sending it back.  i ordered one in my regular size, so hopefully it fits! i ordered a large when i should have ordered a medium, but i like my sweats baggy, that\\'s why i ordered a large. if you are a female around 5\\' 7&#34; and 130-140 lbs the medium would probably fit about right. like i said i like my sweat pants big and baggy, the large covers most of my feet and i can sinch it up as tight as i need it around the waist. they\\'re super soft, too, which is a plus. i highly recommend these super comfy sweat pants. i bought these for my mom for christmas and she pretty much hasn\\'t taken them off since. they are exceptional, especially at such a low price point. she told me that she will be buying more just because she likes them so much. good to go very good very cool.. i had placed an order for a different brand of training pants and the order was cancelled by the company so i ordered these. they are comfy and great to have when i go somewhere since they are more absorbent than regular underwear. they been washed several times with no signs of wear or tear. love love love these denim jeggings!  i have been buying jeggings that say they look like jeans  they never do. these are exactly what you see on their page! i will buy more! love the price too! arrived very fast good these are very thin pants, but stretchy and comfortable. our snow boarder loved them! we have been using the gdiapers for 2 months now, and all-in-all, i love them!  we primarily use the cloth inserts, switching it up with the disposable liners if we know we are going to be away from home for a long time.  my 13-month-old son is a very heavy wetter (this kid leaks through huggies overnight diapers!), so often i use two of the cloth inserts.  this creates a very bulky diaper, but he doesn\\'t seem to mind - it doesn\\'t hinder him walking, moving around, and his clothes still fit.  they seem to run pretty true to size, my son wears a medium and is 21 lbs.    so far, we have had no leaks with these diapers, if you get leaks - i recommend watching the videos on gdiapers\\' website.  i purchased the 6-pack of g pants, and i am really happy that i did.  occasionally poop will get on the vinyl, and i don\\'t bother wiping it off and reusing like their website suggests - i just grab another cover.  we generally use 3 covers a day, and i always keep a spare in the diaper bag, which leaves me a couple extra just in case i didn\\'t get the laundry going the night before.  i also purchased 18 of the cloth inserts, which is more than plenty.  we\\'ve never come close to running out before i did laundry.   as far as washing the pants and inserts, so far i\\'ve had no trouble.  i just wash them together (with dye & fragrance free detergent) on hot, dry them on regular for 20 minutes, and then hang them up to dry the rest of the way. a couple of times, i tried to just hang the inserts up to dry (without putting them in the dryer first), but they took forever to dry, so this is a good compromise for me (this probably wouldn\\'t be a problem if you live somewhere warm and you can hang them outside, but living in alaska - not so much an option).   also- i recommend using a liner - such as the kushies disposable liners, on top of the inserts if you plan on using the cloth inserts. this has made my life infinitely simpler.  the liners are super thin - sort of similar to a dryer sheet,so pee passes through to the cloth insert, but poop gets stopped.  if my kiddo poops - i just toss out the whole liner and poo with it (or you can flush it), and then i don\\'t have to rinse the cloth liners or anything - just toss straight into the wash.  if my kiddo doesn\\'t poo, the liners can be washed a few times before they are worn out, so they really are worth the extra couple of bucks to use them. it gives my baby enough room for his diaper.i love this monkey pants.100% cotton.it is so comfortable for my active son. i  have lose a few pounds so i will wait a few weeks then i will order another pair. our 6-month old wore this outfit to a wedding and it was super cute.  we washed it first and it shrunk, which made the onesie the perfect size, though the pants were still too long. these are the bomb diggity!  they are so comfortable and classy!  i love. love, love them! these are soft, comfortable, beautiful! fit perfect, i\\'m 5&#34;2 and weigh 140. can\\'t wait to wear. i would also wear these running errands, they are not too sheer. thinner than expected but super comfortable for a light comfy pant, i\\'d recommend this. and a lovely white too, perfect for a hot day. i bought the spongebob earrings for a dear friend. she is over 40 and she just loves spongebob. i told her i was going to buy her some spongebob earrings or make them. well, i searched around first and i found these on amazon.com and the rest is history. i didn\\'t have to make them and that was nice. so thank you for having the spongebob earrings.  sincerely ruth i loved these pants, now they\\'re gone.  if tripp ever starts selling them again i will buy 5 pairs!! they were soft and stretchy, looked great and felt better. fit great and quite comfortable..... love the color. yoga pants, no<br />these pants are heaven comfortble. super soft and light. not see through<br />they lack any definative waist band elastic at all though. so i cant fold them over at the waist and feel secure i will be covered if i am moving around too much<br />i wear the waist band up and they are bliss but they have a lounge feel<br />not a move with you work out or yoga feel<br />i love them but they are not active wear at all love the color and pattern of these comfortable pants. just a little too long, but expected as usually need petite for length. love the material and the feet. a little bigger than expected these are very nice linen pants but you should order a size or even two larger than your waist for a comfortable fit.  i read another review that suggested they were small, so i ordered a size up and even then they\\'re still tight in the waist.  the inseam was also a little longer than it should have been.  it was a great buy for the price; had i not ordered a size up these would not have fit at all. they fit nicely but they are to short for heels or<br />wedges. i like them because i can wear them with<br />flat sandals without hemming them. great looking capri. flattering and a little expensive. but it is worth it. i love the look around the knee. very comfortable fit perfect and hugs your hip nice.  i will greatly recommend this pants to anyone. purchase this one...it is a guaranteed for the perfect fit. these jeans fit exactly to my body shape. i love the destroyed look. i have had these these awhile and i have washed them many times and they are still looking as good as the day i bought them from amazon .these have a lot of give and will stretch to your shape without stretching way out of shape. i was concerned about buying these on line without trying them on. the on line fitting guide helped immensely. i am very happy they fit perfectly and intend to order a few more. its only windbreaker suit not waterproof these are a good basic athletic short option.  single layer of mesh makes them lightweight and comfortable. nice pants love these leggings!  they are a little high waisted but i just fold them over. they are cut on the small side i\\'m a size 4 and they just fit. i prefer the nonelastic waist-band, but they don\\'t seem to carry those. however the pants are as expected and seem to hold up well. this product great! love these. they fit well and wash well. they keep coming back to size and have not stretched out. nice love it! good quality pants, nice and comfy but it\\'s kind  of a little large i would wear these all day every day if i could get away with it. well made and so comfortable! i will buy another pair when mine wear out. very comfortable have searched for petite yoga pants that fit well for a long time.  these feel great, look great, and are the perfect length.  i am 5\\'2&#34; and always have to hem pants but not these.  they are a bit expensive but worth it not to have to hem them.  haven\\'t washed them yet, hope they hold up well. that was the first time that we had ever ordered from amazon and everything went great. my son loved the pants!!! love them! a great improvement over most zip-off pants, the shorts configuration is long enough not to appear out of fashion.  note better color options than the displayed camo.  one star removed for less durable mesh pockets. i love the way these fit me and the waistband looks great. i feel so comfortable in them i sometimes sleep in them or lounge around in them. but i seriously wanted to start working out and wanted some nice workout clothes that i would feel comfortable wearing in a public gym. these are my favorite so far. goes great with the shirt i purchased! these are really cute but run really small! i\\'d probably size up 2 sizes from my normal. i am happy with my purchase. thank you for delivering it on time. good reviews, great price.  ordered these for my daughter, sized correctly, they wash up nicely, we hang dry.  they have a good bit of stretch in them, but are just the right thickness- so as not to look like spandex pants.  she loves them. i got the navy blue pants, it 100 percent rayon it does not have cleaning instructions on it, also the size on the pants say xxl which is fine with me cause i like how they fit, i\\'m about 5\\'5 and 130 pounds. it has a draw string, also has one pocket. not see through, but the fabric is thin so if you bend down people will prob see an underwear line. if you have a cat don\\'t wear these near it. also its made in thailand. mine have not ripped on the first day and i have worn it around the house when i saw that it has arrived, so well made no worries. fits well obviously its suppose to be baggy but not like they diaper pants saggy :) hope this review help :) these pants are great.  lightweight and warm. this is a great suit but i sugest wearing a green or tan shirt underneath caus it is a little spacy at some parts in the arms but overall a great ghillie suit quite comfortable.  a tad loose in the legs, because i don\\'t have body builder legs, but it is nothing to worry about.  my range of motion is fine and i like the stirrups, because it helps keep the form and retain more body heat.  i run (figuratively and literally) cold; i hit the streets around 0330, so it can be a bit chilly, even is socal. very comfortable!! these are great. i use them daily, wash 2-3 times a week and they hold up very well. they dry quickly and do not seem to hold odors. ... but then i run alone.  (perhaps there is a reason? )<br />i was a skeptic as some are less than half $ cost of name brand. after ordering the pants, i got them within a matter of days, which i was pretty pleased with.  these pants are supremely comfortable and will move with you while being flattering at the same time.  my only 2 concerns are that they seem to have lost some of their elasticity, so i would not recommend putting them in the dryer and letting them air-dry instead.  my only other concern is that the top part that folds over tends to bunch up, which leads to a lot of readjusting, but for the price, these are pretty decent pants.  i would definitely recommend these pants if you are looking for some comfortable pants to wear around the house for pretty cheap i ordered one size up. i am a 5\\'3 petite person with thicker legs and more curve to bottom than top (pear). while i usually shop for smalls, i took advice after reading the other reviews and ordered the medium. these fit like a small size would. there is just enough room in the waist area, too. one thing, the color is slightly off in the photos. i ordered the green and the actual color is more of a bright kelly green (like a crayon!). but they fit well and don\\'t have extra material at the ankle. material is nice and smooth and not poly feeling. not that stretchy but better than what i used to wear before. love these great pants wear them all the time  they r long but can be fixed easily great for everyday also i love these colorful pants ! comfortable, light weight. the stirrups keep the legs down so they don\\'t bunch up inside your waders. these were a gift and they look and fit great; quality of the product was exactly as described and i will purchase again.  i would like a few more color options. love them...came on time and the quality is good...the fit is good and very comfortable!!! es sencilla, pero bonita. i got three pairs of yoga pants, three different brands. these are by far my favorites! i love the pockets. i\\'m a little short on booty and they give me a little boost! these pants are a great substitute for standard bdu military pants but have a more true-to-fit feel to them. exactly what i wanted and i love them wonderful dress, exactly like what i expected. excellent fitting, high quality material and stitching and great color. the price is fair. highly recommended. fit better tuck i thought they would. very comfortable very comfortable and fun to wear. i\\'ve had these gym pants for years.  the best!  i\\'ve had others but nothing can compare to otomix.  3\\\\\\\\\" waist band is what makes these pants.  comfortable, strong and keeps your shirt from pulling out.  once you\\'ve owned otomix you can never go back to anything else. this pant tends to run small. it would be best to go up a size . i wear a size 8 in the levi 512 jean. i need a wider leg in a pant. i ordered a medium which was a bit snug and reordered in a large.  i like that the pant runs long. the pants can always be shortened but they can\\'t be made longer. i often use double-click tape to hem my pants. the pants aren\\'t see through and the feel of the material is very nice. customer service was excellent. just wish would give more product detail like width if the pant leg and how long is the rise. great fit, and looks great on.<br />it will be long if you are more petite. i am long legged 5 9 and it fit me perfect.<br />fabric is nice and soft. definitely a keeper. i will get more awesome,so cute!!!! fits as expected.  however, it seems to stretch too much around the hips when wearing pants. i was avoiding wearing maternity pants since i didn\\'t want it to be *obvious* that i was pregnant, but i put these on and started getting compliments on how much weight i\\'ve lost! they really are flattering and comfortable for all-day wear. they fit better after about 2 hours than they do in the store. try them! perfect fit and love the pockets. its not as heavy as it looks, so it\\'s great for lounging around. the color is a true grey. these are super cool for the price. there is a ton of fabric, but the picture is accurate. if you are under 5\\' 7\\\\\\\\\", expect your husband to say you look like you wrapped yourself in a bed sheet. for the buyer looking for something comfy and unique, you have found it. wouldn\\'t do the jumper look if you have a big chest, but my flat-chested friend looks super-chic wearing hers this way. i have size 32 waist and they fit just loose enough for the way i wanted. they are not stretch in the waist at all. i got compliments at the mosque =).  i chose black so that the mesh pockets wouldn\\'t show too much. i spent years looking for these &#34;yo pants&#34; as we called them in quebec and that i fondly remembered from high school. if anyone knows any other brands of these please let me know in the comments.<br /><br />unfortunately i painted one day with these (and got paint on them) so planning on rebuying. also fabric is thin, not in a cheap way, they are very well made, but in a summer way. so if it\\'s super cold out put something under maybe as lots of air goes under! they are also completely opaque (no see through at all). there is a ghast logo on the back but if you don\\'t want i think a small stitch/ seam ripper could easily pop it off. to date i have bought five pairs of these pants. i\\'m 5\\'2&#34;and they fit me perfectly. they are good quality. confortable,  sexy  and  good  quality love these velour pants!  very comfortable,  and soft. in many of the reviews people were saying that these pants run a bit small... i went ahead and got the small size anyway, because i don\\'t like a baggy or loose fit, and they fit me perfect. i am 5\\'3&#34;, 120lbs, 28&#34; waist,  with 35&#34; hips.  i loved the grey one\\'s i got so much that i bought a black pair, and i love those too. shipping was fast. also, do not wash these in hot or even warm water, and let the air dry or they could shrink a bit! these are perfect lounge pants in the sense that they are just appropriate to wear around the house. some of the reviews say they could be dressed up but that is not true! i am a teacher who read that review and bought them because it said that. when i got these i was slightly disappointed because they are clearly a dressed up version of sweatpants. they are really soft, wash well and are true to color and size. i love these pants and the feel of the fabric.  i am 5 feet tall so i have to have about 2 inches removed from the legs.  other than that these are a perfect fit. my son loves them. i will be ordering more. these are super cute...however they aren\\'t as long as in the picture (i\\'m 5&#34;3 and it\\'s probably because i had them sitting too high on my waist).  they fit nice-i normally wear a 6-8 in pants and they actually fit a little loose, but i like that. ok great fit, very comfortable pants. you can wear them anytime and anywhere. very true to size. machine wash and hang to dry. gift recipient is quite pleased with this item for fit and color. item arrived promptly and as described. thanks!. so comfortable....i love these. the color is so pretty and bright. you can wear these with just about any color top. these are very thin material. if you live in a colder climate these would not do well. but the printing and lettering are very good. pants fit great.  the only downfall was that it took almost 2 weeks to get to me. size diff. was the only problem.  i did not have time to return and get a larger size.  if you fall somewhere near the middle of two sizes make sure you go with the larger one.  in my case i would say they ran on the small side according to the fitting chart buy about 2 inches these are also very helpful with potty training, though we wish they were a touch thicker. very happy with my purchase. exactly what i wanted - great product, great price, great fit. i could live in these pants! arrived on time, perfect for my daughter\\'s wookie costume ;-) these are great! so comfy. i love how they fit my curves perfectly! i have 3 pairs, charcoal, deep red (which is more a vibrant red) and olive. lovely! not extremely thick, but i think they\\'re great for cooler autumn days. i brought these shorts to wear under skirts and they were a bit tight when i first tried them on, so i did a bit of tugging on the fabric and it was comfortable to wear. great this is my absolute favorite purchase so far.  i love the material and how it fits.  i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; about 130 and i bought the small and it fits perfect..not too tight at all.  i am buying more colors!  i also ordered it on a faster delivery and rec\\'d it on time for my trip...bonus! cute and fuzzy. i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; and 115 lbs and they fit me pretty good. i had to pull them up past my belly button because i am short and i have a short torso but that is the case with most leggings for me. these pants are very stretchy and comfortable.  the material is a little bit on the thinner side but still durable.  i was slightly concerned they would be too long (i\\'m 5\\'3&#34;) but they\\'re fine for me... maybe a tiny bit shorter and they\\'d be perfect, but overall the size & fit are great. i like alfred dunner elastic waist pants. love the various colors. two pockets are especially important. fit is good, fabric is soft, elastic is of the appropriate stretchiness. consumers should know that the pants are not water-proof, there is only a thin layer of terry cloth for a tiny bit of extra absorption. these would be most appropriate for kids who are almost fully trained and can be relied on to not have too many accidents. i will probably get more as i think these are good as underpants. \\'merica i am a little more than dissappointed that the reviews are not better.  this is not a diaper!  it is a training pant.  my daughter is two and has thick thighs, we got her a medium and they fit great.  the have not leaked or gotten clothing or furniture wet, but she is not comfortable after she pees in them.    i am recommending them to all my new mommy friends. :  by the way - potty training concepts is pretty awesome with exchanging the product to fit your needs if it is not used and still in new package! i absolutely love these pants. i can\\'t wear them enough and they look fantastic. i paired them with a set of repro wwii german wehrmacht suspenders and it\\'s a match made in heaven. it\\'s such a classic look and i\\'ve gotten so many compliments from a wide array of friends and total strangers. even attractive young woman have approached me to tell me how unusual it is to see someone wearing suspender pants and how good they look. i wear them for everything, and i mean everything. they\\'re suitable for yard work, going out with friends, casual fridays, camping, and so on. very versatile, comfortable and tough.<br /><br />update: the reviews that complain about the &#34;flimsy, thin&#34; material are comparing a civilian-made copy to the mil-spec original. unless you\\'re a reenactor you should cut the company some slack. (and even if you aren\\'t, you can\\'t expect nos bolts of the original fabric to still be hanging around---let\\'s be reasonable.) rothco has accomplished a very close approximation of the original.  i have had my pair for nearly a year now and have used them for play, working around the house and i just wore them to work yesterday. (i work at a public market that gets a lot of foot traffic.) i am still getting compliments from customers and these pants have held up far better than i could have expected. i believe i will be able to wring another two or more years of use out of them at the current rate of usage. i love these pants! i wanted to get a size up since ordering online, however there a bit big, i will be ordering more in a smaller size!!! these leggings are great, i love them, are as in the picture, are a bit stuck, work for size s to size m. i have purchased many of these in different colors. i am in love with these pants . okay, i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; and most times i have to worry about my pants being too long. these though, are very nearly too short.  (i don\\'t like my pants right at my ankle or above)they barely brush the ground, even wearing them low on my hips. but...they are slinky, comfy and very dark black. i gave them 4 stars because the tag on the inside says hand wash or dryclean and no heat dry. so you have to hang these to dry, which can take two days.  i think the seller should have made this clear on the description. hopefully they change that soon. i don\\'t do dry cleaning, and hand washing stuff is a pain...(to me) i wear these to lift weights at the gym. people look at me like i am stuck in the 90\\'s but i can live with that. great lounging pants for around the house. super comfortable and they will last you for years fits great. i\\'ve washed already and minimal shrinkage. only somewhat large but not too much these pants are great!  the fit is consistently comfortable, and it retains its shape through out the yoga classes i teach.  i like these pants so much that i purchased several pairs.  they are so affordable, and so well constructed.  i have several pairs of much more expensive yoga pants that can\\'t match these. just what i needed for the perfect gift. any big bang theory fan will love these. fit great and good quality. these are light wieght and not see threw i\\'m a 12 got the large very comfortable and can wear anywhere needed chocolate brown pants for work - which i had a very hard time finding btw.  these pants work ok.  they have washed up nicely (cold water - line-dry) several times.  i have never owned yoga pants before and would have preferred that they did not fit quite so snuggly through lower hips/tush, but the material is soft, thinner and has a lot of give, so the size works for me - i am normally an xl or 1x.  the pants look casual, are very comfortable and feel more like pajama bottoms.... following the advice of other reviews, i ordered a medium even though i wanted them loose to sleep/lounge in and would normally have ordered a large.  that size is perfect.....they do run big.  i can\\'t really tell any difference in these and some dkny ones i paid over $50 for. great lounge pants and have used for yoga! super comfy and don\\'t shrink in the dryer :) one of my favorites! the fabric has a strong chemical odor out of the package.  recommend washing 3-4 times to eliminate the odor before wearing. love these pants! so comfortable! ordering more in other colors. i\\'m usually a small/medium, but i ordered large because i don\\'t like skin tight. they are perfectly snug, i\\'m throwing away all my uncomfortable jeans now! i do wish it came in a basic denim color too, though. fit my 30 inch waist very nicely. medium means medium. very little shrinkage if any after two washing. buy if your looking for quality. drawstring is perfect, which can not be said for some of the other sweats i\\'ve purchased. these leggings came just as pictured. they are one size fits all, and although they fit my 5\\'2&#34;, 110lb frame, they there a tad bit loose in the front and back of the thighs. leggings should be tight fitting, so this felt a little odd. i haven\\'t worn them yet because i haven\\'t found a top that would help hide the odd fit. good fit these pants are great.  sizing is accurate.  well made and very comfortable.  price very reasonable.  they are even better than anticipated. the fit was great. they are very soft and comfortable. i will recommend them to a friend. i\\'m very glad i found them. a little small, but are wonderfully soft. wash very well. one of our favorite brands!!! pretty long for an average height female. this is the best purchase i have ever made online, very soft and durable with hudge pockets love them i bought it for a gif and my sister in law love it so when my honey first bought these, i thought they were cute but oddly shaped. our twins were born and being a little smaller than singletons, they fit a bit big but... they were adorable on them. the fit was baggy, sure, but they looked very comfy and they stayed snuggly warm them. they were soft and laundered easily in the washing machine. also, the odd shape actually came in handy for diaper changes.<br /><br />side note: my sister still shows her co-worker the pics of them in those pants (a year and a half later) to cheer her up when they are having a stressful work day. they use, &#34;babies in hammer pants&#34; as their mantra and the picture to calm them w baby cuteness. great pants! wear these on & off duty. very functional & very comfortable. wish i could find certain colors a little easier, though. the reason i gave these 5 stars is because these fit as i expected perfectly i bought one pair and they fit perfectly too so i decided to order again so i can wear one in summer and fall and black in winter and spring. ill definitely buy more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i\\'ve ordered a few pairs of these on 2 different occasions. they won\\'t last forever if your wear them often but they are cute cheap and comfortable. i\\'m 5\\'8 170 and size l fit me perfect, they are nice and long. ok very nice pants, nice fit and great fabric! very good diaper for the price! seriously i thought i was going to get a flimsy piece of fabric but it was much better quality than i would of ever expected. on the smallest rise and snaps this could definitly fit a nb baby. my only complain about the seller is i wish they would give a shipping discount when you want to order large quantities bc i would love to get many more of these but not willing to pay $100+ in shipping when the sales price is only .01 i was so nervous about the fit if these pants but when they arrived and i tried them on, they fit sooo good.  they curve my body just right and the length is great. im 5\\'7&#34; and i weigh over 160 lbs. i ordered the large in matt black. im so glad i ordered them and the fabric is great, they dont feel like plastic and the inside is soft. for the price i paid i would have expected a cheaper looking pant but they exceeded my expectations. i highly recommend them and if you are hesitant in getting them, dont eecond guess yourself and order them. you will be so happy you did. i hope this helps anyone who reads this... shipped very quickly! i love this vendor &#60;3 i saw in the reviews for the ahhh real monsters pants that this line runs small, so i ordered this pair big as well and they shrunk up exactly to my size. i love them. such vibrant colors and very comfortable material! the only thing missing is pockets. these pants really fit well and are comfortable. the simple lines and absence of any side stripe or logos make them look good with any top you choose to wear. this fit my plus sized body just fine for a 60\\'s party.  it was so comfortable i continue to use it as pajamas.  company was out of stock for the original one that i ordered and they went out of their way to contact me regarding substituting a replacement color that was just as fun. i love these pants, i own 4 pair of them. the colors are awesome and they fit perfectly. i definatly recomend these pants, they are super comfortable also! super cute!  finding leggings that are true to size for a 4\\'11\\\\\\\\\" girl is hard, and of course these are more like ankle length on my frame. however, they are comfortable and fit great.  the waist sits low, more like on the hips as a low rise, but still comfortable.  truly has that wet painted on look like the add suggests.  lots of compliments on these!  looks hot with a pair of stiletto heels!  put them on an get your dance on! be sure to hand wash and hang dry these though, or you will loose that liquid look. otherwise a great product at a better price. these pants fit absolutely perfectly on me, and are exactly what i wanted, and more. the only problem i had was having to hem it a bit, but in all i was very pleased with this product! they are a little bigger than i expected and slightly too long but they\\'re very comfy and lightweight. great quality. love these things. got a few of these but i love that these are footless. the tears are nice and odd. great fit. comfy. not too thick so they can be worn in all seasons. these pants are really nice with the tummy hugger. the straight leg is better looking than the narrow leg. great product. item fit as it should these pants are highly versatile--the material is great for all seasons.  they are soft and very comfortable and fit just slightly below the waist (but not too low). there\\'s only one downfall for me, i prefer a straight leg versus a boot-cut in an athletic pant. i worked as a server and could only wear black.  these pants were flexible and fit very well.  held up longer than most! got this for my boyfriend an he loves it. be careful with the sizes xl fits like a medium . so i made sure i checked the size chart an measure him before i bought it. it also took long to ship but great product. to long very soft, comfortable, the perfect lounge pant - recommend buying it at least one size larger for the perfect fit. i highly recommend these sweats. they\\'re so comfortable and warm. i love dancing in them and honestly even sleeping in them. perfect. works great at the gym. very good for workouts and fit great. they are light weight and not too hot to wear in warm areas. exactly what i  was looking, great quality linen.  of course i wish prices were a little lower. i absolutely love these for my baby boy. he constantly kicks socks off and risks my dog chewing up those socks. these are the perfect solution!! these pants are great!  they are super comfy for yoga, lounging, or out and about.  nice material and have washed well. i purchased two pair and love how comfortable they are. they come very long but are easy to just cut to fit. i would buy more. i would love to order this item in a plus size! please consider adding the 1-3x to your sizing. i think it would be a bog hit! these are really really really cute and super comfy! i only gave 4 stars because these are slightly sheer and i had planned on wearing them to work. also, for those gals who are vertically challenged such as myself, i am 5\\'1 and these are 2-3&#34; too long. i am hoping they might shrink up after being washed. the print is very pretty and they have a soft cotton feel to them. nice stretch and good construction. for the harbor bay navy twill pants 2xl, the fit is very similar to the harbor bay &#34;beach pants&#34;.  the fabric seems a little softer than the beach pants, and my first impression is they\\'re very comfortable.  the color is darker than in the photo.  like the beach pants, the pockets are large enough to put things in, and there is a good amount of stretch in the waistband.  (but this has a button and zipper, while the beach pants have a drawstring.)<br /><br />i haven\\'t yet tried the other colors of twill pants.<br /><br />be warned, the elastic waist denim jeans have a very different fit (in spite of being the same 2xl size), and are tighter in the waist than the twill pants 2xl.  (for me this didn\\'t work, but obviously it depends on the person.) love them perfect!!! my name is may.  i ordered the yoga pants through my husband\\'s account.  i like them. i really like the medium weight fabric, which makes the pants fluid. it was a little long for me because i am 5\\'2\\', \\'so i had to have them altered. they worked wonders, and my grandson was potty trained within a week!! these are soft and nicely made.  i am a size 8 and the large fit perfectly, so well i have already purchased another pair of these pants. comfortable fit ok the product is worth way more then the $13.00 it cost me!  the scrubs were thick and fit perfectly. the quality brought back memories of the way products were made in the past. excellent! i\\'m on the tall side (5\\'10), and these still worked for me. they hit me just below the calf, and i\\'m okay with the look. baggy comfy fit and perfect for my 80s party! i am tall and i love being in shape, i have spent many a saturday afternoon searching for the right pants that would fit my long legs. out of frustration i turned to amazon and found these pants. i got just one pair to be sure i would like them. i love them and of coarse now that i want more there are no more in my size. love the quality of alfred dunner clothes. nice! just like the picture shows! extremely comfortable and stylish. these are a great pair of goucho\\'s and will be wearing them often we brought our daughter home from the hospital in this outfit. i loved it! it is super soft, which i knew from seeing it in a store and was the main reason i chose it. the fabric is lightweight, and i have a feeling it can keep a baby warm (like silk long underwear) or cool, as needed. the fabric is pretty stretchy, making it easy to put on, and we got good use out of it even when our baby was on to the next size in other brands. the only downside might be that it has a bunch of buttons at verious places to keep the top closed and in place - could be complicated unless you\\'re used to it. i bought these for school uniform pants for my daughter in her size. i started to go up to the next size after reading other reviews about these running small, but decided not to. wish i had of now. although i think the style is cute, she wasn\\'t as fond of the them. needing to return and find something else. lightweight and waterproof producto de muy buena calidad y terminacion espero que cuando me toque usarlo en su momento me brinde la proteccion adecuada these pants are definitely military grade, heavyweight and durable. the pants run big so i have to tailor it to my size. other than that, i really like them. they fit fine.  cheap and the elastic band in the waist keeps coiling up.  there\\'s  a small hole in the pants leg. you pay for what you get. bought these almost a year ago because we thought our daughter was ready to use the potty at 2. hmmm.....no. then summer hit... she was constipated, out n about often....oh yeah and shes a 2 year old diva. so we wait till d-day. today was day one and these held up great! theres some leakage, but consider these are cotton and not that plasticity stuff. fyi my kid wears 5t/ xs now and the 3t fit fantastically my son loves these. they\\'re pretty crazy love these pants. size is as expected. it\\'s a little heavier fabric than other palazzo pants, so i can wear them all year round. i am 5\\'5 and the length is fine, maybe a bit long but nothing i can\\'t work with. felt good, right size, comfortable hey when i say these are the best ever i promise you you can not be disappointed i loved them and love them as they say these suckers do something to your butt, i have big butt but law these made it rounder succulant shapely, i was screaming omg i love these, i want all of them. so that\\'s what i did hahahhaah, thanks. first, although these are one of the less baggy-style pants in the ghast line, these pants are designed to be very baggy. the bagginess allows for greater mobility in the legs as compared to, say, a regular pair of jeans. this is why they\\'ve been popular for quite some time to wear to electronic music events to dance in. 22&#34; refers to the cuff size of the pants and they don\\'t flare, so they\\'re 22&#34; all the way up each leg. if you\\'re looking for a regular sized pair of pants for day-to-day use, these probably aren\\'t what you\\'re looking for.<br /><br />that being said, these pants are great for music events, whether dancing or just hanging out, or anywhere you\\'d like to be extra comfortable! they remind me of baggy pajama bottoms but made to wear out somewhere. i waited awhile to buy these because i was hesitant as to whether they were what i was looking for, but they definitely are! at around 5\\'9&#34;-5\\'10&#34; and a 36-38 waist, a large fits me perfectly. no belt loops on the waist, only a drawstring and also a basic zipper and sewn on button. there are also drawstrings at each ankle cuff so you can secure the pants to your ankle to prevent walking on them. i thought this was going to make them feel like parachute pants but they\\'re nowhere near that baggy. if you\\'d like to roll them up and wear them as shorts there are tie offs inside the cargo pockets at the knee, and those cargo pockets also double as large and very deep pockets that you can fit 2 regular sized water bottles in each. they have fairly shallow pockets at the hip but there\\'s flaps secured with buttons (sewn on buttons not snaps) to make sure that everything in your pocket stays in your pocket, as well as one right back pocket with the same flap and button. you\\'ll have no problem fitting the basics into them (keys, wallet, cell phone, cigarettes, lighter, etc). there\\'s also short pieces of fabric with buttons on the inside of the waist that you could attach suspenders to if you wanted to.<br /><br />the pants are made of a thin material that breathes and also dries very quickly. if you\\'re outside and its cold and windy, you might get a bit chilly in these due to the thin breathable material. i tend to run hot anyway, and this has never bothered me outdoor, and surely not indoor. after taking them to edc and around 5-10 different events, i love these things! i couldn\\'t imagine going back to wearing jeans to a show! i highly recommend these to any concert goer and they come in lots of different colors! worn this brand and size for several years reliable fit and appearance. not dress slacks but fine for casual office wear. these yoga pants fit perfectly, are well made, and the material is really soft. i couldn\\'t believe how nice they were when they arrived.  i\\'m back to buy another pair! comfy and roomy i bought these pants a while back and they still look as good as new. they are very durable. i did however have to run them through the wash several times to lessen the stiffness. perfect i have discovered that the secret to maternity clothes and my mood in general is cozy, well fitted pants.  they have to sit just right or my little guy in there kicks like mad!  so these pants are perfect! nice material- work fine for daycare. not heavy enough for winter but good day to day use. bought several pair my 5 month old wears these all the time!! sooo soft & comfortable! love them! legs a little blousey,but waist was perfect.light weight and wind and waterproof as advertised i really like these pants, but the inseam seems longer than my other ones of the same size. i haven\\'t measured them yet, but they are maybe an inch longer than my other pants. i do like the fit otherwise. these pants are of excellent quality, the wash effect is fun & the fit is great...and long enough for my 34&#34; inseam :-)  worth the money! the pants were a christmas gift for a friend of mine who is a new zumba enthusiast. the package arrived prior to the expected date and in good condition. the pants are very lightweight and seem to be well made.  they do run a little small in the waist and rise and i wish i had paid more attention to the other reviews before purchasing or i would have sized up.  i ended up returning the pants for a larger size.  even though the exchange/return process was a little bumpy, the seller was very responsive and shipped out my replacement pair of pants very quickly. i would purchase from this seller again. these seem well made, feel good.<br /><br />size-wize, i\\'m 5\\'10, 150 pounds and ordered a medium. i think they feel borderline too small and my wife says they look too small. will probably re-order a size large. these training pants are excellent quality and work well. i only wish they were a little larger in size. my son is a very tall and a big kid child for 4 years old (37 inches and 56 lbs.)and he\\'s grown out of these pants over the past year... i wish we\\'d found these 2 years ago!! outstanding quality and function! i highly recommend these training pants. great for overnight use to help any accidents in the middle of the night on the way to the bathroom. as stated by the seller, not intended for full bladder emptying... but, they really do work almost as well as a diaper in that case (either way my son wets through his clothes... but in these training pants at least he\\'s comfortable & knows he\\'s wet). the cloth is soft and moves with my son... i love these pants and so does he. wonderful transition from bulky diapers and helps transition to underwear. love love love these training pants!! fit perfectly..the material was more of a swimsuit kind however but it still looks like in the picture  and arrived on time shorts are super cute and comfortable. delivery was super fast. thank you! i love everything about this jeans the design i really recommend this product it worth the money i paid for it and it fits my body perfect my buddy looks nice the way i want to look thank you amazon i am 6 ft and 185 pds. i got the large and it fits perfectly. went out to run in them on a 55 degree day and spitting rain. the pants were comfortable and kept me warm the whole time. just got these pants, they are extremely comfortable! i got 1/2 a dozen compliments the first time i wore them. i\\'m 5\\'9 and medium hit the floor in flats. 4 stars because at the end of the day the waist was a bit stretched out had to keep pulling them up. happy with my purchase of petite pants.  about me 5\\'3&#34; and a size 14ish  happy that the pants don\\'t hug my butt and belly funny like some workout pants.  these are super comfy and work well for yoga and lounging. sooooo comfortable. i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; and weigh 90 pounds and these fit perfectly. they are a bit high water but since i only wear them with boots it doesn\\'t matter. i also really liked that they were lined, makes them really warm and cozy! really nice fit and quality great i like it granddaughter loves these i may update, but so far they are great! they fit perfectly. i was worried because it\\'s hard for me to find pants that fit my bum and hips, but these stretch just right. although they are a bit long, i am short though so nothing new. i like it very much, but as in the recomendations they say to ask for two size more because it was very small i ask like that, at the end it was very big, maybe with 1 size more it would be perfect. even that i like it and the colore is almost the same as in the picture. this feels very comfortable. perfect length and it just feels awesome to wear. a must for any kid military enthusiast. love the pants. however they are too small. i\\'m 5\\'9 140lbs and they are very tight. i contacted the seller and they got back to me right away. was so happy with their customer service. they returned my email within an hour! i am currently in the process of doing a exchange with them. i\\'m so happy with this company. i will definitely re-buy from them in the future. although they didn\\'t quite fit they still get 5 stars from me. its to often that companies suck and have terrible customer service. thank you very nice quality - taking it to germany as a gift - so can\\'t say much else these were wearable in public. i ordered 2 more pair both the others were to thin for public :( they are slightly sheer..very comfortable..a little fragile. i noticed a rip in the seam the first day i wore them. i love this so i will buy more when we need them......just like the review said soft and fit just right. very nice pants and love the fit tribal has always been a very nice brand to own very nice love it both the top and bottom fit nicely, little bit on the small side. washed once, wrinkle resistant and no color fading observed. these are my favorite pj\\'s!!!! soft.  i got a small.  i think these are mens.  they are so cool and i wish oh how i wish the angels could glow in the dark!!!! they did not have them in my husband\\'s size unfortunately, but keep me posted because i will buy more! im 5\\'7 and they were still very long but they fit as i expected everwhere else and look great on!! fits well. the waistband is flattering. because it is wide, there is no muffin top. get compliments on it when i wear it. an easy way to sexy up an outfit or a top, looks great with heels or boots. great yoga pants- they are thin and airy. you also get what you pay for- mine lasted several months before getting holes at the butt-seam. still pretty good for the price! nan cute cat heads, without baby pink everywhere. not too short (fits same as known inseam flannel pjs at 31&#34;). the polyester fleece has endured with no pilling yet, after 20 washes. ribbon tie is long enough not to get lost in the wash, staying in place in waistband so far. these, dogs and paw fleece and flannel pants all winter long! the material is so soft and comfortable. i love the feel of it on my skin. i gave it 4 star because the material is kinda thin and unlined. exelent ordering some clothes on line can be risky due to size and spec variations . this order gave me enough confidence to try it again . fits good just a little too long. but then again i am a little short. they fit good every where else. oh how i love these!!!!!! i just wish i had found them sooner! fits great, high quality, long lasting rough pants. they feel great in all type of weather. i will get more in other colors. i bought these pants because the reviews were good and i thought the heather chocolate color was an cool alternative to the black and grey leggings everywhere. i was not disappointed! the wide waist band is easily worn higher for tummy/muffin top control, or you can fold it over, or under your belly button like the picture shows. even if i wear them up a little higher the crotch doesn\\'t ride up or \\\\\\\\\"show too much.\\\\\\\\\" they also are not sheer- even if you bend over they are opaque. they do not wick away sweat for heavy workouts.  but for the price - these are everything i wanted! these are not only really comfortable but can be combined with a sweater or blouse and worn day or night.  love the color! this is perfect...one of my favorite purchases ever.  the material is nice, and it fits really well and very comfortable.  my favorite piece!! these are so comfortable!  great as a beach cover up.  these are roomy and fit just as i expected.  i have washed several times and they haven\\'t faded or lost their elasticity.  i am very happy with this purchase and will be ordering another pair. it is comfortable. beautiful and fits perfect the pants are a nice material and well made. they are very confy. i wanted some everyday yoga pants to wear at the end of my pregnancy when i was huge and very misserable. these were perfect. they hug my curvy thighs perfect that why i pick my rating they are perfect i have to buy these in black super looking pants! i had to cut them off a little bit, but i love them. they fit to size. super comfy, i pretty much live in yoga pants- i would definitely purchase again. great shape. what i expected.although somewhat slimmer. i love it... the leggings are wonderful. but definitely order larger than your normal size. i am usually a size 4 and ordered large, which fits perfectly. a medium would probably have fit as well but i don\\'t like it when it is too snug. the legs are long enough to cover my ankles. the color and the pattern are just like in the picture. the material is super stretchy, so these pants are super comfortable. nevertheless, unlike other leggings, they look more like real pants due to the pockets and pattern. the front pockets are fake but the back pockets are real. one of the best things about these pants: no camel toe. i highly recommend these leggings. a+ they are nice quality, but too big for a baby under 12 pounds or maybe 22 or 23 inches long.  i marked them down from five stars because 0-2 months is probably not accurate for their size.  we have to fold them over a couple of times at the waist for our 10 lb, 2 month old, but they will be wearable for awhile. lightweight, comfortable, somewhat discreet, and fairly waterproof. a good choice when compared to the higher priced options. not perfectly waterproof like a good pair of plastic panties, but much cooler to wear under clothes. these are made from an extremely soft and flexible material.  they are comfortable for wearing aroungd the house, and excellent for yoga.  will be ordering more! these are very soft and will be nice to dance in.  i was not expecting the red stitching around the \\\\\\\\\"skirt\\\\\\\\\" part of the pants, but that\\'s ok.  i\\'d have preferred they were *all black,* but no biggie.  very cute pants. if you like the cargo shorts, then you\\'ll also love this. perfect casual pants!!! excellent fit. i normally wear a medium in pants, but i ordered a large for these, and they fit perfectly. little large. feels good. good fit exactly what i expected. these are very nice. bought one for each teen.  they love them. when i opened this out of the packaging, i was surprised at how small it looked when i ordered a medium.  i thought for sure that there was no way i was going to get it past my ankles‚Ä¶but lo and behold, i put them on and they went right on.  the high waist detail cinches you in and gives you the appearance of a smaller waist and very smoothing also.  i bought it in the cobalt blue as well and love it. excellent fit and material feels great! i love this outfit! it might run small to some. my baby is 1month and i got 3-6mo and it seems to fit her jus right. we will have to see if she makes it to 6mo in it. so go up a size if your baby is average in weight and height. the dress is beautiful and flows like a dream... shipping was fast thank you great deals for you!.. i will be flowing on my birthday lol.... i love these. they are very comfortable, i got a large and i am 5\\'4 and about 170. they are a little snug but they don\\'t give me a muffin top or anything. i love them.  and i will buy more. they are a little long but i do not mind. perfect my son loved it love them!!! wow- can\\'t believe what a deal these pants are! $8.00 for a very nice fitting, comfortable, great quality pair of cargo pants!! size runs true and although they say \\'skinny fit\\' they are not tight, just more straight legged which is what i wanted. came back and bought a second pair in navy because they are that great!! thank you amazon!!! love this outfit. lt looks great on my son. awesome luv them couldn\\'t wait to receive my leggings..they were delivered in a timely fashion and packaged well. these leggings met beyond my expections..being that, i am 5\\'10 i read the reviews and am happy to report that the critics were right!!! like i have stated i am tall and these pants fit right at my ankles...i can\\'t believe it..it\\'s like they comform to your body..very very nice fabric love them...will be ordering more colors.<br />thanks again another satisfied customer. i was very pleased with this purchase, and would happily order them again! they have some nice detailing, and are nice and long. though they were advertised as being &#34;baggy fit&#34;, i still ordered a large, because they were coming from so far away, and i thought i had a better chance of them fitting than the medium. i normally wear a 10, and the pants fit beautifully! the waist is perfect, and the hip area is comfortably and stylishly fit. i would recomment these for all but summer. good buy with about 2 week delivery, ;though i believe the company had said it would take longer. what a nice surprise to get something early!!! buy these, they are well worth the price! these pants are so soft & comfortable! i wear them all the time! the material is so super soft! plus the support of the mumband is great!<br />-mystie good these pants were wonderful for yoga because they are loose but you don\\'t step on the flared legs like regular pants.  now i can do my yoga in comfort. somewhat smaller than i remember them. had them converted to shorts. i will get a second pair in a large. 33inch waist. received in a timely manner.<br />pants are extremely comfortable and they wash & wear well. sizing was surprisingly &#34;just right&#34; and not binding any where. very stylish and comfortable. the picture is pretty accurate for my 32 inch inseam. they are not too tight and wash easily. just right for the gym. love, love, love these pants, comfortable and so soft.  will buy more for sure. one of the best pants i\\'ve bough in a long time. i love these. i did buy one size bigger just incase i gained more weight but even though it has a size recommendation chart which i\\'m a 33 the large (35-40?)still adjusted well with the 2 pull tabs on the side. haven\\'t had any buttons fall off yet even though its been though a wash already and has been worn daily for the past 2 weeks. still comfortable with or without a web belt. will definitely buy another from army universe. arrived quickly. these paints are very nice i love the fit and they are butt lifting i really saw the diffrants i totaly reccomend these pants my husband ordered two pairs of these pants and he loves them.  they are comfortable, they wrap and tie very well, and they look way cool.  the kanji is beautifully written and the material is not too heavy and not too lightweight.  they wash well.  by the way, one leg is supposed to be larger than the other.  awesome pants! very good quality/outatandding fit/ looks very cool. fit great. warm and cozy. i love these pants! they feel great, material is thick enough i feel comfortable when i bend over that someone cannot see through these. i am 5\\'7 160lbs & ordered a medium. i got them as a gift for my sister and she loved them and has already worn them.  they fit her just right. it\\'s a cute pair of loose pants. haven\\'t washed them yet so i\\'m not sure yet about quality but so far here comfortable and cute. true to size great tights for the price- fit well and seem durable. print was insane. loved it! lots of compliments at an animal party. stop shopping and buy these already...by far the best pants for the money love these pants! so soft and comfortable! these patriots lounge pants were a christmas gift and the recipient was very pleased to receive them. love it my teenager daughter loves to look neat, and she kept complaining about her jeggings/leggings not staying neatly in her boots. i<br /><br />told her to do what we did in the 80\\'s- wear stirrups! of course this millennium baby knew nothing about a stirrup, but once i<br /><br />ordered it for her she fell in love. they are really soft and oh so comfortable. see, sometimes what\\'s old is new again. beautiful color! i could of used a medium. waist is very large and loose. i will have to take in the waist on the sewing machine. i bought them for my uncle rex and his new teakwondo studio. he loves them! love, love these pants. look and feel great! we purchased this for our son who is 3.  this is not a kids belt and thus we have to extend it out to a 36&#34; or so and wrap around him twice.  but he could care less!!!<br /><br />he loved the characters.<br /><br />the belt and buckle seem to be of the top quality, as well as the craftsmanship is flawless to the the eye.<br /><br />great purchase and we will be looking for more in the future.<br /><br />this vendor as well was a quick ship and these items were to us much quicker then expected! i absolutely love these! they are so comfy and by far my favorite pair of leggings to run in! will definitely be ordering more colors! the bottom cuff thing idea is not effective and may trip you baby when they stand up in the crib! these are good cargo pants.  they look good and i also like the velcro on the pockets instead of buttons.  easier to open and close and i won\\'t have to replace buttons in the future.  i expect to buy another pair in a different color. love these pants, but remember to dry clean or hang to dry after a gentle wash. they look fabulous on and are so comfy! a+++service and seller :) great item, fast shipping. only thing is.... i wish i would have been able to choose a color, just had to take what was sent but overall great item and great transaction. fabric is easy to care for and moves with the body, and i love the color i wear 38&#34; dress pants and 36&#34; relaxed fit jeans/38&#34; regular jeans. the large is supposed to fit up to a 39&#34; waste. the 4 pair i purchased seem to be closer to a 37&#34; and are a little tight. the pants are of great quality and i would definitely purchasing them again, only in a larger size. they look d... good on me ! thank you. these pants are soooo comfortable! they\\'re thin and lightweight but not see through, and the fabric is soft and stretchy. however they are tight on the calves, so if yours are large you\\'ll want to consider that, but the top area is bigger. i got a pair in black and dark grey- the dark grey has a different feel to them. they\\'re not as soft and stretchy. one problem is that the waistband flips and bends inside of the fabric after washing/drying which can make it uncomfortable or unsightly under clothes. pilling is also an issue with both pairs, but overall i\\'m happy with them. especially for the price seeing as other pants i\\'ve seen like this cost around $20. these are a much nicer pair of sweats- i don\\'t feel awkward about wearing them in public. most leggings on me are way too long , but not these! ordered 2 more pairs for work!! so comfy and cute (: love them! thank you! great fit good look. comfy snug fit. do tend to stretch out alittle through out the day and become looser though. love these pants. the last ones that i bought from the store were too short. this time, i am thrilled. been wearing these for years. ...they run small! order one size up from normal and you will be very happy. i\\'m 5\\'9&#34; and most pants, men\\'s included, are too short if not just right...these are extremely long on me. probably an extra 3 or 4 inches too long. i still love them! everything else fits perfectly! i wouldn\\'t wear them to run in, but they\\'re great for showing off with. the waist sits low enough in the back that is constantly feels like the need to be pulled up if you\\'re not used to that. the quality is also below what you\\'d expect from true running pants, but if you\\'re just wearing it around the house to tease a significant other, they\\'re great. very comforatable very sexy extremely sheer! these pants are so comfortable i could die in them! they\\'re great for, ahem, when the painters are in, or just when you don\\'t feel like dressing up. but they still look totally acceptable in public. i did have a few small issues with them, though. they fade pretty quickly (after several washes you\\'ll start to notice it). and they do stain easily, so be careful with your coffee! however, for the price, they\\'re totally worth it, and i will definitely be ordering more in the future. adorable  my daughter and i love the look love it the quality and fit are beyond what i expected.  another two inches on the legs would not hurt but there is no problem at all.  i am 70 inches tall and weigh 165 and the medium is perfect.  the pouch fits my package comfortably.  these runners will never be on the shelves of walmart.  they are just too good.  i will be buying a couple more pairs for the winter.  amazon prime came through again.  from the time i ordered them and to the time they were at the door was less than two days.  nice bought these for my wife for her birthday and she loves them. these pants are lightweight,durable, and comfortable. my son is 7 and he hiked up (and down) mt. washington in them. i have great fun with these pants they\\'re comfortable and very trendy people seem to like them i wear them quite often i love the fabric.  issue with the fit is the waist is quite tight and the legs are long for how small the waist is.  and my baby girl is very petite! really comfy pants but the length is for someone who is 7 feet tall..i had to cut some length off the legs but the material cut easy and didn\\'t fray..judge you by your size...i did im wearing them now! i bought this for my daughter to wear under a jumper dress. it is super soft, and matches her jumper perfectly. the color is dark green (a little darker than the picture, in my opinion) - but the size seems to run small. i bought her an 18m, and it fits tight. the majority of her 18m clothes fit her big, so if i were ordering again i would order a bigger size just to give her some growing room. i do like the soft, stretchy fabric that it\\'s made out of. it fit my baby very nice. i would definately recommend and purchase some more of these cute, functional, true to size. purchased and dancewear for my daughter and she loves them! we will definitely buy them again in every color! even though they run somewhat large-still very cozy was a big fan i bought 2 more pairs.  they do run long in length  as well, but since they weren\\'t pricey i cut bottom w scissors and they worked and fit just fine. perfect fit, good quality product. i have 3 pairs of these and they last a long time. great fit, not see though and not a bad price. i bought these alfred dunner slacks for my mother. the sizing was correct. the fabric was exactly what i thought it would be. the color was a nice light brown. my mother wears too much black and i wanted to surprise her with an outfit that she could be comfortable in and look good. my mother was delighted to get these slacks with a lovely unique red sweater. the slacks are easy to care for and retain their nice look. i would recommend these slacks for comfort and style! just want i wanted i am rather picky about my yoga pants, but these are absolutely wonderful. they do really hug your curves. they are a little long for me but i am just a little taller than 5 ft. the material is super soft and breathable and they wash like a dream! they run a little long.  i haven\\'t been able to wear them because they are so long.  the quality seems good. sympli style of this pant is great. truly a pure pant! very nice but know that they are relatively thin so don\\'t wear them in a cold room i\\'m about 5\\'10&quot; and have a really hard time finding workout pants that are long enough.  these are the best ever.  just the right length and they are so comfortable! if you are looking for warm and comfortable, these are for you.  purchased a pair through bauer\\'s site and after wearing went back to order a second pair. sold out.  amazon is sold out in my size also.  zero shrinkage. fit well with ample pockets. i wear for walking and golfing.  comfortable waist. these help in potty training so much! when kids do have an accident in normal underwear, everything pretty much hits the floor. with these, they will soak up the majority of the urine, that sometimes their pants may even be saved fun gift i received them on time. i ordered them for my 16 year old son he\\'s thin and tall. so, i got a medium tall. after he put he\\'s boots on their perfect with some to spare. he said their very warm. we haven\\'t tried them in the the snow yet. he also liked the style of them. their not stiff. adorable pants and fast shipping. thanks! size is right, very warm and soft.  a very comfy pajama bottom or to lounge around in.  i will buy more. i love that they are long enough to fit my 5\\'11 frame i bought these because they were cheap but it turned out my wife loved them and they looked great on her. the pants make me feel so sexy but i got to worn you that its warm good fit ,color was different than illustrated but still a good purchase. got these for my thin and tall 11 year old.  fits perfectly and washes well. they look so cute on her and she says they are super comfy.  she wears them all the time. at first they didn\\'t look like they were going to fit.(they look tiny), however they do. they looked great, felt comfortable. my new favorite. cute pants, well made.  wash well and delivered quickly.  happy with the purchase. these are so comfortable. i really like the way they fit.'"

For example, that could predict whether a clothing item will classified as woman or man, should be marketed to woman or man, or if a specific gender will like or dislike a new product based on the training data of previous reviews. Prediction would be the regression side of the SVM, and then classifying woman/man, like or dislike would be the classification side. This is the basis of recommendation models. We could continue to train the model based on whether the client buys the recommended item and on their latest reviews.\n",

After the data has been classified by sentiment analysis, we can use logistic regression. We can convert text into numerical value, positive or negative, then use that as 0/1 value as predictor. The model will take the numerically expressed features as input, and the output is predicted binary sentiment.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Genderless Pants also have more High Ratings and less Low Ratings than BOTH Men's Pants and Women's pants, so we can continue to find features in the Amazon Reviews to expand this product as a category for NonBinary customers."
