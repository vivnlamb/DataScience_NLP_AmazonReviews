              "'these pants are super cute. i\\'m a little hippy, normally a size 6 or 8,  and think i need a large which i haven\\'t received yet. they will need to be hemmed, hopefully not too much or the design will be cut short. love them! so comfy and long. i ordered a size smaller than i normally would and they fit perfect. finally a pair of lounge pants that are long enough! ( i am 5\\'\\'7&#34; with a 33&#34; inseam.) i am extremely happy with the fit and after a couple of washing they still fit great and are holding up well. i read other reviews where people have stated they were very thin, i don\\'t find that to be true. they may be thin but definitely not too thin or see through. love them! cute. soft, inexpensive, fast shipping.<br />5 stars love the amazing fit! very nice pants! plan to order more of these very well made pants! perfect fit. arrived on time. great material. was not disappointed at all. would recommend to anyone. too small, had to return the item.  but, the return went well these are my new favorite pants!!!!!!!  i am going to buy more because i love them!  i wore them for easter, and then all day and in the car for four hours.  they can easily be dressed up or worn as a beach cover up.  some people complained about the length, but at 5\\'7 i found the length just right. i received this product at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review. opinion stated is 100% mine!<br /><br />these fit as expected and were actually much higher quality than i was expecting. they are great for wearing any time of the day or night. i have worn these under a sweater with boots. and with a tank top while relaxing at home. very versatile piece of clothing. this was my first time trying ponte pants and i now can say i\\'m a fan! these pants are unique and have a nice fit. the colors are not as vibrant as pictured (a little more muted) but the pattern is still nice. i wish the tassel ties in front were just a bit longer. overall though, i\\'m satisfied with it. i was preparing for a total knee replacement in december,  and was looking for something comfortable,  wide leg, and easy to get on and off. saw these,  and although some of the patterns seemed weird for me to wear (i\\'m 59), i bought one of each. love them!!!!! they are very long, or i it could be that i\\'m only 5\\'3\\\\\\\\\", but after hemming, the fit great. got plenty of complements both at the hospital and physical therapy, and three months later am still wearing them.<br /><br />the only thing i would wish for is that dangerousfx makes these in lighter colors for spring/summer. i know they are more a \\\\\\\\\"goth\\\\\\\\\" shop, but i bet they would sell out. nice  summer  pants.  dress them up or down  depending  on  the  top  and  shoes  and you\\'re  set for any occasion . i bought white and beige ones and i wish they had more colors cause i love the thickness of them. mostly for the light colors cause you cant see every bump and bulge thru them...:)<br />:) so cute. i am 5\\'-1&#34; 97 lb and this fits me perfectly. ordered these pants to wear when i jog/run after mine finally bit the dust after 3 years. i hate working out in loose pants, but finding stretchy ones is a struggle because they never stay where you need them to stay(they travel up, the waistband rolls under my workout shirt, weird things happen around the seam areas, etc.). my last pants had that \\'foldover\\' waist, which was great so i looked for that again, and these were the only ones that looked decent.<br /><br />i am incredibly happy with these pants! i\\'m an xl (46&#34;, 37&#34;, 46&#34;) and they fit me perfectly, just the right combination of form hugging without being too tight. they\\'re long, too, unlike most pants which are fitted to the ankle- i\\'m 5\\'6 and they cover my ankles with fabric to spare, but not so much that they bunch around my shoes. best of all, they stay in place throughout my entire workout, no bunching or traveling! plus, they are lightweight and comfortable.<br /><br />i highly recommend these pants to anyone looking for comfy workout clothes. i know i\\'ll be buying another pair in the near future! very light, very nice! came with a spot of something on it? not that noticeable though, was upset they were dirty, but didn\\'t care that much. i just wear them around the house. i absolutely love these pants!!!  i\\'m 5,6  125pnd... they are absolutely perfect! perfect on length. i even put them in the dryer and they are still at a great length. (not high watering)  i even bought a second pair and another for my friend. great fit! i have a small waist with thick thighs and these fit great all over! i would definitely recommend this to others. cute. fit as expected. comfortable. but very wrinkly nicely thx i bought two sets of these. they are are form fitting, so this one being a mesh top i may have wanted a large but i\\'m keeping the medium (i\\'m 5\\'4\\'\\' and 130 lbs). i love these sets though. they look great, feel great to quell out in, and don\\'t show your sweat. i instruct a piyo class and these outfits always keep confident in front of a group. i absolutely love these! is this product new or used?<br />does it come with its original tags?<br />may you upload an image with the rear-view of the pants?<br />sincerest apologies for my numerous questions and any inconvenience. i live in canada, so the final price of this product with shipping is $42. i just want to ensure that if i make this purchase that i am fully satisfied with the choice i made.<br />thank you! this jumpsuit is very elegant and flattering. it fits with a hair to spare!  and, the best part, i don\\'t have to take them up!  i\\'m so thrilled...and i\\'m only 5\\'2&#34; (round and short).  that\\'s okay:  god loves me and my mother understands! they fit well and are very comfortable. also love that they have pockets as so many other yoga/lounge pants do not.  would love the same pants but in a lighter weight fabric for the hot fl summers these are now my wife\\'s favorite pants and she wears them all the time.  light, so will pack well for trips i have several pairs of tp plush pajama pants.  these are all a thicker plush than the typical thin fleece, they are fluffy and soft and breathable and fabulous. i rate them as &#34;somewhat small&#34; even though my pair fit, because i wear an 8-10 ( 8 is a perfect slim fit, 10 is a comfortable fitting bottom) and i bought the lg and it was tight in the waist band, like a size 6 would be, xl and it was a size 8 fit and bought the xxl and it was a size 10 fit - roomy, slightly baggy, comfortable. both are wearable, but it is based on experience that i got a size that fit because i ignore the size charts, which are appallingly wrong, always and consistently wrong, on 99% of the brands.<br /><br />i have loved every pair - although, the one pair of large i bought were barely wearable because they are tight in the waistband - my summer size body can probably wear them more  comfortably when the time comes and since my house is fabulously cold, it wont matter that it is summer. if matching the pattern at the seams is a necessity, these are not the brand for you.  it is important in some clothes - as grandma was a seamstress for us kids and quality was seen as matching seams perfectly - when you can only get a couple of brands of pajamas in this fluffy fleece, at an affordable price, you get what you can.  i would rather have 3 pairs of these, than afford one pair of expensive plush pj pants with matching seams.<br /><br />i recently saw they added matching robes, hopefully it is in the same fluffy fleece - and perhaps tops will be coming down the line someday? those of us who need or love this fleece - not thin fleece - need tops for our pants.  for now, i will sew buttons down the robe if it turns out to be the same fluffy feece. absolutely love them! comfy, funky, affordable. i wear them with a wide belt. they come in only one size, though. huge! but still love them. pretty groovy panzzzz. i only wish the elastic on the waste wasn\\'t so high. i purchased another pair from ellazhu and i was the darling of the ball. they were fun, they were fabulous. so, i know i will have fun with these, too. i just have to use a little more ingenuity with these for the way they fit. i wish they were a little more baggier, longer, and tighter around the ankles. ok, so obviously a whole country of women are looking for these  larger sized pull on stretch jeans along with the 5 pocket style stretch denim....so where is the answer to our questions?  why isn\\'t target selling an item that is in such demand? wife says they are comfy, fit perfect and can be worn at work and when you\\'re at evening outings love love love:) these pants certainly make a statement. nothing bad to say about these and can\\'t wait to wear them:) i plan on buying another pair.. these are so comfy and i wish i had more! will buy again :) love love love this jumpsuit you gotta buy one for yourself! love these and they fit perfect :) arrived in the wrong color. i ordered  black! like the maroon, so decided to keep them. super cute pants! i love the color and they are so comfy!! i\\'m planning on buying more in different colors. dunner has the only petite &#34;short&#34; pants that i never have to hem.  not a &#34;real&#34; jean of course but looks good with a top that hangs out. my body type is a large (14-16) and beings this scrub outfit had some polyester with cotton blend it would fit me.<br /> i was wrong it was a just a little tight, if i ordered the xl(16-18) then they are to loose. i like the ultra soft brand as it is soft and comfortable to wear right from the first wear. i normally wear a size 2p in loft, and the xxs in the scrub pants fit me. so order a size down as these pants tend to be bigger. good price and quality. i am not of indian or asian heritage, but i found this to be a stylish look when paired with the tunic. i like to have my own look and style. hate the cookie cutter look in today\\'s fashion climate. little bigger than expected. good quality. love the pants. good product fit well.  better quality than another pair i ordered from anther seller.  thanks and a hat tip love these so much. a little weary about washing them on anything but delicate due to the print, but i think it\\'s worth it! this pant is so comfortably, and fits true to size. i got a medium and i am a size 7/8 with some booty action, and looking good all over my body! bought them for a new staff member. for the price it\\'s actually quite a value. the quality of the material is great and haven\\'t had any issues with it so far and she\\'s had them for about 3 months now. the colors haven\\'t faded even after several washes. i will definitely be getting more of these once it comes time to replace them. great dress. great dress. and again....great dress. love the fabric. fits great nice weight to the fabric and they look great! i\\'ll be ordering these again! fast shippment too, don\\'t hesitated to order these! love my daughter loved it see look so beautiful in it needed something to wear after abdominal surgery that were comfortable and looked okay, these were just what i needed. arrived quickly, comfortable and well made. thank you. absolutely stunning favorite scrubs order a size or two bigger! other than that high quality product! not good great pants for price. it feelss great to wear and is very comfortable for work and play.  love it it\\'s very nice to wear. nice and soft and veryt cool ehhh... now my favorite pants. i got them in multiple colors and wear them both to the office and out for the evening. they are super comfortable. i read that a few people that found them see-through. that has not been my experience at all. the chevron black beige pants are more beige than they look on my computer but are still very nice. i found that the notations spandex nylon t-shirt in &#34;sand&#34; match them perfectly. so comfy ! i love how soft these pants are! i like them, but i wished they were a little baggier. i got a lot of compliments on them tough, everyone loves the pattern thingy on the side. they are very comfortable and arrived pretty soon. i\\'m very happy with them. love it these are well made trousers, and very cute! they also arrived well ahead of the estimated delivery date. i followed the sizing guide, and found it accurate. buyers should be advised, however, that the &#34;waist&#34; sits at the hips, rather than at the true waist--so measure accordingly. also there are puffy pockets on the rear end, which, combined with the low waist, can give a curvy person a bit of a bubble butt. i like the look, but some people might not. overall, nice pants, good price, and smooth transaction. they look good on me and i have a bottom like the picture but 5\\'11. while i\\'m cycling there\\'s still discomfort when exercising with the shorts. this could be greatly improved and modified for real comfort. wear them, wash them, saves on the jeans around the house its very comfortable, good quality, elegant, and can be wear in any occasions. last time i been in party with night jacket fit a little to large the expected but it does do the job i love it oh my god beautiful will defiantly order again favorite, most comfortable fit!! great pants for anything you may want to do. they can go anywhere. love my pants! feel great i love wearing them the waist is a little too high and causes it to slide or roll. comfy and casual. very bohemian. as soon as i put them on i had to keep them. they were just too comfy to not have them. i felt so very relaxed in them. product as described and very comfy. colors are vibrant and material soft. quick service too. i would recommend this item to others! very comfortable, nice feel and shows the butt off well while being covered. i was looking forward to these but i must emphasize that you need to measure yourself before you buy. i\\'m a  person who is about 180lbs, and these fit but they were a little tight. i also have big legs so the pattern does not drape well. just be sure to measure yourself cause these are super cute. fit as expected i got these for my boyfriend after reading the fifty shades of gray series. i thought it was funny and he likes them. i\\'m a runner and these pants are perfect! they have the right amount of stretch and support. i just wish they made more designs and styles! i just got these pants and wanted to counteract the other reviewer because i feel differently.  they do not seem shiny at all.  in fact the material is very work appropriate and resembles the material of the limited\\'s stretch series work pants, which i have been wearing to work for the last decade-sadly they don\\'t make a pregnancy version.  also the length is good.  i am skinny (xs) and tall (5\\'8&#34;) and they skim the floor in flats.  this is nice for me and i almost wouldn\\'t mind them being longer so i could wear heels, but i know i\\'m very tall for my size (it looks like they would be easy to hem for those shorter). they are kind of a wide leg fit so they are nicely work appropriate but borderline baggy in the thighs.  they do not seem to fall down at all while wearing them and they look professional and polished.  the waistband is very comfortable!  if they were a durable/lounge-y material i\\'m not sure i would change out of them because they are so comfortable!  for the price, these are a great deal! shipment came 5 days after ordering<br />way before expected<br />iam very happy with my purchase<br />size runs small , med && large<br />i ordered a 27 and it was a small but it still fits ;-) i love these uniform pants. i worried the high waist would be uncomfortable since i am used to low-rise pants but i love them because now i never have to worry about showing skin at work when bending/reaching/squatting. they are comfy, functional, and wash/dry well. i ordered these pants from fashion pickle and got them in a day! they\\'re the comfiest pants i own, and are so stylish at the same time. they also sent a free gift with my purchase, which were earrings. i never had any other earrings or pants like this. both pieces are beautiful and so unique. i may have to order my sister a second pair because she\\'s jealous of how unique and beautiful the pants are.<br />can\\'t wait to order from fashion pickle again! thanks a lot ladies! very soft and light material.  i like the fit but it\\'s a little smaller than most larges i get.  it still stretches but i just can\\'t fold them over.  not a big deal to me as i usually wear longer shirts anyway.  i really like the flare as well. great product - highly recommend this seller fits just as wanted overall i like these pants and they\\'re definitely worth the price. i\\'m 5\\'9 and 130 lbs, a small according to the size guide. so that\\'s what i  ordered but they were too tight and therefore see-through. there was a fast, no-hassle exchange though and when i got the new pants (size m) they fit great, weren\\'t see-through, and a few weeks in have kept good fabric quality. no holes or anything, good flexibility... i absolutely love these leggings! love the fit but the fabric is very thin and pretty see through unfortunately. i was thinking about trying one size up so i don\\'t stretch them as much but i\\'m not sure that would help the sheerness of the fabric. fun pajama pants which i enjoy wearing around the house. good quality for the price and helps me to remember our recent cruise on the disney fantasy. please keep in mind these are light weight pajamas and not the heavier lounge pants which are on the market.  they are exactly as described by the seller. i like that they fit well, they have pockets, and a drawstring with a *lightly* elasticized waist (i can\\'t stand tight elastic - i usually remove it and insert a drawstring). these are very comfortable. wash nicely, no shrinkage (though i use a cool/cool setting, and medium heat in the dryer).<br /><br />i recommend these. nicely made. comfortable and soft. good fit. she loves it these are very comfortable and looks just like the pictures shown. great material, good quality, and an all around amazing product, my only complaint is it runs alittle big at least for me. but other then that, shipped fast and still looks great! extremely comfortable love the cut and fabric.  but is at least one size too big.  maybe a bit more these run large so buy a size down. i wish i had. but i\\'m hoping they shrink some,but either way i\\'m tired of trying to guess my size. i\\'ll just give them to someone they fit. i bought these pants because they made my rear look good.  how often does that happen?  where i bought them there were tons more colors (i chose cognac)as well as a great matching skirt and blazer.  also, the isaac mizrahi clogs go well with the outfit. the pants were initially a little long, but after a washing- they shrunk slightly. nice, inexpensive linen wide leg pant. love these leggings. same color as in the pic. i was skeptical to order it with shipping fee but i am glad i did great product and at a good price!  i will buy more. these fit as expected and were as depicted in the photo.  i like them and only wish they had been offered in a softer, more malleable leather or lambskin as opposed to the traditional stiff leather. these are great. they fit very comfortably and i love them because the length is good too. i\\'m 5\\'8 by the way so i like at least a 33&#34; inseam. however they are very thin so just be very aware of how u bend over. i would suggest squatting because if not people will probably be able to see your backside thru the pants. i could and so could my bf. i ordered a medium if curious. loved my scrubs. i love these pants. i wear between a 10 and 12 and 5\\'2&#34;. these fit well on my waist. my height does not take away from the style of the pants. reading the reviews significantly impacted this purchase. holy crap i love these so much. they do start to come apart at the seams just a little (nothing has came completely apart yet, i can just see where it\\'s pulling) with washings, but they were like 10$, i\\'m not terribly disappointed, and just try not to overwash. pros-<br />-really cute and stylish. nice alternative to the usual jeans and leggings.<br />-very comfortable!<br />-seems to be good quality. have so far held up to maybe five or so washes. no pilling, fading, or shrinking or other wear, though i haven\\'t had them long so i guess the jury\\'s still out on that one.<br />-great price, definitely worth it.<br />-not ill fitting<br /><br />cons-<br />-my biggest problem is that they are fairly see through!! i got the black and blue ones thinking since they were dark i wouldn\\'t have an issue. nope! tried them on in my dimly lit bathroom and immediately noticed my underwear. not a problem as long as i wear a long top, but still makes me paranoid and it\\'s a huge bummer.<br />-the material. i thought they would be some kind of cottony/linen type of material but to my dismay they are not. instead it\\'s some kind of shiny smooth thin material. they\\'re still soft and very comfy, just not the material or thickness i was hoping for.<br />-size and length. yes, as others have stated, they are verrry long. not that big of deal to me, i can always hem them. they are however a bit to big for me though that\\'s mostly my fault since i overestimated the size i would need. they fit well enough if i fold over the band so i can live with it, just make sure you get the right size, maybe even go down a size. they are stretchy so i wouldn\\'t worry to much about going a bit smaller.<br /><br />all in all i\\'m glad i got them, they are great pants even if i have a few problems with them. i\\'m planning on ordering some more in different styles (just in a smaller size this time!). i\\'m actually giving these as a christmas gift to someone, but i may have to order me a pair now! i got the zebra print and it has a cute heart shaped logo on one hip and i love the pink cuffed bottoms of the legs. and they feel nice. just a really cute, affordable pair of pj bottoms. this is an excellent product. it fits great and feels wonderful. i wear them under long sun dresses and it does exactly what i wanted it to--act as a slip and keep my thighs from rubbing together. highly recommend! good to workout in purchasing plus-sized workout clothes can be painful..not in this case!! the pants are buttery soft and the fit is fabulous! one of the main problems i usually have with workout pants is that they will fit my hips, but the legs are too short. the pants have a good length and the material is very light and stretchy. the picture does not do these pants justice..i wish land\\'s end offered additional colors as i would buy more pairs. land\\'s end did an awesome job with these pants! great fit, almost impossible to wrinkle, and very slimming!  great for every day, and especially so for travel!  i love these pants! love them, the fabric is great. they fit really nice, i definaty want to order more of these yoga pants. very nice great price it\\'s a very lightweight and comfortable material. it fits me nicely. i got the maroon colored one. it\\'s not see through at all. perfect for casual outing on summer evening. looks cool and chic fantastic fit.  very comfortable. i really can\\'t say enough good things about koi scrubs. the moment you touch the fabric, you realize that this is a quality product, and the colors are so much richer than most other available scrubs. i just wish they had more products in merlot! the lindsey bottoms are incredibly comfortable, i often don\\'t bother to change into other pants once i get home. i am a big fan of the cinch waist as opposed to elastic, my only complaint is that they are a little more low-rise than i like. fortunately, koi scrub tops are long enough to cover everything. nice.. it looks good on  me love it! before i ordered these pants i looked at the reviews and i have to say i was concerned because this product did not have the best reviews, but i decided to give it a chance and i am happy with my decision<br />my order came very fast and the pants fit great. the only thing i noticed was the length was a bit longer, however that is probably because i am short. it is a very easy fix and the pants fit so well that i can overlook that small part.<br />another great part is the packing it came in. i have never seen clothes sent so perfectly. this would make for a great gift for someone you know or if you would like to spoil yourself. you will be pleased.<br /><br />note: i received this product at a discount for my honest option. fits well and is very comfortable. bought by andrea orlando: i can say, i am a connoisseur of moletons and i have tried every major brand available from colombia, peru and the usa.  j.w. maxx\\'s may rip depending on the style, but these virgin only moleton jeans are composed of strong material that does not rip!! just make sure you order up in size, i normally wear a 4-6 or a 26 or 27 in seven for all mankind and a 28 in rock and republic and i ordered a large and they fit very comfortably...i can sit cross-legged with ease. i\\'m sure a size medium would have worked just as well, but i like to be extra comfortable. thank you virgin only for these hybrid jeggings, they are the absolute best &#34;jean&#34; style out there! very comfortable! love it! good. love these. they are soft, super comfy and feel exactly like a favorite pair of cotton yoga pants. the have great denim detail. at first i was scared to buy these tights but after asking a few questions about them i was assured that they would fit. and they do! i got a size bigger because of all the comments and i wish i didn\\'t. it\\'s to big! i do love them. made very well. the waist is a little tight, and the leg area is kind of uncomfortable at beginning, but it feels ok later. still very nice pants and warm. seriously freaking amazing and super unique, only thing like others have said is there is a slight plastics smell but sooo worth the price it\\'s unreal-keep purchasing from this buyer, i got my things a month earlier than estimated. super stoked. :) fair, fits weird, size and length. seems thrown together.  i purchase often from ellazhu, first time not that satisfied.  i may return this pair. all over narrower than my other scrub pants which is great, i don\\'t spend all day pulling my pants up!, really nice material,i got the tall and they are perfect in length. i\\'ll be buying more. i like these a lot, and will definitely wear them! they\\'re beautiful and go well with a red top/tank top.<br /><br />however, there doesn\\'t seem to be much seam allowance for your back-end, and sometimes i felt as if they were ridding up. i also wished they were a bit longer. i\\'m 5\\'4, but they seem to be made for someone with shorter legs still.<br /><br />overall, i really enjoy them! first, i love these pants; i ordered them for a trip to iceland in the winter, and, after reading the other reviews, i ordered them one size larger than normal so i could wear fleece pants underneath them. they worked perfectly, keeping me warm and dry in the freezing rain.<br /><br />i am giving the seller the high rating because of excellent customer service. i actually had ordered these pants from a different seller originally, and, because of how well they fit over my fleece pants, decided to order a second pair from gotapparel. unfortunately, the pants took a week to arrive at my house instead of the promised 2-day shipping, and i had already left for my trip by the time the pants arrived at my house. when i contacted gotapparel, they refunded my money and let me keep the pants. i will definitely order from them in the future. i\\'m giving this four stars simply because the fabric is wonderful and the item is well made.  i cannot give 5 stars simply because the item runs very small.  i am a l/xl at best.  the item i received is a 1x and was not flattering on me whatsoever. i am short (5\\'2), and the legs were about 5 inches too long.  the area that is to bunch at my waist could not, because i was having to pull it up so high to compensate for the extreme length. i am too embarrassed to post pictures as promised.  with all of this said:  the item itself is beautiful and extremely well made!!  it is light and airy and moves with your body.  it would certainly be quite attractive on certain body shapes; just not mine.  i\\'d like to thank the seller for the opportunity to review this item in exchange for my honest opinion. bought the blue as a 2nd pair for my wife. she loved the first pair (black) and wanted another pair because they were so comfortable. these capris are great!  don\\'t be fooled by the picture, they almost look like knickers in the picture.  however, in real life, these pants are great.  they have clean lines and classic styling.  a must have for spring, or if you live in the south, any time of year! soooo comfortable, and fun styles. i like the aztec print ones b/c the material is soft and feels kinda like cotton/rayon. not hot or sweaty at all. some of the ones i also bought from this same seller say hey are rayon, but are hot and sweaty. go with the aztec prints. they do stretch a bit, so i chose a size smaller for my subsequent purchases (bought 5 of them) fit great and love the color and exactly what i was looking for! i love these pants, but they\\'re a little big.  i\\'m 5\\'4 and have to use the strings at the bottom to tie the bottoms around my ankle to prevent stepping on them. pants arrive in a resealable bag. cloth feels a bit gauzy (in a good way). stitching is good. i\\'m 5\\'7&#34; and they hang about 1&#34;-2&#34; above the ground. laid back, stylish and comfortable? yes please.<br />this is my second pair, and i\\'m eyeing the third. i am 5\\'2&#34; and 94lbs. i wear a us size 0 or xs. the leggings fit just right and they do come up pretty high near my belly button just like in the picture. they are a tad fragile. i have a maltese puppy who jumped on me and caused a little run.. which really isn\\'t terribly visible given all the vibrant color going on. my daughter love love loved these pants. fit perfectly the quality is pretty good, i like the cotton and spandex mix,<br />it\\'s comfortable and fits nicely.  nowadays, can\\'t really find nice yoga pants at retail stores most have strange or awkward fit.  glad to have found these! they\\'re even prettier in person, the only problem is they fit a little tight in the thigh area as my sister is a curvy young lady, if you\\'re slimmer you\\'re unlikely to experience this problem. still a great buy! great item a++++ great buy. nice and warm without being bulky . ordered another pair in navy blue. thanks awesome great price read that they ran large so i got a size smaller and should have gone 2 sizes smaller very comfortable. exactly as i hoped  they would be. they  arrived on time and in perfect condition, however the photo does not do them justice, they were much prettier  in person .  they are perfect for dressy tunics and formal occassions . . well made, comfortable and fashionable!  love them! i love it. it\\'s a see thru material though. and it\\'s really runs small in size. i am a medium and i ordered an xl and it fits perfectly for me. got this and it\\'s really cute! i didn\\'t get anyway satanic kitties.<br />just normal cats .-.<br />nice fitting! thin, and a bit scratchy in the inside but it feels nice and good ^*^ and excellent quality. i wear them all the time... beautiful - only issue is (as many others have said) they are really long beautiful fit perfectly. feels great. i am 5\\'3 and these are way to long good great good fit, nice length, good value.  couldn\\'t ask for much more, i guess. they are pretty true to size, which isn\\'t too hard since they are stretchy. arrived well before expected date. gorgeous colour, really soft, and fits me perfectly. i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; and the pants fit me; i would however think that it could be a problem for taller women. very comfy easy to wear just love them . awesome cool-feeling, flowing pants! heavier than i thought, very well made, but i ordered the size i normally wear and i was absolutely swimming in them.  advise ordering a size smaller than you would normally. very comfortable and flaxy. like to wear all the time with different different tops. i want more of this. thanks too small love them! love them! leggings were great. good color no fade. perfect for cold weather. they were very warm. felt great. they are for my son ,he\\'s in the nursing field. they fit exactly as shown, are nice and airy. read my review for this suit in blue. there the same. i bought the suits in both colors. see what you think! this pants are great, they fit perfect, true to size for me and they wash very well, great value for the money, could not have done better i love these pants - and this style of pants in general. they fit well - i ordered an xl (i usually wear a size 12/14 jeans and a size 14 in dresses- kind of large hips!) the only problem i did have (which i have frequently, thus i didn\\'t take any stars off!) is that they are really long on me. i will have to have them hemmed. but other than that - they are very comfortable, very light weight and are quite flattering to my figure :) they could be considered to be a bit sheer - but they are in black so i don\\'t think it will be too much of a problem. i would recommend these pants if you like the style.<br /><br />tip: if you do find that they are too long and that you need to have them hemmed, be careful who you send them to! because of the material it is recommended that a serger be used. they are so comfortable. wear them all the time. in the summe  with ac on and winter. i am 5\\'8 and they are long enough and did not shrink great fit, color perfect. nice good fabric,  color stays true with washing i just got my pants - they shipped in quickly, they fit great - and they\\'re actually long! i like wearing my pants higher than most people do, so that\\'s perfect for me. and they look like they could be dressed up or dressed down. ladies, these pants are wonderful! i will be buying more!!! i want to say it was an excellent buy. i would like to day if u r short u will have to hem because they r long. that\\'d y i\\'m giving 4 stars. i got a small as i\\'m petite i would like to have tighter fit so an extra small to show more curve. if u don\\'t like tight fit then get whatever size u r like if. comfy pants. fits as expected. fades after just one wash so i decided to continue to wash by hand. its nice quality and very comfortable. just be sure to size up. perfect line of skinny  cargo pants very cute on these are nice and the waist is actually a high waist even if you are bottom heavy. lightweight fabric,  bright colors. leg is nice and wide where i wanted. love these pants - i live in them - perfectly made and wonderfully cool. good. these look good, are comfortable, and last well, but i have to turn the cuff up or get them hemmed.  i\\'m 5\\'2\\\\\\\\\". loved them super comfy but should have purchased the large, since i\\'m between an 8-10 and reading the other comments i thought the medium would be ok. these came in a great shade of purple that really works with both my wardrobe and my skin tone. the fit was nice, but pay attention to the size chart, as they only come in s/m/l with divisions i\\'ve found unusual. and i have to stress this: they have pockets! not tiny pockets like most of my skinny trousers and jeans have but real pockets, like those on my husband\\'s jeans. as a note: i just ordered these in black, and found them to run small. very comfortable and well made.  would buy again. feels good......and looks sexy obviously these leggings make a statement, and that statement is, &#34;i freakin love weed&#34; lol any stonerette ever in life would love these. thinking about getting them for your wife or girlfriend? do it, they\\'ll love it! they fit me pretty well! my son loves it i am a true medium and after reading the reviews that say mostly true to size, i ordered a medium. perfect choice. sometimes with allegra k they run way small so you have to look at the reviews closely. when i got it, i was not even able to get it over one leg until i realized there is a little zipper on the side that makes a huge difference. make sure you find and use that zipper before determining it doesn\\'t fit. as with all allegra k products, wash them on gentle and should probably hang dry them. this compliments curves very nicely. my favorite romper ever. i love it , perfectly sized , cute and comfortable , no more excuses for not going to the gym :) i\\'ve been looking for a pair of black gauchos for a long time.  these are awesome, the fit is perfect if you go by the size charts.  cotton fabric is comfortable all year long too.  shipping was quick and reasonable.  you can\\'t go wrong with these. :) they fit and feel great. granddaughter loved the jegging, i highly recommend this product. they are true to fit so check out the size chart and make your decision. they look great and are slimming. i have worn them dressed up with boots, and a nice dress top, or down with sneakers and a sweat shirt. they are comfy too. they wash well and in my opinion are a great product. will buy again. not disappointed at all. love them loved how it looks and feels.  great price for this item. will order more. love these pants!! was worried about how they\\'d look on me being a plus size woman, but they are great!!! love them!!!!! i\\'ve been looking for years for a pair of pants like this for bigger girls!!!!! to big, not true to size i really like these pants.i\\'m a med. but i just ordered a lg. they look good in a med. but they are thin so i\\'m ordering up to see which i feel the most comfortable in. these pants are so versatile! going out on the town, to a nice dinner party or just hanging out with friends these pants can fit into any event or if you just want to stay home and lounge. comfort and style are great and so many colors to choose from with an affordable price make sure to buy more than one pair!! :) i get so many compliments on these! awesome soft fabric!! these are a great fit for size 12 , 5\\'4&#34; daughter. came really fast and price was fabulous. very light material.  i\\'m 22 weeks pregnant and the high wide band is perfect! i haven\\'t worn my pants yet, however, i have tried them on and they fit.  when i was trying to figure out what size to order i wasn\\'t sure if the medium was the correct size for a my size 2.  it is the right size, unless you want them to be baggy. mine are loose but not baggy.  the pants are really nice looking, thicker cotton and seem very durable.  the price was right on, i felt like i got a good deal. the pants were long enough and hopefully they won\\'t shrink too much. nice fit gonna buy another pair was great product, fit exactly as expected, did not shrink in wash, fits great.<br />will purchase again from seller. runs a little small terrific customer service!! fast delivery. fits great and is nice quality. thank you!!! the fabric is very thin, but not see-through, i will definitely be buying these again. these came sooner than expected and fit as expected according to the sizing chart. i was a bit weary about getting these pants at first but now that i have them i am very happy i took the chance. the only thing that i did not expect was that the holes for the buttons were not &#34;open&#34; but that is nothing a pocket knife can\\'t fix. :) i love the koi brand pants. they are very comfy and fit great! i ordered these because i am pregnant and i didn\\'t want the maternity panel pants. i am now 33 weeks and they still fit great! wasn\\'t looking for petite but glad i did length is perfect. fit snug, just use to loose fitting scrubs. good quality love koi.. i gonna give this 5 stars because my mom liked it. &#34;5/5 moms would like on christmas.&#34; feels and looks great. these were a great fit. love the look. just what i wanted. these pants can be worn when in a relaxed mode and you want to be comfortable.  fit perfectly, and i love the color.<br />recommend purchase. absolutely great very comfortable & look nice. i really loved these pants, they fit well with my tall frame, and hid my tummy well (i\\'ve had two kids), i felt very long and slim in these pants. my granddaughter was very pleased, and she love it. i would recommend this site i love it too. i\\'m viewing to see what else i could find. a little tight for me in the thighs, but i guess that is a personal problem. these yoga pants are very comfortable, look good, and someone even asked if i had lost weight when i was wearing them (i haven\\'t.) as stated in other reviews, these pants are made of a thin material and sit low on the hips. they have held up well to washing and active use. i plan to order another pair. i own several pairs of these and i think they\\'re very comfy and they look nice very comfy... these pants are verycomfortable and wear very well.  the fit is as expected.  i prefer drawstring and the flared leg gives them a nice look.  very satisfied. these are my fave harem pants by far and i own about 6 pairs. my fave thing about them are the pockets, they\\'re the best! they\\'re really deep and big so for someone like me who hates carrying purses and bags i can fit the essentials (phone, wallet, keys, a lip gloss or two). and because the material is so stretchy you can fit even more stuff and no worries of it falling out. my only gripe is that these pants give me a wee bit of a wedge but that might be due to the fact that i mostly wear thongs so if you don\\'t it might not be so much of an issue. these pants can be dressed up or down so they\\'re very versatile and i always get compliments-everyone thinks they\\'re so cool :) soft enough to sleep in but a good enough black color to wear on a run to starbucks. i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; and the length was perfect for me, kinda like it is shown in the picture. love the material . very comfortable . i\\'m 5\\'9 and always have to buy tall but these were a perfect length for me . i did read other reviews and ordered a bigger size than i normally would .... perfect fit i like them a lot! they stretch very well and the lace is very pretty. (wear this with a black black pair of underwear so you dont look silly) they look just like this picture. enjoyed very much :) i gave these to my daughter as a christmas gift. she wears them often and really seems to like them exelente cool fast delivery and great product i\\'ve always been partial to alfred dunner slacks for their price point, comfort and good fit.  recently i\\'ve noted that they are becoming more and more difficult to locate in the shops and/or the selection is poor.  others must agree as i was only able to procure my selection in one of the advertised colors (in my size).  i did have the advantage of finding and purchasing a pair last summer and they had such a perfect fit in the inseam (petites) that i resolved to find more.....<br />  am i pleased? yes, i am very much so....and i would have bought two more pair had they been available.  i find they wash and wear well, are completely comfortable in every way everywhere and look nice enough for work or for casual living. i like it great fit.  using for spinning  classes and motorcycle riding.  provides much needed comfort. just got these in today...i ordered the teal and i love them!!! i will order more!! i am 5\\'7 and 150 and got the size small and are perfect!!! i will be wearing these to work as they are really comfy and look like dress pants. exactly what i expected!  i was very pleased. have ordered for years they wear well and fit comfortable finding work pants for a short person is next to impossible. i have given up, so even though the women\\'s formal career pants were long, i decided to give them a try anyways, fully aware that i’d have to hem them. based on the other reviews, i decided to go up a size in the pants – typically purchasing small sizes, but went for a medium – i’m glad that i did, as i’d have to agree, the pants run very small. i chose the chocolate brown color and it is perfect and looks nice. to be honest, i was truly shocked by the quality of the women’s formal career pants. they zip up and even have a button. they do fit nicely, even though they are not a typical size that would be purchased. i would recommend purchasing these, but go up a size. the pants feel soft and look nice and i think they will last for a while. i am glad that i was able to try them out.<br /><br />i received the pants for a discounted price in exchange for an honest opinion. i bought bright blue one these for a female luigi costume. the color was great! this will be an awesome costume and i can wear the pants again. the material is very thin though and seems to have a cotton look and feel. material stretches easy and the small was very comfortable on me. i was worried it would be tight. pants are very long but great with platforms or heels. this review is for the jungle mist pattern. think long and hard about your hemming needs. i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; and need to take off 4 inches. sure i can dust off my sewing machine (and cuss a lot, its dusty because i not only dislike sewing, my machine has bird nesting issues constantly), but as i prep them to hem, i\\'m thinking... wow, i\\'m going to lose a big part of the cool pattern... which is what i bought these pants for. i\\'m so disappointed at how much colored pattern i\\'ll be losing i\\'m actually considering slicing out part of the legs over the thigh and hiding the extra seam with ribbon or lace. (plan on using tunics anyway, so not sure how visible the seam would be.)<br /><br />i hate the tough decisions i\\'m making trying to fix the length, but if your not tall enough to wear these unhemmed,, do you really want these pants without the floral pattern on the bottom of the pant legs? because hemming means cutting that off.<br /><br />as to the body fit. mine fit a little odd. tighter through the seat and looser through the waistband. wearable but unusual for a fit. i am so happy i bought these and even happier that i bought two pairs. i will be back to buy more. i purchased the black with white foldover. i usually buy fold over pants from vs, but they are too expensive. glad i found these on amazon. i purchased a small, and they fit perfectly. i am 5\\'7&#34; 130lbs, 25 yrs old. cute, fits well, the material is thin and soft i\\'m 5ft  100lbs and petite the xs is perfect(fits like the picture) i was originally sent the wrong item and contacted the seller and it was replaced. shipping does take 2-3 weeks depending and most asian companies clothes tend to run small/petite and made of cheaper material if you have an issue with any of those i would look somewhere else but given the price its a deal. love these are like structured leggings. i wouldn\\'t classify them as jeggings, they\\'re a step down from those. i ordered the 18, i feel i could have easily gone down to a 16, maybe even a 14, they\\'re that stretchy. but they still offer a slim fit. cute for the price and the colors offered. they look great tucked in some boots. very nice fit, color and quality  is awesome !!! i love it! it fit me perfectly and looks flattering, the fabric is great and resistant. it almost makes me wanna go to the gym everyday haha. i do wish they were a bit longer, but overall they are very comfortable. i was hesitant about this purchase but they are just like the picture and i got them super fast! love them! the only thing is the colors were different from the picture but i still loooove them! i was thinking of ordering another one to see if would be slightly different!! so awesome! perfect great for the price - correct length for a petite figure awesome very unique color, almost like a deep violet, i have never had anything this color for pants and enjoyed the flattering fit and comfortable yet dresssy looking fabric. comfortable--not as thin material as expected but good for fall and winter loved it nice, beautiful, i liked it, however it\\'s too thin to be worn out easily. palazzo pants are quite the trend right now. i have a few pairs and love wearing them. this pair of palazzo pants is my favorite pair. i absolutely love the pattern and the pants are oh-so-comfortable! the material is mostly polyester with a small amount of spandex for a little bit of added stretch.  the best part is you can dress these pants up or down. they are great for wearing around the house and add some style and flare to any outfit. i have gotten a lot of compliments on my palazzo pants. they are true to size and fit great!<br /><br />i received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review just ordered a second pair! i almost love these.... they are really pretty and fit well including the length.  my only complaint is that for the price one would expect the pattern to be better matched.  it is not matched at all...  however, i just bought these to wear for casual things so they will do.  the fabric is nice.... it is a little see through but not enough to be a problem.  i have workout pants that are just as see through.  all in all.... i really like them. so comfy!<br /><br />they do get a bit thin because they are not made of the highest grade material but then again i paid under $20. i wore them once a week for a month and only recently started seeing them get rather thin. i wear long shirts anyway though so i still wear them! i like to hide my tummy and bum so my shirts always go below that line. beyond that they are not tight enough to see through! my 14 year old daughter loved the pants, fit great. would buy again. the pants are cute for my owl lover friend.  seem to be decently made.  will make a good christmas gift. a little pricey for what they are i think and the small i ordered seem to be a little large but they do have a drawstring.  hopefully she\\'ll be able to tighten them enough to fit. i\\'m usually a medium but am a large in these pants. they are very comfy and warm! i recommend them! these are my new favorite pair of pants and i think it is absolutely worth the money i spent, i got them a week early and they are a little bit on me but i like them like that, theyre perfect!!! these are great leggings! i really do like it, but the letters started to come off after the first time i washed them. it will haveto be washed inside out, but even after doing it that way the letters are still coming off! my mom bought me my first pair of miss me jeans and ever since then i have been buying them. fits perfect love these have them for a while and they still look nice and held up through many washes. i bought this as a present for my mom and she loved it. fits her perfectly and she definitely feels good when running or doing exercise. i loved the slacks but they were way too big. i normally wear 18\\'s. the waist fit pretty well but the hip and leg area were huge. i sent them back with instructions to send a 16 instead. my money was credited but i have not recieved my merchanize as of 7/10. i love my legging even though it is quite small, i thought it was going to be a little bigger, but i have no problem at all! comfortable and sexy love these leggings i had ordered a pair of these in large but was sent a medium, so of course they didn\\'t fit, but returning it was a snap. i got my large sized pants very quickly. they fit great and they are summery, fun and funky.  i appreciate the great customer service.<br />also as a side note, i am 5\\'10&#34; with a 34 inch inseam, and these are plenty long enough. i can even wear heels. a long legged girl like me really appreciates that! but the fabric has a nice design at the bottom with lots of horizontal lines, so if you needed to cut it shorter, it would still look awesome.  you wouldn\\'t need to hem it or anything super in length ( was hoping they would be long enough and they are)  slightly snug around the waist, but i am totally not built like the model in the pic.  if you are a larger girl, i would go a size larger.  still very pleased.  excellent fabric. these pants have a mid-rise and literally fit me perfectly.  the only thing i will do is stitch the pocket slits closed and remove the button on the back faux pockets for a smooth look.<br /><br />the fabric is lightweight, does not wrinkle, hangs beautifully and works for office or going out.<br /><br />i found them on clearance at beallsflorida, and the 18w short is a perfect fit. my wife is 5.6 and 105 lbs. ordered the small one for her and they fit perfectly. little money good fit. might order some more. i like it. it was just the way i wanted it. fastest shipment ever.  arrived in 3 days from ordering.  beautiful fabric and colors i got a medium and usually in pants i wear size 6 and it was a little fitted around my thighs but if your rear end is on the big side order a size up but i love how they look on me super cute...but the large was too small for this girl with curves...gave them to my teenage daughter who loved them runs small, so i bought a size up.  i usually wear an 8 and bought a 12.  i am short, but with heels, these are gorgeous!!! these are very comfortable, even better than expected. and you can\\' treat the price. the panties are just as i expected and fit great. they are so cute. however, note to future purchasers...the size on the website says, fits most - sizes 6-16 (due to stretching). i would disagree that they could stretch past a size 10. super comfy! i use these pants for running and for being lazy on the couch. they\\'re great. love these... so comfortable cute but i have too much booty for this jumper i love these pants, at first i was a little scared to order because i didn\\'t know if they would fit, but they fit beautifully... may end up getting another pair :) i like the look and the fabric of this pant. as i read the reviews, it seemed they ran small....so i ordered a size up. but, they were too big.<br />i normally wear a size 2, so that was a little disappointing. all in all...they\\'re great. i\\'ve searched for a pair of cargo pants for sometime that have all the pockets and are a heavier weight off material. good fit but long on me.  the regulars are too short. love these pants though my 15 years old daughter who is 5\\'5&#34;, 109 lbs. got the smalls and they were perfect. slightly room for her but fit totally as expected. they are comfy and cute and oh so soft! i have been searching for a decent pair of scrub pants for a while now. i have always had a problem with previous scrubs i bought not staying up around my waist. the koi morgan pants have an extremely comfortable yoga band that fit great around my waist. i no longer have an issue with my underwear showing or constantly having to pull my pants up. i weigh about 145 and roughly 5\\'7&#34;  the small and tall fit perfect! i\\'m so satisfied with these pants that i\\'m about to go buy a few more pairs in different colors :) i am short, just 5 foot.  these ankle length pants fit me just right for long pants.  saves me the expense of having them shortened.  also they wash beautifully and don\\'t require any ironing.....not even a touch up. i have got to say that when i ordered these pants i figured that they would not be soft leather. i was really suprised when i pulled them out of there package and they were really soft. also when they say that these pants do not strech they were not kidding. so i suggested buying one size bigger than your normal size unless you want them really really snug, then get your regular size. and no they do not squek when you walk in them. perfect for the beach! i will purchase a black one also! i ordered these pants and another pair for a costume... while these ones did not work for the costume, they are sooo soft and comfy. i\\'m keeping them for pajama bottoms! love them cute, comfortable, durable and at a great price! these pants are extremely cute, the small fits great, and they are long enough! (i\\'m 5\\'9\\', 120lbs.) i love them. it sort little bit. i\\'m 5,6. but size good. i really like these, they are very comfortable and i don\\'t think they shrank at all.  i recieved both of these as christmas presents.  delivery was timely and service efficient.  went through no problems.  i recommend them.  they have a medium flannely feel.  and look cute. get\\'s the job done, i like all my pockets, the pants are a little long though. i am happy with my purchase. i bought the orange and mud color and the pants received were similar to the color on the site; though belts were not included in my package.  fit wise, i\\'m 5\\'4&#34;, 120lbs and normally wear a 4 or 5 in jeans; i bought the xl and they fit well, roomy in the waist, good thing there is a drawstring waist band.  i\\'m, ahem, &#34;bottom heavy&#34; and they fit well there, without extra room though.  the pants have a 31.5&#34; inseam, with drawstrings on the bottom for adjustable fit; too long for me, i will cut and hem them.  100% cotton. very cute pants and very comfortable. they are a bit scratchy the first time you wear them. also the first time i put them on, they were tighter in the butt and then throughout the day they got bigger and bigger and bigger to the point where i was pulling them up! they are a great length though for taller gals - i am 5\\'8&#34; and the medium was a great length. also, just be aware that the waistband is a bit loose. i am in no way a skinny mini - i weigh about 150lbs. and the waist seems loose for fold over pants. i wish they were a bit more snug. nice sturdy pants, true to fit i looked long and hard for these. i bought one pair, now i am buying more. i love the fact that it sits down around my hips. i feel to confined with pants up to my waist. they feel great and the pockets are deep for my phone. perfect to wear outside and in home. i bought the pants to wear during our summer months when working in the garden or when doing housework. they are very comfortable to wear and have plenty of pockets for things i need when outside working. i am pleased i bought them. i wear size 10 and i am 5\\'9\\'\\' tall .i\\'ve bought size l and it fits great.quality is ok too for wearing to the office.<br />good stuff for the summer. the best pants ever!! very long though. i\\'m 5\\'4 & wear a l. these are crazy long. i had a lot taken off the bottom. if you like big bell bottoms, these are the pants for you. very nice material, great tight through the thigh fit & awesome velvet material. shiny black. can be worn dressy or casual but only if you are cool enough to wear such a big bell! incredibly flattering & comfortable. i got these in a large. they are a bit tight and hard to get on at first. almost more like a small/medium. but once you\\'ve got them on and they get loosened up they aren\\'t bad i love these. i thought i would have to wear flat sandals with them but they are long enough to wear my platform wedge sandals. the pants are a little big but thats my own fault! the music note pants are totally cute! love them!!! look just like they do in the picture! totally thrilled! cant wait to wear them! she runs around the house with these on. the hot pants look great. she says they fit well.<br />i think i  paid $4.95 for it. cheep price.look good. comfortable. if you get this for your girlfriend<br />just wait till she bends over. love them they fit perfectly i will order from this company again my friends love them i was a little skeptical due to the low price of these leggings.  the size was good.  they didn\\'t sag in the seat or knees after wearing them for 16 hours!  color was true and perfect for my smurf costume.  i would recommend these and plan to look for this merchant when ordering in the future. the quality of these pants wasn\\'t the problem it was the size. way to big!!!!! the pants are fabulous!  the fit, quality and price are all perfect.  get them before they run out...don\\'t snooze and lose!!! fabric is wonderful, fit is smooth, not binding, the quality of workmanship is super. it wasn\\'t even wrinkled after shipping! love i am 5\\'4, 145 lbs, big bottom, and hips, size 6 woman, i was scared to order because i always have a hard time with pants fitting me tight around my bottom and loose in the waist. these fit me perfect! i love them. they don\\'t fit too loose or tight just the way i wanted them to fit. i recommend washing them only when needed by hand with cold water, and hanging them to air dry. love them order in pair in my normal size and had to return because they were too big and got a replacement.  now could use smaller still size but they are all gone except 4x. this product fits well, but is very long. the legs on the pants go past my feet. i recommend these pants to anyone tall and slim. the product shipped on time. love these! heads up that &#34;individual waist band&#34; means it will be different than the one in the picture, the material was also very red compared to the brown of the image, the pattern was the same. these are super comfy, only thing that\\'s difficult is to sit with one leg crossed over the other without rearranging the pants. these are super comfortable and very nice. i got them originally for my brothers wedding and then shortly after ordering them i found out that i was going to be a bridesmaid so i had to get a dress and didn\\'t get to wear these for the wedding like i intended to but they have gotten a lot of use out of them and they match a lot of the black\\'s i have in my closet already which is really nice because not all blacks are the same. any who very comfortable and soft look very dressy and look like a skirt depending on how you stand. mine has already been mistaken as a skirt many times already and people are always surprised when i tell them it\\'s not a skirt. so if you don\\'t like wearing skirts but are looking for something that looks like one these work great. these pants are awesome!!! well worth the money and the wait. very well made. material is very thick. i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; and 155lbs with a chunky build. (obviously. lol) these fit perfect. not tight and just loose enough to be very comfortable. a tad long but not a problem. these are real cargo pants as opposed to the majority of cargo pants on the market which i\\'ve found to be over priced and pretty flimsy. liked them so well, i\\'m ordering two more in different colors. these seem to be pre-washed material so they are not stiff and can be worn comfortably right away. nice fit, very warm, comfy. i could live in these. i washed and they did not shrink. love them! :) okay, i agree with all of the other reviews, the line in the middle is not flattering..like at all. i recommend you go up a size. but if you have hips like myself, you might want to reconsider. it kind of creates extra muffin top =/ these lounge pants are very comfy and just the right weight fabric.  not too light, but just warm enough for chilly nights in the south. they are really nice gonna buy another pair. i really like the warmth and the fit of the long underwear. the waist band is not too tight. i\\'m 51 and about 154lbs these leggings fit really well they do go a tiny bit shear on my bum but i\\'ve got a bit of a bigger butt lol i love wearing these leggings under extra long shirts and short dresses love these pants. ....comfy lounge wear. the waist fits as a large but the length is way too long. i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; and even in wedge sandals the pants were like a set of drapes on the floor. i even washed them in hot water and dried them on high hoping to shrink them with no luck.  not sure when i\\'ll actually wear these unless i get them hemmed. loved them!! i love these pants.  the colors are terrific.  they are comfortable and have nice deep pockets, great for lounging but nice enough for company.  i\\'ll return for more! comfortable all good, recommended i love these, but they do run small! i usually wear a size m and i bought a size l. still a bit snug. this pants is amazing..i ordered medium and fits me well. no wrinkles after washing.. true light tan, easy wash and dry plus a great design for me. i dislike anything with a \\'tight\\' fit but these pants have a neat front fit that allows for both comfort and style. the waist band gives one the option to tuck in a top. the pockets add convenience. i am 5\\'2&#34;, weigh 115 pounds and measure 62&#34; around shoulder, through crotch and back to shoulder. size 8 is just perfect for me. the fabric \\'holds\\' a crease if that is your choice . . . easy fit that looks and feels just right. i was surprised to find these at such a low price . . . not \\'seconds\\' or \\'irregular!\\'  definitely recommended. these are appropriate for most ages . . . i\\'m 68 years old and the compliments have been fantastic! i love these pants and all the pockets...functional and comfortable!  they fit well...according to the \\'size chart\\'....and they work well with my body type...(boyish figure)...  very cute!!! gracias... came in on time. the fit was really small true to size and im very colorful i would truly recommend a pair in all different colors i love them this is a wonderful buy.  perfect fit and soooo comfy!  i might have to buy a few more pairs.  i recommend this to everyone. great product and excellent seller i love this! although it doesnt fit me perfectly, a little loose in the bum, i am very comfortable wearing these. they are fun and breathable. i have gotten many compliments. love these capris i had never heard of swim pants before until i came on amazon and saw these. i never look good in regular swim shorts, so i decided to take a chance and try these.<br /><br />i can now say, with confidence, that i couldn\\'t be more satisfied with this product! honestly, they fit me like leggings. they\\'re well-made, light weight and surprisingly have a lot of stretch to it.<br /><br />since i am 5\\'5 196lbs, i decided to order xxl (which is two sizes from what i normally wear) after reading the other reviews. they\\'re a little baggy on me and not so form fitting, but that was what i wanted. i like that it comes up to my ankles. if you dont want them fitting snug, you might want to order a size or two up.<br /><br />i combined these with a rash guard shirt and a swim skirt. it looks so cute! very happy. i purchased these pants a few days ago, i am mostly in love with them as i wore them to sleep and then went to work in them. but they are not perfect.<br />pros<br />1. very versatile looking, they look very formal when you tug your shirt under it; and when you cover them with t-shirts, they look and feel just like any stretchy yoga pants.<br />2. comfortable, obviously as they are stretchy.<br />3. amazingly shaping my hip pretty well. i have bigger than average bottom, but when i put them on they are actually hugging them and somewhat lifting them pretty well, especially the black pair that i got, kinda disguise my shape and flatter my body pretty well, according to my husband.<br /><br />cons<br />1. i was about to wear them for the remaining cold weather, but they seems to be made with synthetic stretchy fabric instead of cotton that contains my heat, i believe they works slightly better for summer.<br />2. they shrink about an inch or two after drying.<br />3. i hope they have slim cut in the future as i bike. i need to use rubber-band to hold them when biking right now. i ordered the small and it was wayyyyyy too small. i\\'m a small in everything, about a 4 in pants. re ordered the large and it fits perfect! if i was any taller the crotch would be a little too tight but it\\'s fine for now. definitely not for anyone taller than 5\\'4. large but cute fine darker than the picture but very cute and fits nicely! seems to be good quality but if you get a really light color you may need to wear something under it. i still lov the style and cut good love this pants, very nice and pretty. they are a little long.  i will use it my high wedges. love these pants, super comfortable. only problem is that it\\'s a little sheer in the butt. cute tights, but i do not like the quality of the shirts for the price i expected better fits perfectly. quicker delivery than estimated. long lasting and better quality than my lululemon pants!!! definitely will purchase online again. great online pricing too. i love love love the pants and they wash up real nice.  i like these so much that i have several pairs. i bought these in plaid and in zebra... then ordered a pair for my daughter, then another pair for my niece.  they are such a nice weight that one of them decided to wear them to the corner store to pick up a soda.  i also like the cuff.  it buttons up, so stays there and my niece unbuttoned hers for the extra length. bought these for my daughter.  they fit a little smaller than expected, but she still really liked them. they were great quality. love them other than being a little small for a 3x, these are great! love the cut, feel and material of these! good quality fit comfortable well make in usa. well order them again! wanted to wear it for work but i don\\'t think i can pull this one off, it\\'s more for at home or going out with friends. i like it though, very soft fabric, comfortable, and lightweight. yes a good size pants for me.like material and color. i like more pant with long legs and short long. love these! i wore them for a 5k run, and got many smiles, positive comments, and a couple of requests for how to get them. i\\'m looking forward to wearing them for tabata tonight! the design is beautiful and has vibrant color, although they are definitely see through. i\\'m just over 5\\'8, 145lbs and purchased the large. probably should have went with xl because they fit tighter up top than i\\'d like. i have long legs so the length is perfect for me. i love these cargos. i been looking for them everywhere, they fit right at the hip i dnt even need a belt. they are so comfy and i just got me another pair. :) excellent product, highly recommended. it fits good. got this for my wife and she loves it. nice but runs very small i am 5\\'8 and wear a size 14.  i wish i had ordered a size up, the pants i purchased were a large (they didn\\'t have the design i wanted in an xl).  i am happy with everything about these, though, from the material (which is somewhat thin, but flowy and not see through) to the fit.  they are long, which is a plus for me, and they hang nicely.<br /><br />i purchased these on march 4th and they arrived on march 13th.  had it not been for a weather delay (obviously not the vendor\\'s fault) they would have arrived on the 11th.  i would gladly buy these pants again, just a size up. love it! these leggings fit my wife perfectly.  she has multiple pair in black and one in silver. not too shiny or dull. just the right amount. they are really really cute on, i\\'m tall and it\\'s hard to find pants to fit,but these fit just great !<br />thanks toni these pants fit like a glove. i\\'d order another pair. they are a snug fit, and the material is light. perfect for wearing around the house in warmer months, too. i\\'m tall and have long legs, and these are long enough for me. i realize now that i should have gotten a women\\'s petite size.  elastic around the waist was too tight for her. i did like the color of these pants since she likes anything blue. great pants. just need to wash a few times because colors bleed. i work out at a gym almost every day.  i am not into lycra or skin tight pants but i also don\\'t want to look like a schlub.  these jogger pants are so comfortable and cute.  the pants are a little expensive but they are really great so i bought them anyway. ok... sooo first tip.  check the sizing chart and make sure you\\'re ordering the correct size.  i just assumed i should order a medium because that\\'s what i typically order for lounge type pants, however, even though i ordered the wrong size i think that these probably run a little small. these are very cute linen pants (keep in mind that linen wrinkles and is a bit scratchy - especially at first).  i am 5\\'5&#34; 155lbs with a soft yet athletic build. my waist (around the belly button) is 30&#34; and my hips around the widest area are 40&#34; (dem squats, yo!). i can put these on and wear them, but they\\'re tight, and not the look that i was going for. jogger pants should have a looseness to them, and these didn\\'t due to fit problems. even if i had ordered a large, i\\'m pretty sure they still would have been a bit snugger than i wanted them - style wise. construction wise, they seem to be of moderately good quality and should hold up to a normal wash and wear.  for the money you\\'re getting a nice pair of pants.  i have not washed these yet, but when i do i\\'ll try to post an update. i ordered navy and this is a very dark - almost but not black type navy.  they\\'d look very nice with a variety of tops and some cute sandals.  overall: these appear to run a bit small, order a size up maybe two if you want them a little extra loose.  the drawstring is functional so that should take care of any looseness in the waist. nice cute linen pants for the money. i wear a size 10 so i bought a large just about in all the colors and they are awesome!!!!! they fit great not to tight or to small!!!! i would recommend zenana fold over yoga pants in all colors!!!! these are the most comfortable leggings with the softest material on the inside. i would wear these every day. and everyone at the gym loved them. i put a 5 because it showed up earlier then expected and it also fits very well.its a bit long but that\\'s normal for my height. fit perfectly and pretty too wow.  what a wonderful fit.  so light and flexible.  just like wearing nothing at all.  i love it. i ordered another immediately. perfect fit i love it i bought these for a costume n they look great. im 5 11 n bought a large. they dont strech because of the material but not an issue. see title where i said, &#34;great pants, easy to get in to!&#34;  also, easy purchase and arrived quickly thanks to amazon prime. great maternity pants (i\\'m still wearing them 2 months after my baby was born). my only issue is that they\\'re very long, so the bottoms drag on the floor and get stepped on. these are super cute-not for use in public but my husband absolutely loves them! my side ties are wider than pictured but i like them that way for their purpose. :) that is why i marked that they ran somewhat small.... love the fabric, but the cut is baggy, loose and too long for a petite. perfect fit in terms of the waist and the legs. the pattern is so cute and the fabric is soft. great for home pants. i am yoga pants obsessed so i ordered these thinking they would be like the other pairs i got on amazon (which are actually the cantina juniors fold over...not to be mixed up) they definitely stretch out a bit after only a few hours of juge, but they\\'re the right length and are extremely comfortable. i thought they would be thin and cheesy, but they are not.  i work out in them all the time. very fun dance outfit to dance for your sweetie theyre cute as helllll and i just love them. a little loose cause im so freaking skinny but other than that i love them love these pants! so cool and comfortable and can be dressed up or down. you do need to wear seamless panties (or none at all) as panty line will show. i like the material and they are fit perfectly. i wear them in the gym. i love it.. great nice suit. i thought the jacket looked richer in the catalogue but it was a great value. the shell is lovely. i ordered these for my 19yr old, (one love) hippie daughter and she loves them. put them on 3 days ago and hasn\\'t taken them off since. however, this review is a little misleading, as the pants i received had two zippers on the pockets instead of a zipper on the front, and the waistband was the same material as the pants, not a faux leather one. i guess i got lucky with this mis- deliverd item as she loves the one we received. trying to find them in a different color. good luck with the grab bag you might receive. love the soft and creaming pants. they wear beautifully!!!! very warm, can wear outside with zero temps and no longjohns.<br />run a size smaller.  i ordered 2xl and they are more an xl.<br /> i expected that and planned accordingly as i wear an xl. love them, so comfortable! very cute and comfortable! super comfy! way nicer than i was expecting, i normally wear a 6 or 8, i ordered the 10 and they fit perfectly. love the style and belt but the rise is just a bit to low for me, i prefer a mid rise. my only complaint. love them very comfy and not to hot also there a little bigger than expected but its fine. enjoyed them. very cute and lovely a little over priced i must say really like the capris. fit well and are very comfy. product colors were beautiful. but after even one wash the colors faded quickly. i know you get what you pay for in this case i was wishing otherwise being i love the fit and color. great will buy more. it fits just as it looks... and i like it :) although the orange is a little bright... but its ok... great tried this on and fits perfect love the feel and like the length. love the wide legs it don\\'t show my leg brace.these are the best pair of pants, i own fix\\'s perfert very long perfect fit love the cotton/spandex blend...super comfortable! much better than poly or nylon blends. perfect fit!!! sizing was accurate! perfect skinny pants with &#34;liquid&#34; look. i love my new pants, i\\'m ordering more! i really love these they fit perfectly i wear size l and bought a size l very cute. lots of fun to wear. i got a lot of compliments. i do wish they came in other sizes, i am 5\\'9&#34;, and high waisted and about a 10-12 in women\\'s size pants, so these were almost not long enough but i made it work. i also wish the waistband was bigger and thicker, it tends to fold over and not feel as comfortable. but overall, i do not at all regret buying these. they are so totally cute. these linen dress slacks fit slightly too big. but are gorgeously classic and very hard to find.<br />just what i\\'d been looking for. love them. my wife loves them gift for my daughter.  she loves them! i like the look. the lines look with the matching jacket is great. the pants run a little big but still look great i love these peacock harem pants so much , the material is almost silky and my daughter will be able to wear them as a one piece also , unfortunately i can only wear them as harem pants and that\\'s ok as i will be using them for yoga and casual dress around the house or to picnics and things like that , i recommend to any yoga sisters and to the confident casual dresser, liberate yourself and your health will improve and the world will be a better place if you have hips order one size up. i am 6\\' tall and the length is perfect. comfy, easily dressed up or down. great pair of pants for vacation comfy !!! these came super early which was great, and they\\'re very cute. however they do run a bit small. i\\'m 5\\'7&#34; and about 123lbs and i ordered a medium and they are rather snug. the stitching in the front is relatively weak and i had to stitch it over myself in order to keep the front panels together, but now they\\'re fine & i get tons of compliments when i wear them. overall, great purchase! just consider ordering a size up. overall i like them but a little tight in the seat these pants fit great! very soft and comfy! love these. i bought like 4 pairs of different kinds.  all these types of stretch palazzo pants fit great and are very comfy.  this print looks great on.  very nice.  i am 5\\'6&#34;, 130 lbs, and the mediums fit perfect.  i\\'m guessing they\\'d fit if i was 10 lbs less, and up to 20 lbs heavier, guessing...  they are long.  they drag a bit with 3 inch heels.  doesn\\'t bother me. i border on xl (5 \\' 10&#34; 180#) , got tall large.  i would like it a little snugger (medium?), but overall pleased i love these! i got them in brown to wear for my belly dance performance, and they were perfect! i am 5\\'6\\\\\\\\\", 130 lbs and i ordered the medium. they fit perfectly and the length is great. the bottom hems just brush the floor without dragging. the material is a nice soft stretchy polyester/microfiber type deal. very comfy and breathable. overall a great product. i want to order the red ones too! i bought these leggings after my girlfriend recommended them to me.  they do suck in a lot around your abdomen.  they fit and feel nice.  they do run a bit long but i think they are suppose to. it\\'s difficult to find workout pants that aren\\'t way too long and these are really perfect! the weight of the fabric is very nice - heavy enough without being bulky. really like these! it is cute and the material is nice. you may get more than usual amount of attention if you wear these back to front<br /><br />never worn them myself these pants are really comfortable, i could sleep in them if i had to! they run very small. i ordered an xl and i wear a size 9/10 and they fit good and snug, as they should. if you have a &#34;mommy pouch&#34; i would recommend not getting these or wearing spanx underneath, as it doesn\\'t \\'tuck\\' that area in. the material is pretty soft and feels nice. i received this product in exchange for my honest review. very very cute but runs kinds small cute and comfy. definitely thin material, but not too thin to wear out. love these ever so smooth, comfy, trendy, and stylish drop crotch, i\\'m happy with this purchase 👌 love, yet hubby did not hand wash and dealing with some shrinkage. :/ according to reviews i ordered a size larger than i normally wear and it fits like a dream. these are very comfortable pants and definitely black (i was worried cause the pictures make it look grey). love them! i just got my jeans today and they fit so perfect. it\\'s for me to find the right jeans to fit. i\\'ll be buying more.. i love it!!!! i washed and wore this hours after receiving it in the mail. very soft and light pant with stretchy feel.  the royal dark blue color is vibrant.  the length is a bit long, but easy to cut.  this extremely comfortable pant is now my favorite pair of pant to wear.  the 1x size fits well and pant legs are roomy.  i hope to buy another one soon. great material and fit absolutely love my new scrubs! the material of the pants is of a higher quality; thick, stretchy, and soft.  they fit a little tight on my behind, so i am returning them. i am only 4 months along and i don\\'t think they will fit throught the rest of my pregnancy. i also found pants for a little less at higher end clothing stores. these scrubs fit well, got a medium and i am 5\\'6&#34;, 148lbs, perfect length too. fabric is soft. love the color! the length, and the width runs large. i bought these for my wife as a early present and wasn\\'t sure if that was the right decision to buy clothes for her online. she\\'s taller: about 5.09 / 140 and about a size 6. i erred on the side of tight and bought a smaller for her rather than a medium. they are a little tight but that\\'s the point! the material has a fair amount of stretch. was a bit concerned about size/fit, but they are very true to size and fit perfectly!<br />the fabric is thick enough for coverage, but not so thick that it is bulky and hot.very comfortable and perfect hip rise too.<br />will be ordering more! i enjoy wearing these pants. i\\'ve even taken to putting leggings on under them (long and short) in order to wear them in public. the colors and fabrics are nice. i only received one pair that aren\\'t for my taste, but since they are revearsabable, i just use the other side. i like them so much that i\\'ve reordered. my penguino loves her penguin pants. wears them all the times. love that they are super comfy and have pockets. would definately recommend to anyone who wants some lounging pants. great sleep pants nice and comfy beautiful but sooooo long! i\\'m 5ft 2&#34; and can\\'t even wear these with wedges without them dragging but still love them the fabric is beautiful these are thicker than your typical legging, but they aren\\'t really fleece lined. they have a thicker material, but aren\\'t super warm. they are also a little shiny--just slightly. overall, great purchase for the price! pretty but too small to do yoga in. i bought this because i hate the idea of wearing shorts in the summer, but needed something more lightweight than jeans.<br /><br />the color is a little brighter upon opening it, which made me happier. instantly put it on and loved it! the fabric is light but not see through. being a heavier gal (5\\'6&#34;, 200 lbs), i thought it may be too tight, but isn\\'t. fit\\'s just right! will definitely be buying this in other colors for the summer. great work pants love, love, love this!  zero complaints!  what a dream of a product! the pants fit well and looked great on. on a night out, people kept asking where i got them. shape-emphasizing. nice, enjoy wearing these. it\\'s lovely. ...and amazing. .. because of th cut will have to see once washed if they shrink liked the little bit of elastic in waist the fit is a bit small but not so bad that i had to return it. i like the black with the with strip on the side because it looks nice and feels good on. too long i love these pants i plan to buy more this month they are so comfortable and go with everything! nice pants but tooooo big!!!<br />il def order again but a size down love them in every way.  perfect for cold and hot weather alike.  wish i could wear these 24/7. they also fit very well- im barely 5\\'2&#34; and about 118 pounds, and even for a shorty like myself these pants fit great. *one tip*~ these pants are thin and 100% rayon, so they will shrink and should not be placed in the washer or dryer, as they are very very delicate and as i said, will shrink. i just hand wash mine then hang dry them. my friend has two pairs as well, he\\'s about 5\\'10&#34; and weighs as much as me and they look great on him too! one of his pairs has a hole in the crotch though, as he danced a little too hard at a festival and tore a hole in his pants. just a reminder of their fragile nature. the pants are very comfortable and lightweight....they float when you move.....the waistband is very comfortable....the size was right...they don\\'t run small or larger than the size says....they are long and needed hemming but i did that with no trouble....the color is nice and bright..... the print is clear and the fabric is not see thru. the small size fits well not too tight or uncomfortable and the length is good. these are so comfortable i will buy several more. i like them so much that i ordered a second pair in a different fabric.  slimming & sexy while durable. these are awesome! they are a pretty outstanding pattern which i was totally going for. they are extremely comfortable and very soft. they are not thin or see through whatsoever. i wear about a 1 or 2 regular length in jeans so i ordered a small and they fit very well. they are stretchy so my size 5 sister in law can fit in them as well. i highly recommend these leggings if you like outstanding patterns. they are also exactly as pictured. nice fitting, elegant look and feels pleasant at touching the fabric. i did not washed them yet, but i do not think that this fabric would create problems.<br />completion: after 1 year of heavy use in cosmetology day school (washed 3 to 4 times/ week, the color looks like the day when i bought them. i love this pants! comfortable pants, must order them a size smaller, and be careful, once you wash them they shrink in length. these are a great mid weight pant. flexible and very nicely lined. perfect for outdoor activities. i love both pairs of my hatley pajama bottoms.  i purchased &#34;all a flutter&#34; and &#34;ruff night&#34; they are so comfortable and so much better than any of my other pajama bottoms.  my sister recommended them to me.  she was on target, yet again!  do not hesitate  to purchase this product.  but, give yourself time for i found it took a few days for them to arrive. mc as you would expect from pendleton, these pants are very well made.  the navy is true; the pants are lined.  i generally wear a 14, but these pants are too small around the waist for me.<br /><br />if you have a better figure than mine, they would make a wonderful addition to your dress  pants collection. bought this for my wife. perfect fit. looks comfortable on her too. if you do now own an iron or ironing board don\\'t order this outfit.  its a great outfit and love how comfortable it is but it does need ironed after each wash.  i don\\'t mind ironing but i\\'m from the old generation. great quality product i love it nice item, so confortable and soft. i like the quality and the size is perfect for who will use it. omg these are definitely plus size..  they arrived quick... they slide right on no problem & they feel so good to my skin! i love these & will be ordering more in the future!!! they are cute and comfy! i got them in a week. i got these pants for a halloween costume. they look exactly as pictured, are lightweight and arrived promptly. good value for the price. these are well fitting, attractive and sized just right! these pants are so cute and comfy! they arrived today and i\\'m wearing them right now. the only reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that they are totally see through. i\\'ll have to wear some kind of black spandex shorts underneath, but that\\'s manageable. they are long, but totally workable. love these pants! perfect length.  but one size did not fit me.  greatly disappointed.  clearly i need to lose weight.  i\\'ve seen these on other people and they\\'re cute.  so i look forward to fitting into mine.  i was very pleased at how quickly the item arrived.  also had instructions on how to properly wear these unique trousers.  overall, i wish more had been said about sizing, but otherwise it was a good shopping experience. i bought these as pants because they came in white. i needed something to go with my martial arts uniform during pregnancy, because the elastic waistband on the regular pants was very uncomfortable. these fit the bill perfectly; the waistband is very wide, comfortable and stretchy. they were a couple inches too long and had to be hemmed, but that wasn\\'t a big deal to me. better too long than too short. i wouldn\\'t say the material is see-through, but also wouldn\\'t recommend wearing bright polka dot panties with them. i loved it very nice.. fits comfortable my daughter absolutely loves these!! she loves all the different breeds of cats on them! i liked the way the pants fit when you put them on at first, but the waist band expands throughout the day and are falling off by the end of the day. they are very comfy though and i do like them. i\\'m in my 40\\'s, mother of a teenager, and i have lots of disfigurement from the waist down, so i never feel good in &#34;traditional&#34; swimwear. it\\'s always crawling into places where it doesn\\'t belong or it never covers enough. these, though a bit long, are just perfect! covers everything, holds in what likes to move of its own accord (lol), and suitable to put a beach dress over and head to the mini mart across the street because they look like regular leggings otherwise. quite comfortable, no pinching, strong seams. i\\'m absolutely looking forward to spending a day in the surf in these! fit great!!! love the print and fabric! to start - i hate buying clothes online.  i tend to have bad luck with or without sizing charts involved!  i was so happy when these pants showed up super fast, and fitting just like i had hoped they would.  these are the kind of pants you could dress up or just look comfy cute in, at 5\\'6\\\\\\\\\" i found them a little long, but if you like rocking a heel, they will be perfect.  to help with sizing, i wear a 14 in jeans, i am all curves, especially through my hips.  i purchased the 18/20 to be safe, i\\'m glad i did.  while i think the 16 may have fit as well, (they are very stretchy pants) i won\\'t be worried about any shrinking in the wash this way.  as a previous post said, these are very flattering and super comfy.  all in all quite pleased so far. i love these, it was a little too long, but the fit was perfect. the material is so soft, which means a lot to me since i deal with chronic pain and certain material make the pain worse. these are great summer pants. the fold over is perfect as a styling option or even to smooth out stomach area when wearing a fitting tank. they are flattering and very versatile. bought them in all 3 colors and now i can\\'t stop wearing them ! best post baby pants ever love it got it in pink black n is perfect fit . i use 2xl n i got a size xl cause the are spandex new favorite jeans, i\\'m in love 💯💯😍 they\\'re fairly short on me and i\\'m only 5\\'4&#34; but they\\'re super cute and worth the buy. i really love the fit and the way it looks on!!!! great quality.  stands up to wear as advertised. the are a little short, and i\\'m 5\\'6 but nothing that couldn\\'t be solved with a pair of boots! they aren\\'t see through and are very cute! love this wide skirt, very trendy, looks like a pant but wears like a skirt! it\\'s great and really comfortable i got an xl and it was just a bit too big for me! fit wonderfully .very comfortable and look stylish.even my fifteen year old granddaughter asked me to buy her a couple of pair. very good quality, fit is great. the color is just as seen online, and the material just as nice. great buy for those who want to avoid sweating through their clothes. {smiling} very pretty and loose fitting wide legged pants. be sure to have your measurements because these pants are just as they measure online. great buy. these are perfect,  and you can\\'t beat the price! i bought these last year and had to buy more this year because they are so comfortable and stylish. these are great pants fit and material is great will be buying more of them in other colors this is a great workout pant in a very fun print. buy 1 size down though. i wear a 3x in all other active wear but these are way too big. im a very curvy gal so you\\'d think it would stay up but kept falling. the 2x fits perfectly. the size 3 was a bit larger than what i usually consider a size 3. it is unfortunate as the pants looked really cute and appeared to be well made. returning the item was easy and if my size turns up i would consider buying through this company again i\\'m short, 5\\'1&#34; and these pants were the perfect length and great fit.  very comfortable and nice material.  would definitely buy another pair! very comfortable. tight but not too tight. kept me very warm at an evening football game. looking forward to testing them on the slopes. i would say its about a size or two big, but since i\\'ve been making more healthy lifestyle choices, i may have lost weight. i can definitely say that i love these pants. they are thin, but you won\\'t get cold in them (btw, i live in chicago, crazy weather!). i may purchase more pairs of these pants. i absolutely love these pants.  i had already some full length pants and these are my second pair of shorts.  these were the first the first pants i bought in this style off amazon.  they took about two weeks but well worth the wait, as they say.  im 5\\'10, 32/33 in the waist and about 160 pounds.  they fit perfect.  resting below my knees and there\\'s plenty of room for the string to work properly.  i wear them everywhere.  but that\\'s just me.. love the fit gorgeous and so comfortable! i get so many compliments at work! they fit well and i\\'m so happy with them! i am a 28 waist got size m, ,comfortable,fits grate,very appealing,color is good, picture is accurate....over all really nice pants as expected i\\'m less than 5.3 feet. no need to alter. fits as described in the product description. soft material. not washed yet. may need to do hand wash to keep it in good condition. pretty bright, fit me well as a medium ( i am size 10, 5\\'4&#34;) it fits me perfect. thank you love them! bought them for work. love them gift for my daughter.  fit well and she really liked it. that\\'s ok, excelent product, my wife was happy loooove these! absolutely perfect! xoxo😘🙈😝💕 this is a nice pair of capris but be careful when ordering, all of the main pictures for the item are white, but as you scroll over them the name of the color changes and a secondary thumbnail becomes available to view. when your item goes into your cart it does not specify what color you purchased.<br />hopefully amazon will change this.<br />i thought i ordered white but pale blue showed up.<br />i was able to get a refund for them because vangood was incredibly helpful and amenable. i will definitely shop with again. they communicated quickly and the refund was received in under 24 hours.<br />thank you very much vangood!! and amazon! when i tried these on i was delighted.  i am 5\\'2&#34; and they didn\\'t drag the floor.  so if you\\'re tall, you may want to check the exact measurements prior to ordering.  aside from the length, they fit as expected and are very comfortable. i ordered several of these. fits true to size. comfortable to wear. in the summer, i clean condos and babysit for vacationing families.<br />perfect for agility! the pockets are nice on the top, and the 2 pockets on each side of the pant are convenient. i am a size 10-12 and a large fits perfect. i am 5\\'9&#34; and i had to order tall. holy cow these are comfy! and warm. and wonderful. i got them just in time for summer :( can\\'t wait for a cold winter so i can wear them all day. i wear anywhere from a size 2-5 in pants, i\\'m 5\\'7 120lbs.  i ordered the small and they fit wonderfully. great length and not too tight, not too baggy. as far as pants go, these were true to size and what i expected.  they fit well and are wearing well. i was a little concerned on the sizing when i ordered these pants. i took my chances and ordered size 6. when i received them i was very pleased on the look and how they fit me! i was so happy with them that i ordered two more pairs. i now have a black, coffee and khaki pair!! my khaki pair i\\'m using for gardening and they are much more comfortable than a pair of jeans. i would definitely recommend these pants to ally friends!! the quality of material is great as is the v-notched waist band that will work well with a crop-top or other style shirt.<br /><br />elegant pants that fit well and feel good on - would love them in brown and dark blue too! i said this fits as expected cause i expected it to fit snug. i ordered a size larger than i normally am based on the reviews and i\\'m glad i did! if you have a belly or a muffin top, you will definitely want to wear a shaper underneath or it will show any pudgy you have. that said though, it is very comfortable and looks good on. they are soft and well-made, especially for the price!  no problems after two washes (delicate/low heat).  they have more than met my lounge pants needs. very comfy but had to remove elastic in waistband, it was way too tight these are simply adorable and well worth the price.  i cannot wait to wear my long boyfriend shirt, and some fun black flats.  thank you so much for your prompt service. these are so comfortable. i haven\\'t taken them off yet! they\\'re the perfect fit, perfect length, everything. i\\'d recommend these to anyone. i have been buying koi scrubs for the past few years and love the brand because of their style and sleek look. i bought the lindsey pant in the skinny version (xxs) because i have twigs for legs and all scrub pants are way too baggy for me. i absolutely love these. they fit perfectly and my legs don\\'t get lost in them. i bought the black because as you know black goes with everything, but cat hair, lint and all kinds of fluffy things love these pants too. after several washes i did find that the fluff, hair and lint problem is not as bad. i plan on buying another few pairs of these in different colors. love the idea! would have liked the skirt a little longer as well as the leggings! looks nice with mid length sweater! they look great! order one size up though! so happy with the product and i got it way faster than i expected amazon has found the right partner.  this pair of pants was a delight.  the material is just a little bit thicker and so they hang well on the body.  they we delivered promptly, the exact thing that was ordered is what showed up and i have to say i love this company.  they do exchanges with no hassle, i\\'ve never had an order wrong, the delivery is standard but always within the time frame they publish and the product is always worth the money spent.  thank you amazon for finding them. fits small so order a size bigger.  great quality!!! these are sharp looking, and plain print can wear with many things. i bought these because i have a great butt and i like to showcase my assets.  these pants run a little long in my opinion, and also have a tendency to slip down in the back (that\\'s not how i want to show off my booty).  i own two pairs and will probably buy more...unless i find a better brand for the price. love, love, love them! great work out pants i love these pants! feels like i\\'m wearing jammies, but i look sexy as all get out. pairing these with a halter top and heels is the ticket. my only gripe is that the seam looks weak in the butt area and i\\'m afraid it\\'s gonna bust soon. if i\\'m honest, though, i\\'ve got a$$ on me. these babies are flattering. fit well but a little see through love these!!! comfortable fit. i\\'m buying more true to size. extremely comfortable and placement/size of pockets are perfect! i have friends asking about them, wanting a pair for themselves.  i\\'m not in the medical field, however, i do spend some time at a horse ranch on weekends to help with the property and horses, and these are very handy for the tasks. i\\'m also in florida, and these are still somewhat comfortable in temps well into the 90s (at least more so than jeans or cotton pants). i thought they were the shiny material, but they are not. also, size says 4 to 6 (which is usually too big for me) and they are perfect fit. just want to let you know they do run small. i have a hard time finding clothes that fit--usually a 1 or 2 and maybe a 3 will fit. i read the other reviews stating that they are see-through so i decided to only buy one pair to start.  well i just got these yesterday and they fit really good, i love that they are long length and they are not see-through.  yes the material is a little thin but it\\'s not so thin that they look cheap or anything.  they are true to size.  i will be ordering more pairs. they fit great, look good and so comfy....i have had a lot of compliments!<br />thanks! i\\'m a size 14/16 ordinarily. i usually wear a large in bottoms. after reading the reviews i purchased a 2x and the fit wonderfully. i got lots of complements on these. fits nice these are the greatest, most comfortable pants ever!! you can dress them up with heels or dress them down with flip-flops. i got this at a discount to review. these are silky light. more of a dress pant . pair with a great top for night time or a comfy top for every day. it really is flattering on. i do suggest wearing underwear that match the color you pick. they are kind of see through in areas. not a work pant for that reason. i really like them and think i will get some in the other colors. great deal and well made. so comfy and breathable! great for working out. i wear them under running shorts to prevent any chafing, they also wick sweat well even though they aren\\'t advertising that about them. over the moon happy about these, i\\'ve already ordered 4 more pairs!!! they are warm and soft,<br /><br />i was 5 feet 2 inches, 135 pounds, which is very suitable for me, but the pants is a bit long, but it is very comfortable, other shoppers told me these run small...these a perfect..i am a small, bought medium<br />wish i had remembered that when shopping for three more and ordered small.<br />i am dying in them...and finally figured out why....i didn\\'t buy a size up.  great item.. runs small, so order up ladies comfy pants but needed petit much too long as most things are on my 5\\'2 frame :-( love these pants. great fit and comfy. beautiful! love love love these! i wear them all the time. they go with practically everything! these are so unique. i love them. good material stronger than tights and the printing is really good.  if you are in to clothes that turn peoples heads these are for you. they also shipped fast so that\\'s a plus. the pants got to me in a short amount of time, which i was very happy about. i absolutely love these pants, however they do run a little large. other than that, they are awesome and ao comfortable! a little loose in the waist but otherwise well made, good cut. i love these! will definitely be ordering more of them. they are long enough for my height (5\\'10), very comfortable, and flattering. the material is a little thin, but i wear them if i need to run an errand and don\\'t feel like changing, and i am a pretty modest individual. definitely recommend! i received these around a day or two ago and i love them. i am around 110 pounds and 5\\' 6, i usually wear a large in leggings since i have a larger backside but these fit perfectly. i would say they\\'re a medium possibly. they\\'re great leggings with a nice pattern and the material is super soft. i suggest these to anyone who wants a good pair of durable leggings! very nice quality! excellent for hot weather!!! i wish there were more different colors. i couldn\\'t wait to get these babies on! seriously my favorite article of clothing ever! i wore them to a tattoo convention and got tons of compliments. they fit like a dream, i\\'m a size 6 about 5 ft 6 in tall. makes my butt look amazing, i paired it with a peachy loose top because black was to harsh and wore dr. marten boots. totally worth all $8, it\\'s a nerd-girl must have. cute and comfortable. was originally intended to be part of a tai chi uniform, until i realized it was a little &#34;thin.&#34;  but these make awesome pajama bottoms.  very silky feeling - truly feels like real silk to me.  lovely sheen. deep black color.  nice. so glad i got these. got two patterns. love the fit. if you are short...they are long. im 5\\'4, so perfect. the cotton ones that some vendors sell are shorter. inquire about length. comfortable, great to either workout in or as lounge wear. ordered and received in a week... love it and it comfortable to wear at home! while these are quite long (a nice change for me), they\\'re very comfy. i liked the idea of a higher waistband because nobody needs or wants to see the butt-crack of an older lady when she bends over. really cool design! i might just buy a second pair.<br /><br />be aware - fit is one-size-fits-most according to asian sizing. they look nice and baggy on american sizes s-m, but will look tight on l-xl women.<br /><br />the white symbols on the pants start to crack easily, especially at stress-points (across the butt) so take care to wash inside out. excellent fit! love the style! these are great capris. the fit is perfect and they are thin for summer which i love here in the hot, humid south. great to wear, comfy but loses integrity in waist. the elasticity isn\\'t strict to maintain high waist without belt after few uses. perfect fit, love these. stretch is just right and doesn\\'t bind. want in every color. these are just great pants. my ex said they looked baggy on me but i don\\'t care. he didn\\'t like them but you know what? he\\'s not as comforting as a pair of good sweats are. they\\'re not that great to work out in but they\\'re super awesome as pajama pants or to wear around the house. finding pants for me is always a hassle being that i have a big rear and a smaller waist. i\\'m 5\\'2 and 171 pounds and usually wear a 10 or 12 in jeans depending on the cut. with dress pants i end up with pants that are either tight and give me a camel toe, when i sit i look like a plumber and a muffin top or they are super loose, i hardly ever find something in between until i found these! they fit great! they hug each curve just right. i went out last night and got a lot of compliments with these. the material is super smooth and stretchy and feel great against your skin. the seems are sewn wonderfully. the length was a smidge long but heels fixed that (i\\'m 5\\'2 so that is always a problem). i purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review however i will be buying more of these at full price!! feel great on and look great buy this if you want:<br />-comfort<br />-warmth<br />-flexibility<br /><br />i am about 5\\'2 with average legs. these pants are on the slightly long side, if i were 5\\'4 they would probably perfectly fit. it\\'s not a problem for me though because as long as i wear shoes the cuff is kept off the ground although i think i will try to hem it up an inch or two later. overall they are very comfortable. a plus side i think is that they are pretty warm and although they are thin, the wind doesn\\'t pass much through them to chill my legs in 35 degree weather. shorts look amazing on my wife and they make her ass look super sexy.... i usually have trouble with length  (legs are long) but these are perfect! use the size chart, it worked for me. great looking pants! i only wore them once and they fit great! lost weight so they wont fit next year! i will have to sell them back! my favorite jammie bottoms of all i have. great fit i got a a small and im 95 lb and its perfect best jeans ever!! was pleasantly surprised by this, expected it to be worse, but satisfied love this capir fit as expected great pants love them! i absolutely love these pants.  linen is one of my favorite fabrics, and these are wonderfully soft.  i ordered 2 pair and will now order more colors.  the fold over waist band is gentle against the mid-section - a must for folks like me who are a bit thick in the waist.  admittedly, the knit waist band could be more sturdy, but that is a minor point considering the comfort and chic look. a little see through but otherwise perfect. i ordered a large after reading the reviews because normally i am a medium. i really think i would have be fine either way med or lrg yoga pants are stretchy. awesome quality ancle is a bit large arrived on time. opened the pkg and tried them on. they feel and fit like a dream. i love them!! i\\'m getting a second pair for sure! i typically don\\'t wear colored pants, but for the price, i figured i would give these a try. i like the skinny fit because it has a more modern/stylish look to it and looks great as a summer outfit with sandals or heels.<br />i\\'ve found that i can pretty much pair it with any color of tank top or tee and it looks nice. my favorite colors to pair with it are blue and black. i have a handkerchief style tunic that i just got that is blue with fringe and it accents really nicely with the yellow jeans.<br />i love the way these silver suki\\'s fit. they\\'re very comfortable to wear throughout the entire day and i don\\'t have to worry about them shrinking in the dryer either.<br />i have really enjoyed wearing these yellow jeans to get me out of my comfort zone and into something new besides denim! love them soft color doesn\\'t fade. except if you don\\'t wash them with jeans or heavy clothes its makes little fuzz balls form on them. excellent quality<br />excellent service<br />the petite size was exact, and the quality of the material is excellent<br />i would recommend this product so soft and yummy to wear. first time i washed there was no problems with running dye and they kept their shape and form through washing. wish the price wasn\\'t as costly, but all hatley designs are clever and cute to wear for the whole family. i was looking to replace a pair of leggings i owned.  specifically wanted black with some added decoration on the sides.  the old ones had eyelets, so these are not quite the same, but will serve the purpose of the comfort of leggings with dressy buttons so i can add a frilly top and wear out on the town.  these are made of thinner material so i question their durability, but i will take what i can get with the styling. comfy, cute and definitely a conversation starter haha they fit perfectly and are well made.  i would recommend them to all my friends for quality and for fit. i love my new leggings! they came much much quicker than i thought they would and i got a nice note from the seller! good quality, even better price, 5 stars all the way around. loved the quality and service just love it! very pleased well i definitely hesitated ordering these back when it only had 3 stars and while it was in transit a few more reviews popped up making the overall rating 2 stars and i started to panic a bit, but i just got them in the mail this morning and thankfully am here to report nothing but good things.<br /><br />material: great. it\\'s nice and thick so it holds you in, and feels a lot like dry-fit workout tights.<br />print: nice. a little thicker than what it shown on the stock photos, but nothing i\\'d really complain about.<br /><br />now about me: 5\\'7&#34;, athletic 130lbs. the thigh bones almost, almost go past my thighs, but luckily stops right before the curve.<br />i\\'m usually a size 1 in junior jeans, a size 26 in women\\'s, and an overall size 2<br />i suppose if you fall within a similar category, you will find yourself pleasantly surprised with these tights. these pants are incredibly flattering and have a thick, forgiving ponte fabric that looks great on people with a pear-shaped body, which is to say a larger booty and thigh region. however, you should be aware that they run very large. i would definitely order a size down if you like your pants comfortably loose, and two sizes down if you like your pants tight. that said, the design, stitching, fabric choice, and quality are all excellent and i would definitely recommend these pants, as long as you can size down to achieve the perfect sizing. i received a sample for review, but the opinions are my own. i love these pants. they are comfortable and can be either dressed up or casual wear. very comfortable, still wearing my koi scrubs that are 8 yrs old. i\\'m a rn..scrubs never go out of style, but updated as this scrub pant was. i have so many koi scrub outfits,  that i have started wearing black, white & brown pants outside of the work place. i don\\'t know how i lived without wearing a pair of these! they were slightly too large so order smaller than usual. i don\\'t own this but i\\'m thinking this and some cute leggings  and pumps or wedges👌😍 love these, so cute and comfy. wish i could get more!!!!! very bright and sporty. love the colors and fit. perfect for my upcoming cruise. bright colors, but not too bright. can be dressed up or down. love these pants!! comfy and stylish!! i love these pants. have them in many colors. love it…fits well even though i am tall 5\\'10&#34;…i think it is very cute and will be a great addition to my summer pants!! so comfortable these are the cutest things i own:) i don\\'t know what the other people are talking about when they say they are too thin or short they fit me <3, i\\'m only 5 foot 1 though. the material is crazy soft and they\\'re intensely comfortable. i love these. shipping took a while but they\\'re shipping from china(which i find ironic) i wanted to get these before my birthday and i did! i got them today(april 11th) and my birthday is on the 20th. theyre worth the wait:) these pants are very comfortable and well made. i\\'ve swam and snorkeled in these and they have not given me any discomfort. i actually don\\'t realize that i wearing them. no drag at all. they dry very fast too. love them! i\\'m wearing them right now they are comfortable and look cute, i gave it a 4 star only because the material is a bit thin but besides that they are great. fits me well! i\\'m 4\\'10&#34; and the small fit me perfectly. super comfortable pants!  with the color range these pants are versatile and can easily transition from day wear to evening wear. i bit snug on thigh area so not suitable for yoga open leg poses. overall love the color. fit great and comfortable fit is super comfortable and looks great on!  i can\\'t wait to order more colors. my daughter liked it. i bought it larger. she is quite slim but made sure i left room for shrinkage, as they are 100% cotton. this pants are very nice and beautifull, i like them a little bit loose, but they are ok. thanks for everythin love these pants. they are like fancy sweats that you can dress up or down. they fit great & are nice quality. i bought the shirt that they recommended getting with them & it is great as well. great price! perfect fit, comfortable to wear, nice print. great product we miscalculated the size. i think my wife will order another bigger. i was spittle skeptical at first when buying these but  they fit great .i\\'m 5.6 this item was shipped in a great time. was in perfect condition. needed for christmas but i ordered late but go here fast as could coming from hong kong. the size was a little small but shipper worked great with me to help fix problem. great shipper. these are great . good fabric nice color loose fitting i recommend these you will love wearing them to i usually don\\'t wear brown... this is my only pair.  they fit just right as the size i expected! great!!!! super comfortable--although after reading reviews-i erred on the side of caution & got medium although i\\'m 5\\'4 and 100# & a small in everything. i could probably wear a small, but these are comfortable. nothing to say about this, i just love it and is so comfortable!  really liked it and always wear it at my ballet classes i need to get more of these. i havent worn jeans in ages since i discovered these comfy pants. i love the fold-over splash of color. gorgeous! very beautiful light blue color with excellent quality! this is my first pair of ski pants and i am into it! i get many compliments on the color of my green jeggings. comfy and not so stretchy top panel that means i can wear it even now at 6 mos post baby and back to normal size. these are very light weight but nice for lounging or neighborhood walks when too cold for shorts. i personally dont like the way that these fit on me.... but they are.extremly comfy and soft. i have ordered the 2-pack of grey and black leggings twice, and i love them. the grey ones feel like compression pants, but the black ones don\\'t fit as well. they are a little bit more loose around the knees.the material is nice and thick and not see-though. i pretty much ordered them again for the grey ones. they are super comfy, and look good on. i think they\\'re of good value for the price. i love these pants and will be wearing them all the time around the home.  they are made of rayon, so they are thin and are certainly intended for home wear or even hosting a party. the fabric is sturdy even though it is thin and the fit is perfect. and, importantly to me, they are made in usa. i love these! i love these leggings! just fun to wear, and easy to put together. very unique, and  made my day! received many compliments, and just enjoy wearing them. i need to find a  nice oversize white top for them. today figuring out clothes sizes is a challenge.  in most clothing, with the exception of workout clothing, larges are larger.  these pants follow this rule and are smaller than expected for size large.  i wear 12 jeans and medium scrub pants but should have ordered xl in these yoga pants. good wonderful!  i love these pants.  they have tiny little pockets under the funny front flap that adds a lot of flair, and i love the way the pants fall at the ankle, not too long, not too short -- i am 5\\'4&#34; and have a 28 inch inseam, and these pants almost come to my ankles.  they ride up the ankle as i walk which is something i like but it could be distracting or bug people.  i like the way the pants are very flow-y.  they give me weight -- i am 118 lbs and trying to gain, so i look for clothing that adds bulk to my body.  i don\\'t like it when people start saying i should gain weight!  these pants help!  they are quite full!  they are elastic waisted, and often feel as if they will fall down, but on a larger waisted person they\\'d be fine.  the fabric is a bit rough like linen should be, and i like that and feel it will hold up.  i have washed them several times and don\\'t bother to iron them and they are fine.  they are easy to wear and interesting -- you will be looked at -- they are not run-of-the-mill.  they are not corporate.  they are strange, and for that i love them. fast shipping and handling. beautiful! i\\'m 4\\'11 110lbs. little bit long, just a bit. but still looks awesome. vibrant colors great pants for working from home, doing yoga, playing with the dog, and watching movies. easy to care for and last a long time. i use my hatleys hard -- i use them as scrubs and because i have pets and livestock my comfy pants get a lot of wear and hard use. hatleys are cute and comfortable and durable. great pants. i will be buying more. they are comfortable and they fit as expected. i am pleased with them great price, good quality image, and good fit. i got lots of compliments on these leggings! runs small.. purchased these for my daughter who is studying exercise science & physiology in school.  love the concept and hope she likes them! did not open the package before shipping off to her but item did arrive sooner than expected. appreciate the prompt delivery! these make nice tights - if you\\'re into the bling on the legs.  i was hoping these would work as leggings, but they are too thin.  they fit me just fine - i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; 120lbs.  i do wish the rhinestones on the sides were just silver - as-is they are a bit too blingy for my taste, but not unwearable.  but the general look and fit is nice, so as long as you know what to expect these are a good product. these pants are great as the maternity spandex isn\\'t too tight and the fit is great. the only reason it doesn\\'t have 5 stars is that after wearing the pants for just one day, it stretches out making the pants baggier than the regular fit. out of the wash it fits great and they are super cute for maternity wear :) these are very nice.  i am 5\\' 3&#34; and the length is good.  seem to be good quality. update: i bought three pair of these pants.  the first and third pair fit very well, with  no length issues.  the &#34;second&#34; pair was about 4 inches too long.  i found this very strange.  i did not want to &#34;cut&#34; the bottoms as they were hemmed so back they went. if you can find ones that have the correct length for you, i highly recommend these pants. i got these way before the estimated arrival date and am not disappointed unlike manycother reviews these were not see through for me. comfy when i bought these, the only review listed was scary; but, for me, these pants are near perfect.  i\\'m 5\\'10&#34; tall, and my weight fluctuates between 180 and 220.  hard to admit, but true.  since i am a teacher, i need comfy pants that have pockets.  since i\\'m tall, i need pants with extra length.  since i gain and lose weight, i like pants with some ability to be worn through a size or two difference (stretch.)  since i\\'m busy, busy, busy, i like pants that don\\'t require ironing.  these are awesome!  recently, i ordered pants again; but i mistakenly ordered the ones without pockets.  i wish i\\'d gone with these.  if there\\'s one teensy, weency thing that could be improved, it would be the weight of the fabric.  it\\'s not bad.  i\\'d say it\\'s a medium weight, but i\\'d prefer a heavier weight knit if it were possible. these are great pants for summer- cool and comfortable but also serve for casual professional setting! to give you an idea on sizing: i am 5ft4 and a half and weigh 115 pounds. the pants fit me well and hems touch the floor. the only mild problem that i have is the hip and back strings do not stay exactly were they are supposed to... they keep falling down. that is an easy enough fix since i know how to sew, i can just shorten them a little and tack them back in place. i am not wild about the big &#34;jewels&#34; on the pants either, but it\\'s not that bad. overall a good buy, worth the money. :) love them;) these pants are sooo cute and the fit is just perfect!  for the price, i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these jeans. it\\'s well made. the material is soft and has a bit of stretch so it is very figure flattering.  the seller is great. i got it in no time. very good product i think everyone should get these denim ruched crop leggings; they are just plain fun to wear and they look amazing. great product! the fabric was good quality thicker than expected with good fit love these! they came on time and fit just as i wanted them too! the color is right on and vibrant. very crisp and clean looking. these will be perfect for my birthday outfit with a crop top and some heels! i like i bought the ink black and came back to order the espresso. granted, the color wasn\\'t exactly as pictured (ink black was more bluish-gray), but i thought that the fit and quality were great. i keep looking for them to add more colors! these pants are awesome!  i had a hard time debating whether to order large or x-large because past experiences with clothes from china was that they come smaller than they say.  according to the chart the right size for me would be large, but i took a chance and ordered x-large.  the x-large are a little loose on me and fit more like a 12/14.  i wear 10/12 normally.  i would rather have them a little too big than a little too small, so i\\'m so happy i ordered one size up.<br />i wished they fit lower on the hips (they hit more around the waist), but i still love them.  they are a relaxed fit and length is perfect for me; i have a 32 inseam. i have never been able to find boy shorts bottom that work for me.  lo and behold, these fit perfectly!  i bought these with the tankini top to do laps in the pool, will serve the same purpose as a one piece but then i can go to the outdoor pool, change into the bikini bottom to sun and relax, then change into the beach pants to go home.  perfect.  prices were very reasonable by today\\'s standards for swimwear!  let\\'s see if the fabric lasts through the season, but right now very happy with my purchase. i love these so much!!!! medium fits a 6. best quality jogger ever!!! can you please get the wine burgandy color in a medium??? i am 5\\'2&#34; so these pants are pretty long on me. i ordered a small and by the end of the day i am constantly pulling them up. however, i ordered them in black too. they are soooo comfy and cute to dress up with flats or sandals. perfect fit! great quality. i just love these pants! nice these are not forgiving in the thigh, butt areas.  i would say go with a darker color if you are wanting a more flattering look! another great pant from ellazhu.  i can\\'t say it enough...they\\'re the best!  and best delivery time ever! very comfortable yoga scrub pants are the best invention........... comes with belt like it! love these scrubs. very comfortable and light. i live in florida and the summer is unbearable sometimes between the heat & humidity. the material is very light. comfortable to wear here. when you order remember that they are &#34;unisex&#34; so they run large. i think it would be safe to go down one size on these scrubs stylish and well made but way too small.  make it bigger and i\\'ll buy another. the material in these yoga pants isn\\'t as heavy, water wicking, or form fitting as others i have. the material is a little thinner, softer and very comfortable.  i hope they hold up well with washing - haven\\'t seemed to stretch out too much. i love these pants. i was hesitant about the style, but now they are my favorite pants. daughter loves them! these are awesome. my daughter noticed that the symbols from the show supernatural are on them, even the devil\\'s trap. not demonic either. actual old catholic religious symbols. very cool indeed. daughter loves the fit. i think they\\'re cute and they fit well. i bit large good item these scrubs fit as the description states, a little large. i ordered a small and i usually wear an extra small. the material isn\\'t the softest but it\\'s not terrible. i would buy these scrubs again. you really can\\'t beat the price! very comfortable. got lots of compliments! they work for men too!  even though it does show off how tiny my privates are, i highly recommend this product! i think the pants are fantastic.  i admit they are long, but i just throw on some high heeled boots and they look very fashionable.  i definitely can not afford haute couture, so these pants are like a great consolation prize!  they fit very well, and i definitely don\\'t have a runway figure! i like the way these pants fit on me. its very comfortable and looks nice with a blazer. these really fit well and seem to be made well.  they are soft and the color is very nice!  i am tall (5\\'9&#34;) and the length is fine on me. agree that it is nothing like the picture. basically straight leg pants of some soft stretchy material. i am petite and just covers my ankles. will do as formal pants but also so comfortable. i might just wear it all the time. the band is wide and very comfortable. my usual pregnancy size is small and it fits well very nice quality! these pants are the perfect length and the fit is excellent. very comfortable to wear to the gym or for a run. this is my favorite bra.  ever.  i\\'m small and don\\'t need a lot of support, just good coverage.  this bra is wireless, has the perfect support, it\\'s totally comfortable and fits under just about everything i wear.  it\\'s not available on amazon anymore....or anywhere else either.  (i have searched and searched!)  i love this bra so much that when i found it on a small boutique website in my size, i paid top dollar, plus paid $18 to ship it, because i had to have it.  i don\\'t know what i\\'ll do when this one wears out....the word distraught comes to mind!  ;)  i hope wacoal brings this one back! i\\'m 5\\'7&#34; and 116 pounds i thought it might be too short but it fit perfectly. i ordered a light gray in small :) and the material is nice very comfy these leggings are great if you are the right height! i\\'m 5\\' feet tall and have short legs so if you look like the model or around her height it would be perfect! i really like the material. it doesn\\'t make you feel too hot and its somewhat fleece-lined so it\\'ll keep you warm during the fall. love it! beautiful slacks, a little long for a petite, i will have to hem before i wear them, but they are worth the effort. great fit and super cute. i\\'m 5\\' 2&#34; and these are a little long but i figured they would be. i love how they fit. great for wearing everyday or out for a date. very nice. not as thick of material as i expected but are excellent for going to church or work the sheer pants were lightt and flowey perfect fit and sexy looks exactly like the picture. ordered the fuchsia in a size 9, just received them today and they fit perfect! these pants are great!!! they are very comfortable and stylish.  i\\'m 5\\'1 so if you are short, buy a size smaller and wear heels or wedges.  i have gotten several compliments in the style of the pant.  great buy!!!! so yeah, they do run a bit small, but not too bad. they are very long though, had to get mine altered. but now i love them! they are super soft and flowy. can dress them up or down. i have worn them a tankini top and beachy floppy hat during the day, and put on a flowy top and heels with them at night. would buy them again. super comfortable and perfect for the summer. the fabric is really nice. has good weight to it, while managing to not make me feel hot.<br />the drawstring has to be tied like a slipknot, or 1/2 bow. very good purchase. i normally wear size 10 bottoms & medium tops. the bottoms were just  a bit too tight in the butt area & the top fit fine. the quality seemed fine although there is no stretch at all in the fabric (personal preference) they do fit, just a little more snug then i wanted. but they\\'ll work great pants for work. wear well, wash and dry then ready to wear. will be ordering ither colors as needed! they fit perfectly! i like the material is great, and it fits as expected. their customer service is even better. even though my sister went off to college already, and wanted to return them, the company helped me figure out a solution. thank you excellent i love these pants and now have 4 different ones! they are a good buy and really comfortable!!!  you can use them year round since they are so light.  i love them.  they are very flattering!! i like these pants. they\\'re extremely comfortable and they actually fit, even being asian made. i got the xl and am 5\\'8&#34; and a size 18 american women\\'s pants. they aren\\'t extremely stretchy in the waist though; even so i recommend these! very comfy and work great for the summer sleeveless shirts you can purchase.  i\\'m happy i bought them. love it i cannot rave enough. buy these pants here! you could go to a country store in your area that sells the wild print palazzo pants and pay $50+. these pants are well made, love the print and material and price! must buy. will buy again! after reading previous reviews, i thought the pants weren\\'t going to fit, but they do. they aren\\'t too tight, or too loose. the waist is a little loose, but it isn\\'t a big deal because that\\'s usually the case with any pair of pants i wear. they don\\'t really scream &#34;harem pants,&#34; but fitted pants with pockets.  i love how they are loose around around my hips/rear, but more fitted everywhere else. i ordered size small/medium. i\\'m 5\\'4&#34;, pear-shaped, and weigh 125lbs.  the print is bold, so if you aren\\'t into bright colors or attracting attention, don\\'t order these. scrubs have improved since i worked as a nurse 10 yes ago. these are soft and comfy. i will buy more. i bought talk because i was afraid of being too short...i am 5\\'7\\'\\'. i probably could have gotten regular. but they will be fine. i will buy these again they were the right size and everything but there is a problem with them. maybe it was just the pair i was sent but they were cut wrong. it was stretchy length wise andnot width wise. these would be absolutely amazing if they were cut right and stretched in the right places ( like the hips) they arrived on time and were waiting on my front step when i got home. when i opened the package i was surprised to find they came in their own cute little carry bag.<br /><br />this pants are made out of a great material that is thin and soft so perfect for summer. i am 5\\'9 with very long legs so they are capri lenght, but i love the look. i will be ordering another pair. love love love these. pants are well made, very comfortable, nice material.  wish they came in a longer length.  product arrived much quicker than the stated delivery date. i really like the jeans, but the size was too big for me. had to return the item. i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; so the pants are a little long but they are so comfortable i love them. you can dress them down with a sweatshirt for comfy day off clothes or dress them up with a nice shirt for a night out at the bar. i like it so much grey\\'s scrubs always the best!! i\\'m 5\\'4 and the petite length is perfect! super cute and light.  the fit is great and stretchy for those days you want to be comfy.  no problems with the fit. very nice very short but fits fine at the waist fits as expected good fabrics i love this product , it was what i expected i am size 16-18 and purchased an xxl. they fit very comfortably! i love these pants. the color was a little more deep blue than i expected it to be, but very close to the one pictured. they\\'re amazingly comfortable and stylish. i only ever wear aladdin/harem pants; once i got my first pair i never went back to jeans. i suggest to machine or hand wash these and then hang dry them, as the heat and cycle in a machine dryer is too harsh on the material and the fabric beads over time. these pants are great for lazy days! cute they are really stylish and cute, can\\'t wait to where them out. they fit just right. these are nice pants but i just didn\\'t like the way they fit me.  i am hard to fit!! very cute, fits great!! i wear this all the time, i love how it looks and feels, got lots of compliments, looks awesome with boots, very rock and roll. and freaking cheap i really like them they fit good feels good against the skin. like the fit very nice. i ordered the light pink pants expecting them to be super pastel, but they\\'re darker than in the picture. they fit nicely though. the material is comfortable. love this outfit.  i\\'ve washed my set 3 times and it still looks like new.  plan to order another color or two.  seems to run slightly large but very comfortable and holds up well. i ended up having to exchange my pants for a larger size.  that was my fault.  i paid to ship them back and the company was great about shipping me a new pair.  i was very pleased with their service.  the pants are a little lighter material than the donnkenny pants i have from 10 years ago.  hopefully they will hold up as while as those have.  definitely a nice pair of slacks for work. i am happy the pant is great, it  is  comfortabe and  fitting for me .it make me very slim.it\\'s a good material. thank you leveret. bought it for my wife... she loves it! love these pants! they can be worn for casual or dressed up. i wore them with a fun black shirt and some bling to a wedding reception. i ordered these pants in paradise pink, along with 2 pairs of billabong pants that i\\'m returning because they run small. instead of futzing around i bought 2 more of these in other colors. they handle the washer and dryer beautifully. i love these leggings!  i am a size us 12, about 5\\'8&#34; 160 lbs (would like to lose a few!).  i usually wear about a 33 or 34 &#34; inseam in jeans.  these fit me perfectly, and i think they would fit someone larger as well.  they don\\'t become see-through when they stretch, and the fabric is very soft and comfortable.  i have received many compliments on the pretty paisley pattern as well! this was a little large when i first ordered it, but now that i gained a little weight i fit comfortably in it. i will be buying more. products of excellent quality, i am very satisfied! buy more. great! not a fan of the triangular panty-looking line, but these pants fit so comfortably and look so regal. so, after reading all the reviews about these &#34;shorts&#34;, i decided to order up a couple of sizes. i normally wear a women\\'s small in bike shorts and the like. reading the reviews, it seemed like these shorts would be something akin to doll clothing, size-wise. hence, i ordered the x-large. well, they were waaaaaaay too big. i am 5\\'3&#34;, about 115 lbs. i\\'m thinking that the medium is my next option since i coulda fit another person in the xl!  oh, and they smell funny when taken out of the packaging. i\\'m sure that would go away once they were washed but it\\'s a pretty strong odor. the padding did seem more than adequate, which is what i was looking for for an upcoming mountain biking vacation. will probably re-order but doubt i\\'ll receive them in time for the trip. nice quality.  not as warm as i expected, but i like them. these pants or sweat pants are just like they look. they are not to tight, and they are real comfortable. they look cute you can wear them out as part of an outfit or as workout sweats. i have cat and they do catch the hair. so i wear them for workout outside the home. i\\'m 5\\'1&#34; and weight about 100ils. deside for yourself. i really like the way they fit makes me feel all snuggly... i think im ordering another one for just lounging in the fall and winter....these are very flattering too... perfect! good price and good fit! the quality looks great ... i bought these for my niece, i hope she  like them ... nirnimour shipped them way before scheduled time  i can appreciates that since her birthday is coming up soon ... thanks again ... perfect tights for wear on a nice evening or to the gym.. i love these pants!  i think they may be the tiniest bit see-through, but they\\'re not bad.  i\\'m 5\\'6&#34;, 155 lb and i got the medium.  i\\'m also happy that they are long enough and the fold over part on top fits nicely. these are wonderful!  i love how they fit, the material is very soft and light without being see-through... love them!  i will be purchasing more! excellent i now own 6 of these in different colors. i am 5&#34;1&#34; 105 lbs and they fit perfectly.  they wear well, don\\'t bag at the knee. i machine wash in cold water and hang to dry. so glad i found these! best product ever love it thankssssss they are very cute and size is a little big for a small but i\\'m 5\\'3 athletic 125 pounds so if your smaller than me they might be to big .... i like them a lot these are super soft and comfortable.  i really like them.  i wish they would be a little cheaper, but you can\\'t have everything in life. i love the way it fits... its so pretty..  i totally recommend this outfit....it\\'s so pretty....you can wear it dressy or casual. just love these pants the length the pockets. it feels good on.<br />the color is amazing bought to wear underneath a bathing suit.  i really like it and it makes my time in public in a bathing suit much more tolerable as i\\'m a big girl and absolutely hate having my thighs exposed. functional form and comfort...these pants are more comfortable with every washing. my wife just loves this clothing line and i think she looks great in them. these pants are perfect!  the material is very exercise friendly, i got them for belly dancing.  the wide leg is beautiful!  they are low-cut and i can roll them lower if i need to without them looking strange.  added bonus: they make my butt look super-cute and perky!  love them!  i\\'m 5\\'7\\\\\\\\\" and got a large size, they are a bit long but not so long that i will trip on them when i dance.  they would look awesome with a great pair of heels on a night out! i gave a four because i have not washed them yet. i would score them a 5 because they fit perfect , very comfy.<br />  i am 5&#34;9 and 170lb, i wore them without rolling the waist down because of my size, which worked well.<br />the pants look cleac and classy. hot as hell on my ass. amy went with the recommendations from previous reviewers to order a size up, i\\'m a 12 and the 14 fits comfortably. seams and stitching look good, fabric is very lightweight (heads up, the white is very sheer). my only complaint is they don\\'t come in more colors! excellent fabric!!!!! cool fitting . very comfortable and styles as expected ... very happy this is the third pembrook item i have purchased and love them all.  the fabric is soft and stretches for all day comfort.  it washes well and the embroidery gives it a high class look at a great price!  i will ordering more colors of this item and the long sleeve fleece set for cooler weather.  i couldn\\'t be happier. they are so comfy... love them. but with that being said i don\\'t believe these are one size fits all because there is a lot of extra leg room in them! nice pants but again no pockets.  i will have to watch the next order and make sure the pants have pockets after reading the reviews i went ahead and got a size larger. i am normally a large but got an xl. everything fit me just right. i am 5\\'2 so the pants were just the right length. the material was very thin and the stitching looked like it wouldn\\'t hold up long. but only time will tell. but overall scrubs are cute. price is reasonable and shipping was early. comfortable and seem well made these are one of my favorites to wear love, love, love ... so comfortable and just what i was looking for, for summer. these pants fit great and are so comfortable, not too long either like some of these pants can be. i loved all of the pattern options too. plus they are light enough for the summer too! it looks great and fits great and it\\'s comfortable. only that the fabric is a little too thin. wife loves these pants i love them, but they are a little big i need a x small i purchased these bib overalls for my married daughter.  she gardens and works in the yard all the time, and i knew these would go over big with her.  the fit was good in a size small, as she usually wears a 4/6..  the denim is a good sturdy type that will work well for gardening.  overall we\\'re pleased with the product. they are a bit tighter than i thought they would be. however, they were a gift for a friend and i\\'m hoping that they\\'ll still work out for her. the color is great!! yes these are perfect awesome. nice pockets that can actually hold things, and when it stretches when you wear them you can\\'t see through them they are perfect for those cool evenings they\\'re stretchy, so they do fit, even though they were tighter than i had hoped; they are very comfortable however. i received these very fast and tried them on immediately. they are very comfortable and not see-through like some people said. they have a good thickness to them, not super thin. they seem to be made of a very good material. all in all i would recommend to buy these when you are looking for comfortable cute yoga pants. the sizes run a little small but the fabric is so stretchy that it doesn\\'t really matter. the waistband doesn\\'t really want to stay in place but overall they are good leggings. i just bought another pair in a larger size. sexy i have a pair of navy alfred dunner slacks that i purchased at a local store.  they are petite short and are too short( but i wear them anyway) so i ordered petite medium hoping for a better fit.  these are too long.  having tried the petite short and now the petite medium without a decent fit, i will have to hem the petite mediums to get a better fit.  the slacks are comfortable and exactly what i want in slacks except for the length.  i have not washed them yet but i expect them to wash as well as my other pair.  i am 5\\'2&#34; so keep that in mind when ordering slacks for yourself. as expected. very warm and comfortable. the camo color is awesome. my wife loves them, she wears them all the time. highly recommend these for husbands who have wives that like to lounge and watch football all day... fit great, almost a tad big, soft and flowy, looove them i want a dozen i have several pairs of these jeans and love how they fit.  i usually buy style 400d. i find that they are true to size--you can\\'t order 1 size smaller.  my weight usually varies between 125 to 129 lbs.  i order a size 12.  i can wear a size 8 to 10 in department stores (since the industry has adjusted the stated size to make people feel better).  when i ordered a different style of nydj jeans, i ordered size 12 and they were huge.  hope this helps! love it love these pants and will purchase more in different colors.  mahalo love these and they are long enough for me to wear a small heal.  i\\'m 5\\'8 nice nice nice returned for larger size. the fabric does not give much. but really nice! i am only 5\\' tall, so finding &#34;petite&#34; pants that really are petite is not easy. these pants are a perfect length for me. and a perfect fit. nydj pants are expensive, but if there\\'s a size that works for you, they are consistent across the product line so you can buy additional pants without worry. though cut like their jeans, the material on these pants is thinner and a bit dressier than the jeans - they would be fine for work or a dinner out. exactly as pictured and described.  super comfy. i love these! they fit perfectly and are so stylish! :) i am very pleased! i just wore these pants for the first time.  i\\'m currently 5 months pregnant.  i\\'ve got a bump, but it\\'s not too large yet.  the pants fit a little loose right now, but should be perfect in another month or so.  they are really cute on, and are really comfortable. i got these free for review and they are amazing! they fit wonderfully and look amazing. the fabric feels amazing on the skin and the black color makes my lower half look slimmer. i\\'m a mother of two and these pants make it almost effortless for me to feel like i\\'m more dressed up than i really am, all while feeling incredibly comfortable. loved the color. these jeans are so pretty, just love them. very satisfied with my purchase. wife says: smooth fit - even though it\\'s unlined, it\\'s made of a nice thick synthetic so it smooths everything over. reminds me of the nyc skater pants i bought in college. i feel that sexy in them now. size 16 fits as expected. length is about 33&#34;, so will be having this hemmed.<br /><br />the little detail on the pocket with the criss cross fabric is lovely and makes the pants special.<br /><br />the teal color is vibrant and accurate to the photo. the olive color is a more vibrant and rich, dark olive green than the picture conveys (in the photo it looks almost gray and drab).<br /><br />can\\'t wait to wear these to work, then out at night! decent enough to order a few more pairs for work. wow. these feel great. i was a little sad when my new job informed me that i would have to wear navy scrubs everyday. but i just tried these on and they are actually cute. and i never thought i would feel that way in scrubs. love these, fit is perfect size, no need to up or down size anything. i ordered another pair thats how much i love these pants. goes great with flats. relax fit on waist, good design on material & style goes great with heel or flats. they are perfect. i\\'m 5\\'8 and 120lbs fits amazingly. exactly what i ordered. definitely recomend. great pants, wish they didn\\'t have a drawstring, but i love them anyway. great colors. but it\\'s a little small and i\\'m an extra small. i did not now if they woukld be too big or not, but they fit just perfect and i will buy more.tonight i wear them out on the town, they are that snazzy!! love them! thanks. really cute. incredibly soft material. i took the advise of other reviews (thank you reviewers) i normally where a 4p i purchased these in a large.<br />they fit me perfectly, i have no room to add a few pounds so i am confused that the large fit me.<br />obviously they run very small.<br />they are very nice if you can wear them, they were about 2 inches long but no big deal i just added elastic in the hem and they are fine.<br />not often as a short person that i can actually order clothing online and have it work out for me.<br />and i owe that thanks to the reviewers. they got here very quickly. i use them for work. they are a little on the long side but my tennis shoes have a high sole, so no problem to work in. i would recommend them. my absolute favorite scrubs! these are soft, comfortable, fit perfectly, wash perfectly, and don\\'t feel cheap or too thin when worn. yes, they\\'re a little pricier than some other brands, but they\\'re well worth it. the waist doesn\\'t ride down when i bend over, either. if you\\'re required to wear pajamas (scrubs) to work, why not buy some that have the comfort of pjs but the quality and look of nicer clothing? a+ fit great, but fabric is think. love it! they are so comfortable. they do stretch a little at the waist but not to much. i will buy again! i purchased the pair called &#34;bohemian color abstract,&#34; and absolutely love them!  i\\'ve gotten numerous compliments on the fun colors and pattern, quite a deviation from the more conservative attire in my workplace.  these were the perfect length, are incredibly comfortable, and are easy to pair with virtually any solid color shirt.  love, love!! love it, love them! these pants do fit kinda small - i normally take a small or medium and after reading other reviews decided to take a medium and they fit perfect. they are linen so they stretch quickly. the linen is light and cool so ideal for if you want to wear pants on a warm summer day. will probably purchase more in a different color. it\\'s ok the quality these are my new favorite summer wear. i\\'ve already got two pairs and plan on getting other colors. they are wonderful - well made, fit perfectly and i love the wide elastic waistband. the ties at the waist seem redundant but then i\\'m pretty sure there\\'s no chance the pants will ever drop below my butt so i don\\'t have to worry. other slimmer folk my need to use them. i finally found a perfect fit and nice pants for me.. and the best thing about it is that it won\\'t break your bank.. i love the fact that it\\'s so stretchy and the color is vibrant. i got a red one btw.. definitely gonna buy more from this seller! perfect. and soooooooooo comfy. my 16 year old grand daughter is a dallas fan and she loves anything from victoria secrets.  she opened her gift at a breakfast gathering and went into the bathroom to put them on.  i think it may be one of her favorites this year. these are super comfy and now that i am expecting, i\\'m even happier i purchased them. these do pill a little but not horribly. these. pants. are. the. best. i say this while i am wearing these. ha. really comft. easy to dance in. most of the reviews state these pants run very small. i am 5.3 and weigh 110 pounds so i ordered a medium and hoped for the best! these pants are great! nice fit, very slimming! i would have to order a small for a true &#34;compression&#34; fit. i like them so much i just ordered another pair! these leggings are awesome the front is pleather and the back is regular legging material. they fit nicely and look soooo good. im pretty sure these only come in one size...i am a size 5 (more or less) and they fit perfectly. they are stretchy so im sure they would fit a few sizes larger or smaller. so cool and not expensive def. glad i bought these. everything about them was as expected and would work with the seller again. i just love these. i bought a pair for my daughter and she loves them too. flattering fit and very flattering! super comfy! i can\\'t say enough about these pants! i\\'m ordering them in every color. they are so comfortable and seem to go with everything.  i normally wear an 8 but these fit me great in a 6. love these pants!!! its soo comfy and soft.  i can dress it up, or dress it down depending on the occasion. [[videoid:3229bc671fe421abed2730a7c56fb2ae]] love the colors these jeans come in!<br /><br />i ordered a pair in black because it gives me so many options to wear with it. i love the blues for sure, and hope to get those later on!<br />these will go nicely with almost any type of shirt, cami, top, jacket, etc.<br />pair the black jeans with a red cami and a black shrug, with a pair of sexy red heels, and you have a perfect outfit.<br /><br />i need to note here that i ordered a size 18, and i am a true 18 (most clothing fits me just right), but these were definitely too small.  i advise going one to two sizes up. i will be getting a replacement size, so i am reviewing these based on the quality and fashion of the jeans i received.<br /><br />as noted in my video, there is a good amount of stretch, which allows for a nice snug fit, which you definitely want in a skinny jean!<br />the design on the back is pretty and eye catching, and the color (in this case black) is perfect for matching with multiple outfits.<br />the jeans are well made, and i think, i true bargain for the price.<br />there are a lot of colors to choose from!<br /><br />i look forward to getting mine in the correct size<br /><br />this product was provided for my review, opinion, and inspection. all thoughts are my own they are worth the price paid although they have not been worn yet. just from going by look and feel the pants are worth the cost i wouldnt pay more though. i returned bc they were too small. other tian that i liked them. i would buy a size bigger than i wear. they did not have an xl size. i had to return it, but the quality was great! love em! i want more (: these are adorable and i can\\'t wait for our vacation to wear them. the only con is that they aren\\'t lined at all! so you might want to wear them with a bikini bottom. i\\'m 5\\'11 and these fit perfect love these, so comfortable and easy on the pocket book, fast shipping easy purchase. i even reordered more. i may even order again# a bit large and very low in the…. crotch ? area. i am a female and last time i checked my lady parts were not that low. but i guessi have to wear as a high rise….which only works with certain dresses. got it for a cosplay guess we shall see. my wife likes em. love them, comfortable material and fit. these ship from china but they are nice. they are heavier than expected and not super long but they work. the price is good and the quality seems nice.i haven\\'t washed them yet, but i think i\\'ll do it by hand because of the cashmere blended in. i got a medium which is comparable to a medium in other long underwear brands. love them!! very casual fitting and actually enjoyable to wear, makes doing yoga and stretching very easy with the loose fit it\\'s nicely made but very small. their size large is more like a u.s. size small really nice yoga pants made of light fabric, super comfy. once i watched the youtube video explaining how to wear these pants, i was hooked! they are very thin, perfect for summer and the tiedye is very beautiful (and it really is dyed, not a print). i\\'m pretty big but these are still very comfy and roomy. i would by these again and recommend them to anyone who likes easy to move around in beautiful pants. perfect!!! it was gift for my friend and exactly what i wanted !!! i will order these again in different colors! love them and they wear great! they do run a little large but, that\\'s ok, i need all the room i can get!! :) love those prints, love that style! makes me feel alive.. it has a great fit, and the fabric has a beautiful hand feel. its soft and cute. my mother loved it. i got it for her for a spa christmas present. she finds it very nice. cute. comfy. true to size. gosh, i\\'m not sure what else i could possibly say that would be helpful. good. the pants got here 4 days before estimated arrival time. the only thing i don\\'t like about it is that it\\'s a little see through and it runs a little big. they\\'re very comfortable and it\\'s easy to hide the pockets if needed. overall, i\\'m not disappointed. it looks exactly like in the picture but its jot stretchy at all which i\\'m use to :( but it fits me well and i wear a 5/6 in jeans. it\\'s more like a straight leg on me though but that\\'s because i have skinny legs. i like it. these pants fit exactly the way i like to wear them.  they were recommended to me by a friend and she said the same thing.  we are both very active senior women, involved everyday in some form of exercise, from zumba to yoga and everything in between.  i will probably be ordering another pair in the near future.  thanks. they fit well, i am a size 14. love them! i love it!! very good comfortable. fits to size and easy to launder. i totally love the colour but the material stretches ...a lot! next time i will order one size lower. i wasn\\'t sure what i was expecting but when i received these pants i was pleasantly surprised. i am 5\\'5&#34; and around 109 lbs and they fit just perfectly. the material is a lot thicker than i was expecting, which is not a bad thing. after closer inspection i don\\'t notice anything wrong with the stitching, or anything else wrong at all. they are super soft and i love the pattern. i haven\\'t washed them yet but i honestly will not be putting them in the dryer. considering the banding is elastic on the ankles and the waist i know the dryer will destroy the elasticity after several washings. best to just hang dry. i love these so much. i will be ordering several more pairs in the future. bring on the comfort!! i bought these for my wife because she wanted a pair to lounge around in. she really likes them and the fit is great like wearing nothing. as expected.  nice pants. fit her fantastic! somewhat &#34;stretchy&#34; like jeggins. girls, read the reviews. love the cargo pants. they definitely run small. i purchased a size 29 and i wear a 27 ( 2 ) in other clothing. the vendor delivered in just 2 weeks, that was great. didn\\'t expect them for 4 weeks. the material of these pants are great quality and the fit is perfect. the color is exact and they are very comfortable. like they fit good but a bit long they fit great and they are good quality, especially for the price! they fit well because of the material but the pattern is very cool and lines up on the seams perfectly.<br />well worth the affordable price amazing fit so comfortable a little long but that\\'s how i like them . great quality too i could live in these. everytime i wear these pants, everyone turns their heads (even women). fits perfectly & fhey feel like butter! better than i expected !!! warm flannel with pockets ! just what i was looking for washes beautifully will order more :))) great summer pants comfortable and always look nice fast shipping considering it was from china. product is as expected these are perfect in every way.  ordered 2 sizes smaller as one reviewer suggested and worked out great. they don\\'t shrink in the wash and fit like a glove. ordered three more in different colors my favorite scrub pants.  so flattering and they came in tall which i need! weird lookign with the pink padding, but comfortable for cycling. hang to dry.love that they had 2x size. i went with a size bigger because i\\'ve gained some weight and i\\'m kind of between sizes. they fit perfectly! they are a bit long, but i\\'m rather short so that happens to me a lot (especially if i don\\'t buy something in petite sizes). i love the material and the feel of these pants. i\\'m very happy with this purchase. this is the only capri i could find with so much lycra!i like it! who can argue with a firm backside?? i ordered these puppies on the 9th of this month, and i tore open the package this morning. just a week later!! super awesome shipping from half way around the world. the material is incredibly soft and silky. they fit just right, and they\\'re going to look amazing when my shirt arrives. love love love it. as strechy as the material is, i could have gone at least one size smaller than i usually wear, otherwise theyare great@ i am 5\\'7&#34; 130 pounds and they fit perfectly! love, love, love them! graphics look amazing and get many compliments on them. it fit great. i love it! these are perfect. i am 5 foot 2 inches and 120 lbs. great pants and they are longggg!  i have had problems in the past finding comfortable pants that are not high-water and do not shrink.  i am 5\\'-11&#34; and a big woman.  i got a 3x but i could get into a 2x or 1x as these pants do not shrink after washing!<br /><br />brenda g.<br />peekskill, ny comfy!!!! these are good quality pants, but the length is a little short. if you ordering for a taller women (over 5\\'6&#34;) might want to order men\\'s. the black sequins are also iridescent..very cool...they fit very nice also...the model must be a midget...i thought they would be longer like real pants..but they are like leggings..i bought a med (im 5\\'8\\\\\\\\\") they are lined also which is nice..noo itchies yay!!! im going to wear them to dance at a party i will letcha know how they hold up ;) soft and versatile :) i got tons of compliments very comfortable and the butterflies are bright and cute! fit as expected i am very pleased with this item and enjoy wearing these pants :)  came quicker than their competitor.  :) my mom loves these. i bought them as a gift for her. she loves this style of pants but they don\\'t sell them in stores.<br />shes happy. :) i love it, fits as expected. i probably wear a large in other uniforms, but a medium fit perfectly. nice winter white color. quality product. love it! fits awesome and looks great(: great buy for my sisters girls they love pj\\'s, trying to keep them happy because i try to buy what they like nice fit. heavy fabric which should be great for winter. good i bought these for my mother in a nursing home.  easy to get on and off and still look very fashionable they were perfect and they so soft! great pants. couldn\\'t wait to try them on. i was disappointed with the cut. while the rise in front was a good fit, the back came way down to underwear level. the length was great. i am 5\\' 10&#34; and appreciate the length. the thighs were too tight and the waist band was too loose. cool love them they fit just right and comfy but i only got to wear them once... the seams coming aprt i am giving these 5 stars because i don\\'t ever want to be judgmental or mean.  truth is i tried them on ... hung them in the closet and will probably never wear them until i am looking for something i don;t mind painting in.  not my best purchase but i have never learned how to send things back. calories are comfortable and stylish.  good purchase.  recommend. wow! i love these jeans. they are comfortable and don\\'t look like mom jeans like the other pull ons offered by other brands. i am 5 feet 5 and they are not too lond and not too short. i feel great in them. i will be wearing them with a womems solid color loose asymmetry flowy shirt and on hot days a tank top. i think they will lool great with toms, converse, or gothy black boots with a chunky heal. enjoy! very comfortable and light. fit perfectly and look awesome just received this today and omg its cute fits great, its stretchy and its something you should definitely buy and look into! 😍 they run a little small before ordering, i read the reviews and majority of them stated you have to order a couple sizes bigger. so i did and it fit perfectly. too long for my height, 5\\'4&#34;.  beautiful pattern, giving them to my niece with much longer legs, lol. from the reviews, i knew they\\'d be too long for me, so that was no surprise. i love these pants!!! they are my luxury for the evening. being 5\\'2&#34;, all i have to do is turn the waistband, and they\\'re just right. they\\'re so soft and soothing. thanks so much for providing some comfort after a long day!!! i love it. very sexy, but it does not make one look like a slut. they are perfect !!! i wore these as often as i could during my entire 2nd and 3rd trimesters. loved them. super comfortable and thick enough that i didn\\'t feel inappropriate. didn\\'t have that sheen where if the sunlight hit them wear you can kind of see the skin underneath like some other leggings. i highly recommend these. i enjoy the fit.  in the winter, i can wear leggins top and bottom.  will not be snug.  love the fit. on your skin.  i like these pants.  they got this rating only because i will have to hem them as they are too long. pants are nice and fit just right. great fit! these were great. similar to the pair above but better made. love these shorts fit comfortable and help out a lot niece received as xmas gift. she liked them. a little big on her but all is good. these are fantastic!  they stay up without being tight or uncomfortable.  i ordered every color after receiving the first pair. my favorite pants! this is the third jumper that i bought from this company. i  absolutely love it it arrived on friday i didn\\'t check my mail until tonight. i try it on i-thought it was adorable. will buy more items from this seller.  okay i order 4 jumpers and i absolutely love them all but 1. comfortable not thick and hot. ordered two pairs of these (black and olive green) knowing that as a guy with a nice hulking 6\\'3&#34; norwegian frame, these weren\\'t going to fit exactly like the model in the pic. while they don\\'t reach completely down to my ankles which was expected, they still look great when they hit around the calf area. great fit and comfortable material! have already gotten some great compliments from people around town and at work strutting around feeling like mc hammer and aladdin\\'s love child. haha. my only complaint is that i didn\\'t order more the first time around. already have my second order in for dark blue and red! great job guys! this was one of the most comfortable pair i have purchased. it fitted well around the hips, but since i am short legged, i always have had issue with the length, but that\\'s not the fault of the maker.  it was definitely worth the money, and is comfortable.  if you are not into low rise, this is not for you.  it was well rounded at the ankle so i didn\\'t have to flip it inside out, when i was taking it off, which i find the case often with most skinny pants. ladys you ill love them really a nice outfit, made well,, fits well, feels nice.  great! i recommend this outfit for anyone.  you will be satifsfied. bought these for my little girl she loves them. very cute and comfortable. not to sheer or to tight. thanks. like these - i think the size if right but i wasn\\'t sure how to size pants like this so i think i will get another pair one size smaller - but i think it was me, not the sizing:-) so comfy!! pretty thin material, so great for hot days. shrinks in the dryer, which worked out for me because i wanted them to be shorter. i like it these are great travel outfits to wear. machine washable and quite comfortable. no shrinkage. good price and versatile. i love them. great warm up pants. such breathable material and dries almost immediately. nice wide legs allows me to put on and take off without having to remove shoes. will buy this brand only from now on. i love love these pants! wore them to the office & everyone asked about them. i hope to order more.<br />they are super comfy, long, and for me it\\'s like wearing fancy sweatpants. the price and quality are very good they are perfect.  great fit and length. love this! the material is so light and flowy. i wore this out in 90 degree weather and i stayed so cool in them. i am actually going to order more of these. i am 5\\'3 and a size 5-7 in pants and they fit wonderful. they do look really small when you take it out of the packaging but they stretch really wide. love it♥ i heeded the reviews that said these fit on the tight side so i went a size up and the fit is perfect for me.  comfortable and great looking.  my first foray into jeggings is a hit. size was just as described!!love them awesome scrubs! they totally feel like pajamas! i have these pants in the pinstripe, and i love them. definately fit great in my size 22 5\\'9\\\\\\\\\" frame. they are the perfect length and fit. nice material, soft sensation but not very flattering actually. runs bulky, i would definitely prefer a &#34;skinnier&#34; fit.<br />i\\'ll keep it for its quality but not for it\\'s looks.<br />i am 5 2&#34; and 115 pounds at my 17 week of pregnancy. i purchased these for my winter cycling commute. the mornings have been cold and i have been warm thanks to duofold. very light weight and worth the money ! great fit, very slimming. length is a little longer than expected, but otherwise good fit i really liked this scrub set. i bought a size x-small and the top fits perfect on me, but the pants are a little weird they fit a little loose on the top and they fit more snug by the knee area i don\\'t know it is a little weird. but overall i do like them specially the material is really soft and feels good on the skin. i would recommend this set to anyone. i am considering getting more of this scrub sets in more colors. i wish they had a wider variety of colors. love love them great all around great pair fit fine and my daughter really wants a pair .her birthday is soon so i\\'m going to order here a pair. happy with my purchase..exactly as described! i am so ecstatic that i bought these, they fit great. as soon as i got them i tried them on and did not want to take them off. i justhit 7months and finally start showing which means i can hardly fit any pants now. these are a perfect match comfortable, stretchable, and look nice with everyday wear. a must have!!!! very soft sleep short...roomy<br />leg holes and very cute nice and comfy lighter weight than pictured, wear pink or white panties. totally cute. i\\'ve been asked several times where i got them. comfy. awesome soft cozy but little holes started quick along the back seam..so pretty though im going to sew them because i love them, but its annoying. very comfortable great color. beware, they are polyester. show every bump and bulge. im not very top heavy so i need to figure out how to keep the top up or have it taken in but i still love the way it fit i love them!!! pants fit as expected  based on product description.  i\\'m 5\\'6 / 135 / 27in  waist  and purchased a  small. a  little snug in hip area but not tight &  the length was perfect.  would definitely order again &  more colors. i love the fit.  its a bit snug, but nice.  i will order again. bought these in three different colors. very glad i read the reviews and got a size up (medium). feel great, fit great, look great, and can\\'t wait to wear them. so ready for the 4th! i am 5\\'5,&#34; generally wear a size 8 pants and ordered large.  these were about 6inches too long for me!!  i hemmed them and now the length is great, but there is a little cheapness to the fabric that makes them hang weird- honestly only i notice it, no one else sees it even if i point it out.  i could have probably gone with a medium but i wanted these to be loose and comfy, and fortunately there is a drawstring in the waste that helps hold them in place.  i\\'m not crazy about the fold over waste band, it loosens a bit and if i fold it to the natural fold line, my butt crack shows so i just don\\'t fold it that low.  they are worth the $ if you\\'re willing to alter them or you are super tall! love it with several different tunic/shirt colors awesome pants. the pattern is beautiful and rich with the mix of geometrics and florals and jewel images, however on mine, the dominating colors are navy, yellow and pink. the purple was on the very bottom, that i had to cut off, and very top. this fabric is very soft and comfortable also. it looks like it won\\'t fray, so i just chopped the bottom and left it like that. amazing fit. just the perfect amount of flare at the bottom. halfway between a wide flare and a ankle hugging leggings. and even though the material is lightweight, it is quality and goes through the rigors of a 4 hour dance work out. i also have long legs so this is the perfect length for me. wear this at the office and at the gym. bought 3 pairs and planning on buying 10 more! what a deal! i ordered these for halloween, they worked out well. for the price they were exceptional. they came way faster than expected. i would totally order from this company again. fit? well i expected them to be big on me i am 5\\'1\\\\\\\\\" 100 lbs and have very short legs. i did have to roll them at the waist a few times and they are a tad baggy, but the looked great! i plan on wearing them often! the pants feel good on me. kind of thin, the material but comfortable for running errands ir cleaning up the house. i would recommend it. i absolutely love this romper it fits as expected very roomy and looks just like the picture as a romper or a jumper. its very fashionable and the fabric is a light weight not too stiff dark denim. i have so many compliments when i wear it. i go to the beach and have only a bathing suit underneath it. i love wearing leggings with tunics. tees, short dresses, and long ones with slits.  these leggings have a beautiful pattern and can be alternated to wear with different tops.  the fit is very comfortable and they arrived quickly!!!  thanks :) fine for a onetime halloween costume! i am 5\\'11 and wear a size 12. i got a large tall and they fit pretty well.  these are a bit thicker than usual scrub pants, which is nice.  i got a ruby red pair and am happy with the color. the length is barely long enough and when i sit i feel like they are way short. it\\'s okay for winter though. all in all a nice pant! nice palazzo pants! i love the vibrant coloring and odd designs. i don\\'t know if i was lucky but from behind where one group of feathers was &#34;cut off or ended&#34; on the left leg, they were picked up on the right leg so it looks &#34;complete.&#34; the high waist is not elastic but a continuance of the same rayon/spandex material that can fold over. i may just take in the waist an inch to make sure pants don\\'t fall off of me. i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; and pants fall just to cover my feet in flats. i bought a pair of these pants for work, hoping they would be pretty but comfortable.  the minute i put them on i knew i had to have another pair at that price.  they fit so nicely.  they drape nicely and the length is good for me.  i\\'m 5.3.  they can be dressed up or dressed down.  so far the fabric has done well in the wash, and i really hope they last.  my new favorite pair of work pants! love. fits comfortable and so pretty. have many colors.  this is my 4th pair. i will always be ordering from here. luv luv luv. great i got item promptly and it fits as expected,  but it is some kind of nylon material.  isn\\'t real great for heavy workout it\\'s been hard to find a petite size heavy fleece cuffed sweat pant for dog walking in our frigid weather. well, ladies, here it is. i originally got a larger size, but even though they shrank considerably in the waist (two inches, i would say) and a bit lengthwise (about an inch), they were still too big for me, so i recommend ordering a size smaller. i wear a size 10 pants and have a 26&#34; inseam. so the small is perfect for me.they are warm and fluffy. pockets are handy for treats and bags. i got a size bigger because i usually find that medium lounge pants are not loose enough for my comfort. i use them as pajamas and they\\'re just perfect....soft and comfortable without making you feel too warm. good quality, fabric very light and therefore not bulky to wear.  i have to wear sun protective clothing year round and living in phoenix, it\\'s great to have products that not only protect you from uv rays but also look good and wash and wear.  i don\\'t use a dryer except to fluff my clothes but even then, comes out great. i\\'ve worn these pants twice and really like them. the fit is as expected everywhere except the waist, which is just a little bit tight. i ordered the same pant in the wide waistband version, maybe i\\'ll see a difference. i like the material and cut and am happy with my purchase. fun pants beautiful. bought as a gift. fast shipping time i love these yoga pants! i\\'m 5&#34;7, and they are pretty much the exact perfect length - they hit me right at the top of my foot, around my ankle bone. they aren\\'t exceptionally thick material, but i feel that this makes them airy and comfortable rather than hot and constricting. they\\'re nice and soft, and not really see through. and for the price, i\\'m sure i\\'ll come back for more! love love love these pants!!! i am a size 12 and they fit me perfectly!. the legs are full and wide and they look awesome!! length is good as well, i am 5\\'6&#34; and they are plenty long. color is a rusty orange and beautiful! i don\\'t like things around my waist an with the soft elastic waistband to fold down they are so comfortable! the bottoms fit a tad bit small but i\\'m sure once i wash and wear it will be perfect! i love the way it looks on me i can\\'t wait to wear it. it did take a few weeks to get here but i knew that when i ordered it. 5\\'6 133lbs beautifully made pants, but they run small. i bought these to wear for bible school, the theme is outer space, i love them and they are just great,just what i wanted. these are just amazing sexy jogger pants ! it fits my butt perfectly and definetly mine and my boyfriends fave pants love these jeans. they\\'re not like jeggins at all, they look and feel like denim.<br />the only issue i have is the button flew right off as soon as i unbuttoned them. the button must not have been sewed on right cool very beautiful and stylish-just as the picture speaks. for the fitting, idk. got it for someone else but according to her, she likes it! i love them. so cumphy they fit to size. i wear a 12/14 and bought a large. good material. fit snug to my body. if you like pants that are less form fitting i would go a large size. color is good. hope this helps. it is hard to decide size without seeing the product. thank you so much they are exactly what i expected! they fit perfectly and are super comfortable!!! i can\\'t wait to wear them for my event! the material feels sorta like spandex and molds to your body really well. they are cute and almost feel like youre not even wearing anything awesome present for my daughter - very soft, thick and plushy pants! these capris are really nice. they are dyed in the pattern shown, they washed well, and did not shrink when dried on low heat. they arrived well before the promised due date, were carefully packaged, and just as described. highly recommend both seller and these cute capris. they were a bit large for me but probably a true medium.  i was afraid to order the small. fit is great: room to move, bend and stretch. fabric is very soft and light. light weight. warm comfortable. before was wearing more than one pair thermals and still cold. these are all i need under my work clothes not bad for the price my new fav for work or play i loved the plaid pattern, so i was disappointed.  the pants are fitted smaller than how it is sized.  i am normally a size 10.  so, i ordered a medium.  it was way too small.  so just keep that in mind when ordering. the pants fit great! look amazing on and hug in all the right places. super comfortable to wear inside and outside the house. not very thick so you won\\'t get overly warm while wearing them but keep you warm enough if you are in a cold room. love it! great fabrics!!! love this comfy and fun pants. perfect summer colors. just what i was looking for. what was i looking for? a pair of well made and comfy cute pjs. they hold up well in the washer and dryer too without shrinking. they are about an inch too long but i have a 30&#34; inseam so i\\'m used to that. i read all the reviews, most fabulous, a few not so much, and like all purchases, one has to decide if the positives override the negatives and if the negatives are your issues.<br /><br />these noble mount pj bottoms are absolutely amazing, in fit, softness and wearability.  if i could, i would wear them everyday all day.  they get softer as you wash them, feel oh, so comfy in bed and are very pretty.  i got the blue package and wished the design was different on screen, but when  i received them and put them on, i was delighted.  i will never, ever buy any other brand of pajama bottoms.  i buy pajama bottoms and pair them with a t-shirt as i i refuse to pay $60+ for something to lounge and sleep in,  i am 66 years old, and 160 lbs.  i bought the x-large and they are roomy, comfy and not at all tight.  i like my stuff loose.  also, tho they looked too long when i took them out of the pkg they shrunk in length just to the perfect length. i really like the color of this pair of leggings.  i purchased a pair of lysse a couple of years ago and just love them.  they have worn well but really needed to be replaced so i bought this pair through amazon.  they fit well; however, i don\\'t feel like the quality of the leggings are the same as my first pair.  feels like different material and seem to be made a little different.  having said that i\\'m glad i bought this pair and plan to buy more. pants are very see through be sure to wear leggings underneath... these pants fit great and are wearable either as workout pants or going out shopping.  they are a win/win pant for whatever you want them to be! i wear a medium and i purchased a medium.  this fit perfect and its very comfy.  i love it!  the front is very open so i pin it or wear a tank top underneath. love how these pants fit!  nice loose fit with usable pockets.  it is very hard to find ladies\\' warmups of this material with usable pockets.  love the material - very comfortable and keeps its shape nicely.  the inseam is 34&#34;.  would advise making these available in petite length. excellent quality and perfect fit. so pleased with not only the fit but how nice the feel are of these and highly recommend them to others. pants fit great, love them so comfortable. i\\'m 5\\'2&#34;, 150 lbs and the large fits beautifully. they are medium to high rise. when i set down nothing is hanging out. comfortable!! many compliments. ordered brown, however they were a beige/tan color. good quality!! love these jeans love them thanks love mopas- always a good fit and quality to wear under dresses when it\\'s cold.  consistent product- same cut, size and quality every time i buy them. love the fit. can\\'t wait for the warmer weather to come. as these will be perfect for keeping cool. this pants are so cute the fit is perfect not too small or big. looks just like the picture (fit) as there were more print across the top and side and not just on bottom of legs.(it may vary due to the pattern if you get more print in different area of pant good quality... these skinny, lined jeans fit very well--really true to size.  i really like them very much and they\\'ve helped me do saturday errands during this winter from hell a little easier! the fit was as expected without being too constricting. very warm and comfortable pants.<br />i would like it a bit smaller, but nothing important (i\\'m very thin, so maybe xs would be better for me).<br />i probably will buy another one :) love these pants so much.  using them for yoga.  just so comfy.  breathable mesh on the sides.  color and patterns are just stunning. i ordered palazzo pants from three top selling brands via amazon, and these are, by far, the most superior as far as quality of material, pattern, and fit, and overall flattering cut.  they are not see through while still being very comfy and breezy, and they do hide some extra buldges for me unlike the other brands.  i am 5\\'7&#34; and weigh 137 and i ordered the small black and white polka dotted.  the length is perfect for me and i would say that my legs are on the shorter to medium side.  they are super fun and i\\'m wearing them out to play cello in a concert tonight but can also see these as some fun every day pants for someone who likes to dress in a fun and upbeat style. looks just as good in person as it does on the model. i wanted these for the beach and they fit great and look great! i am 5\\'5&#34; and they are long on me, like dragging on the ground long. i don\\'t mind, though! they look amazing on my wife and arrived quickly. super comfy. the linen portion hits at mid-rise so you don\\'t get muffin top, while the stretchy top gives full coverage. great for the price. highly recommend for comfort and quality the material is much more durable than i expected and the shipment arrived sooner than stated. i\\'m 5\\'2\\\\\\\\\" and 108 lbs, i ordered a ladies \\\\\\\\\"medium\\\\\\\\\" and they fit perfect, similar to a us size 3 (junior). i will have to take some length off the bottom but that\\'s pretty common since i am height challenged. if you are curvy (which i am not) you may want to order a size up. the fit in the hips and thighs is straight from the waist. i am 5\\'11&#34; and 125lbs i ordered a medium and i love these.  they look great with ankle booties or sandals, plus they are super comfy. i like these pants a lot. they are a cute rustic color and they stretch a little so they are super comfy. i never wore leggings until i found the lysse brand pants about two years ago.  i bought my first pair of lysse leggings in size large (was a size 10-12).  they fit extremely well in all the right places, while some leggings feel more like tights,  the higher cotton content makes for a thicker, more &#34;substantial&#34; fabric, that moves and &#34;breathes&#34; (while not getting all stretched out over a long day), making them extremely comfortable.  the wider waist band provides extra firm tummy control around waist, and the design helps to shape hips and rear effectively.  this past spring, my oldest pair has begun to show some slight fading of the black from washing, but i feel that\\'s only to be expected with a cotton-blend fabric.<br /><br />last year, after losing some weight and going down to about a size 8, i purchased two additional pairs of these lysse leggings  -- i wasn\\'t sure about the size, so i ordered one in small and one in medium.  actually, they both work.  the medium is very comfortable and i wear them for more casual looks -- with oversized sweaters, etc  i\\'ve found the small size also works, &#34;pulling more in&#34; for a &#34;sleeker&#34; look.<br /><br />i have other leggings, but the lysse\\'s are usually my &#34;go to&#34; choice for daily wear.  i recommend them highly. a lil big but over all very comfortable and the materiel keeps you cool super comfy, a little long but still good. they are wonderful! wife loved them! a beautiful pant, looks exactly as picture. i am a size 4. it fits perfectly. they are a bit long, but they shrank some after being washed. i am 5\\'5. they are very stretchy. they look great with long cardigans. the fabric is very soft. i needed some pants for work and to wear to my college classes after work. being i am petite and skinny it is really hard to find pants that fit me right. these skinny jeans were the right choice. i don’t feel like they are falling off me. the fit nicely love it and the feel great!!! 5\\'2, 97 lbs. wear a size 1 in jeans & a small in leggings. these fit perfect. not short ankle leggings. they bunch up a little around the ankles, which is fine because i\\'d planned on wearing them with boots. the front are pleather. kind of a black plastic look (really shiny) which i expected less shine... the back are double lined, black stretchy nylon. not see through. pretty much look like the picture. not bad for the price. will look cute with a long shirt or dress with boots.  going to hand wash & hang dry these because of the pleather. took 16 days to come in the mail. works well for me i wasn\\'t sure what i was getting when i ordered these pants, but i really wanted the wide leg pants.  i like wide legs in my pants.  i don\\'t consider these pants to have wide legs - or, they are the minimum necessary to label them that.  mainly, they seem to be wide because they are not skinny - a look i hate.<br /><br />they are really comfortable though. i\\'ve worn them to work on long days and have enjoyed feeling comfortable through the entire day.  also, they wear well and look good.  i wear them with a top and a casual jacket and they look good with them. comfortable to wear they are durable and fit perfectly. i like the material and seems to be good quality for a great price.... i will buy them again in the future for the money they are great....fabric is a thinner cotton....so they do seem to bag/stretch quicker.....generous length.....did shorten a bit on washing though,....def worth the $$ my new favorite pants i was nervous about ordering a one size legging since i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; and 110 lbs, but this fits perfectly and i love the fleece lining to help keep me warm. been using these a lot this winter.  wish i had gotten a smaller size.  but they work great for keeping my lower torso and legs warm. love these pants. super soft & so comfy, i could live in them! love the leg flare. the material does offer a good amount of stretch to them & they fit great. i always have a problem with buying clothes online but these were great & true to size according to the size chart. i did wash them before wearing them on & they did shrink a teeny bit but nothing major. they look awesome & feel even better. very very comfortable. i\\'m very glad i got the opportunity to test these out for my honest unbiased opinion. love, love, love them! great for anytime, i have worn them casually & formally. and also received many compliments on them. stitching on this is perfect with no crooked seams or loose or pulled threads. also i must add, the packaging was awesome too, have added pics. very impressed & would definitely recommend posh square clothing & customer service! 5 plus stars! i needed it for a costume; i was expecting an xxl to be a lot larger (i wear a 14), but they stretch, so it worked out.  for the price, it was worth it. i would buy again in a different color; would i wash them, no. great for costumes/1 time use. excellent fit.  delivered as promised love\\'em!! what to get more!! looks great, fits great. i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; and 123 pounds and the medium is a perfect fit. they are a little big but that is fault....i got the wrong size!  go weightwatchers!! these are nice very tights. i got them to make into arm socks for homestuck trolls (which i have yet to do), and the color is pretty close to snazaroo light grey, perfect for troll skin. the tights are stretchy and good quality. plus they were $5 and arrived in two weeks! i would buy again. love it the material is quite thin, as some reviewers reported; however, not too thin that they are see through.  i am 5\\'8&#34; and the length is just right with a small heel.  i was expecting them to be much longer but was pleasantly surprised with the length. i purchased the xl because i am a size 8-10 in most jeans. these fit perfect everywhere but on my thighs where they are extremely tight and i feel nervous when i sit that they will rip. i would definitely purchase again though and just get the correct size. totally my mistake not there\\'s. love the pockets and fabric. great cargo pants especially for the price. so comfy! i\\'m 5.3 and 110 pounds and then fit perfectly. super lightweight and flowing. i love that the lace isn\\'t itchy like others that i have gotten. wish that they had more colors. my wife love this i really love these pants but they were too big in the hips.  initially they were a little long too.  i\\'m 5\\'2, but figured they would be fine if i wore them with tall heals.  i washed them once and they shrank a bit in the length department so they are just about perfect.  the hips were still too large and did not flatter my figure at all, so i took them to be altered.  i have no doubt they will turn out great and i got such a good deal on them that i don\\'t really mind paying a little extra for the alterations. these pants really confortable and the colors are very pretty. i\\'m glad i purchased them. received thank you much love these. bought a pair for my teen. they come up way too high. not at all as pictured. they really do look like torn up jeans though and if you\\'re wearing a long shirt, no one would know how high-waisted they are. i was skeptical when i saw these pants because the price seemed too good to be true. i bought one pair to see what kind of quality i would get. i liked them so much i had to buy another pair in the other color choice! i\\'m a size 1-2 and i got the small - they have a loose comfortable fit and look great. my only complaints are that both pairs came with lots of strings hanging off, so i had to check them and cut off all the strings, and both had a button fall off the first day of wear. again, not much of an issue - i can sew a button back on, and for $10, totally worth the small inconvenience. at the end of the day, i wish they had these in dozens of colors and patterns and i\\'d buy more! lovely fabric, nice fit, although a bit small.  very comfortable andcould be worn for yoga or with a kurta or more dressy top. a very versatile piece. i ordered this pant in a size large, and i was a little scared it wouldn\\'t fit because i read in another review that the large fits a size 8.  i just delivered and am still between a size 10 and a 12, but i ordered it anyway, in any case i could always return it, and to my surprise it fit me just right, perfect.  so i guess if you fall between a size 10 and 12, the large will fit.  this pant was just what i wanted. looked just like the picture and fit perfectly. i just wish that i was able to choose the ones that i wanted, but in the end i still love them. feels good. love it! the fit pretty good and are made of good material. they are pretty long on me but i haven\\'t washed them yet so i don\\'t know how much they will shrink. they are 100% cotton. i figure they will fit well once i put them in the dryer. i really like the material.  i live in arizona so heavy material was not the choice i was looking for.  i will prevent elastic from folding in half my tossing in some stitches to keep it intact.  it fits as described, i ordered a large needing a medium normally.  i would not want it any loser.  it does not feel like it will fall apart if it does i be back with a different review.<br /><br />i am ordering the black set today. love this scrubs, are soft, light, pretty and comfortable! comfy comfy pants but somewhat sheer. super comfy and cute, these fit perfectly. i\\'m 5\\'7 and 112 lbs and purchased a small/medium. my only complaint is the pockets stick out in a really unflattering way... fortunately my grandma was able to make some alterations and fix it how i like it. i\\'m super tiny (4\\'10&#34;) and was skeptical about these because i never really have any success with one size fits all clothes, but these are perfect! i got the black and it is so cute. i absolutely love these pants, so comfy, nice material, and gorgeous pattern. best uniforms we have ever purchased. they wear great! super comfy and better quality than i expected. only downside is they are not actually wrap pants and they fit a little big. fits well. long though this product runs a bit smaller than i would have really like it to, i understand because i have a power-lifter butt and thighs.  they are super comfortable, breathable, and adorable.  i can\\'t wait to wear these on my trip to costa rica this spring! the pants pictured fit great albeit the fact the\\'re some kind of nylon material. i wouldn\\'t call it spandex but it\\'s soft so i\\'m not complaining. however these were shipped with a pair of black harem pants in the same size. i\\'m not complaining! love the fit and they are very comfy but the material is very thin. i worry about ripping them if i move the wrong way. fit is a bit snug, but comfortable. size is very small (i ordered an xl) nice comfortable fabric, although it may need to be steamed to prevent excessive wrinkling.. color is stunning. great for casual date wear or around the house. these are a lovely color that match my more expensive gray\\'s anatomy scrub top.  they have held up well to wear and i love that they come in tall sizes! these are really great cargo pants. i am ordering another pair. i ordered a size down from my  regular size and they fit perfect. i wear them all the time,  the length is extremely long but they are so soft, and roomy, and even flattering.  i love them so much, i have three pairs in black and a pair in blue, plus the short version . one size fits all always makes me nervous, especially since i\\'m a size 10 jeans, but these fit great! they\\'re very comfortable and don\\'t cut into me anywhere. the fabric feels sturdy and i don\\'t feel like i have to worry about them ripping. i would definitely purchase these in more colors. these are great and comfort. make a great gift i really like these pants, but should have paid closer attention to the reviews. trust me ladies, these pants are made for long legged ladies. they come un-hemmed, which i understood, but after taking so much fabric off...i\\'m wondering if there will be much flare. taking the pants to a seamstress to see what her opinion may be.  the pants are comfortable, fit well around the middle, a nice rich color, and i didn\\'t find them flimsy as some did. hope to get them hemmed and wearable for a christmas party.  one last thing  for my red hat buddies, they are more burgundy in color than purple.  update:  seamstress hemmed these pants with ease and they didn\\'t lose their flare. received many complements. i honestly have no idea what everyone is talking about when they say they\\'re too small. i\\'m 5\\'4 and 125lbs usually wearing a xs-s. i ordered a us 4 because my jean size is 4. these come with an internal belt that you have to tie to fit your waist and i have to keep it tight in order for them to stay up and not hang off my hips. i really like them but i wish they were an actual 4. i will be ordering another pair in a us 2 and see if they fit better. other than the size, they\\'re very comfortable and the camouflage color is nice. i really like them. i would have given it five stars except it attracts lint terribly and it\\'s not easy to get it off. they are really long. i\\'m 5\\'9&#34; and i still step on the bottom of these. but they are soft and super comfortable. i will buy them in another color to see if that makes a difference with the lint. my wife really likes them. got them for her birthday the fit was good, however, for me at 5ft 5in they were way too long!  i am going to have to hem them a good 2 inches or greater.  they feel good! love the pants and they fit perfectly. i am not crazy about the tie waist though. since there is no elastic you must tie them. i don\\'t like that for myself. i like the comfortable elastic and if there is a tie i disregard it. thank you!!! love them. fit perfect, the material is nice, i like the print. i can\\'t believe i paid so little money for them, i need to order one of every color. see-through, but that was the point. boyfriend happy. this skirt definitely exceeded my expectations. not only was it under $10, it actually showed up looking like the photo! other than a few loose ends of fabric i had to cut off, very happy with the purchase & just ordered it in black. i typically wear a small/medium i did order a large & fit perfect! i ordered a medium, a size larger than i normally would, so it fit as i expected. i am 5 ft 3 and weigh 112. they are absolutely precious. i love them. wish it fit good i ordered a small, i\\'m usually a size xs or 0. with the exception of the length it fit perfectly! i\\'m very short 5\\'1. i was able to hem it about 3 inches. it would probably be perfect on someone a little taller. it is a little more snug in the hip and thigh area as others have stated. i am very happy with the fit. i plan on wearing this to my hawaii trip. nice pieces. because of my body type the xs is a little small on the hips/ thighs but over all nice fitting pieces . will order again in a size small i love them!  they will be perfect for my yoga classes. they are light weight and cool for the warm weather season. they are beautiful. they are a good fit for me but i don\\'t think they would fit size large or bigger. i\\'m a size medium is pretty cute and well made for the price, good material. (: these put me in mind of like suit pants, if that makes any sense. like if suit pants were jeggins minus the pockets in the front, that\\'s what they look like... something you can wear in the work place with a cute blazer, the top part of the pants fitted a little too snug but i like them enough to keep them! toasty, colorful snug leggings. now i have to wait to see how warm i will be when it gets cold outside. perfect price & should be lots of fun watching people look at me. got a small because they have a lot of stretch to them good product - well made - not see-thru like many.<br />i realize that i\\'m a bit taller than most - 5\\'10&#34; - however, these are not as long as they appear in the photo.  they fit pretty well, maybe a bit snug at the waist for me, just now - but, that is sure to get better.  i do wish they were truly as long as the photo implies.  i want a long capri, not a below the knee capri. absolutely adore these pants! comfy and beautiful gorgeous pants! 👍👍👍👍👍 they are a slim fit in the thighs and through the hips as stated in purchase information.  i, for one, am sick to death of baggy pants that make you look fatter than you already are.  these have a flattering fit through the thigh and rear end along with a high waist which is also fitted and comfortable.  i worked all day sitting in them and the waist never cut into my stomach which is far from flat.  the boot cut is a nice bell and the tall has plenty of room for my very long legs.  love them.<br />bought 2 more pairs immediately. super awesome pants of good quality! my only critcism is that the photo of these pants showed them as being more fitted down the length of the legs, unlike the photos of the same pants with other designs. the website was saying the clothes run a little smaller so i went up a size and it was too big. and it was really see through a. dunner clothes are well made, and color palettes continue to mix and match as time goes on.  very important to those of us ladies who are shorter rather than taller, to find ad slacks in short hem lengths.  the black jeans look dressier than regular jeans, yet are just as sturdy. very nice sweat pants. highly recommend and will buy another pair soon. although they were a bit thinner than i expected i still love them. very lightweight and comfortable and i love the design. i will absolutely be ordering some more colors! these pants are amazing!  i love t-party clothing...im a big fan the print is not exactly as i pictured it and it was pretty long very comfortable and stylish. i would recommend these pants because they look good and they feel very, very nice.  comfortable. they feel great!  i bought a bright lime green pair and the color was vivid and pleasing to the eye (looked as image in ad).  the only thing that you need to be concerned about is the sizing.  the sizing provided here, seems to be true. i am 5\\'4 and wear 16/18 most often.  sometimes i have to get a 20 to get extra loose and comfy. the one size fits all waist is great.  no pinching or binding and i think the a thinner person would not have any issue drawing up the strings.unfortunately, these pants are not long enough for me.  i think they would be a perfect fit for someone around 5\\' tall or less. at 5\\'4 the stretch band at the ankle rides up my calf and i find it uncomfortable and is not the look i want (i do not wear culottes or shorts as i do not expose my legs).<br /><br />overall a nice pair of harem pants.  just make sure before you buy them that the sizes stated in the description will work for you so that you are not disappointed if they are too short or otherwise do not fit. i was so excited to receive these pants today! the colors are vivid and showy. the fit is flattering and slimming. these will work great for work and going out! these are really cute and fit fine even though i read a review about not buying them if you have thick thighs...yoga pants do stretch. i\\'m a size 14 and got a large.  the thing i don\\'t like is how thin this fabric is and the seams feel scratchy. if you\\'re trying to cheap out while replacing your vs yoga pants these do not compare. but they still look good.<br />editing to add i have had these for 3 months now and they are still soft, no pilling or tearing at the seams despite me being lazy and putting them in the dryer the past 4x instead of hanging. the issue i had with the scratchy seam is gone (maybe after a few washes it softened up? not sure). these actually lasted longer than my vs ones, and though they don\\'t hold in my tummy the same way they are really good. going to get another pair. i absolutely love these pants.  i wish they weren\\'t discontinuing the bootcut leg.  i would buy them in every color. delivered with matching shorts and skippers. delivered on time. very cute. love these pants, they have just enough synthetic fiber to come out of the dryer without wrinkles but have enough cotton to be super-comfy! as a nurse i practically live in these pants and don\\'t mind them at all. satisified with product! super fast shipping! thanks! i ordered a pair of skinny jeans in black because i know it\\'s a versatile and i\\'ll have many options in mixing and matching in my clothes. the jeans arrived fast and safe.  the feel of the jeans is awesome the fabric is high quality, it fits nicely to my waist and the size is just right for me. overall the quality is good at a right price too. super cute & flattering! great pants. fit well. these white leggings are good to wear if your going to be wearing a skirt or dress over them because they are see-through. the shipping was fast and when i tried them on they were a little loose on my thighs but overall fit fine. i have a 34&#34; inseam so buying pants sight unseen is always a worry, but these are plenty long. i could even wear heels. very fun pants! i wash in cold water and hang to dry, no problem. great for travel as they dont wrinkle<br />fit nice across the booty. i feel like a million bucks when i wear these pants love it. easy to use and clean.<br />i will tell other people about that.enjoy it in daily life. thank you! perfect for knock around and casual dressy. fit great! look great, nothing wrong with them. they came earlier than i was told, so awesome delivery. the leggings look great on! fast shipping! they are very tight fitting but thats how they are supposed to be or else it won\\'t look like it should. would recommend and buy another! it is light wearing. good for  working out. thank you soft and the drawstring is functional. comfy pants. true to size. they fit but i might technically be a 4x.  love them!  want more 👍 i love these leggings. being an adventure time fan makes me love these more! they\\'re really silky and smooth. overall very comfortable and worth the purchase great fit.  love the material and they have not faded or shrunk. pick your pre-pregnancy size.  pants are very comfy, love them.  but yes, they are a bit long and needed to be hemmed 3 inches. love the way these pants look. not holding up great love them!!! get your usual size!!!! i weight 130 5\\'1 i got a medium and they fit perfect i love them. i am going to get another pair of nydj jeans, the fit is perfect! the cut,color could not as for better jeans. love nice these pants are very flattering, love the way they fit!! i am 5\\'7&#34; 155lbs i ordered the medium, fit great, a little too long but that\\'s fine with me! they\\'re a little see thru on the butt but if you wear white or tan panties it isn\\'t noticable. il be ordering another pair in a different pattern soon. ordered a medium based on reviews and found it true to size.   i\\'m 5\\'1&#34; and the length was good for me.  these would not work well for someone taller or with a longer torso but they fit me perfectly.  this is my second pair- i wear around house, for errands, to sleep.  light and comfortable and very inexpensive. as advertised warm and cozy, i love these sleep pants. i plan on ordering other prints. i wear them in summer and winter. reasonably priced and wash very nicely. love the cloth. will order again just one size smaller very excited to get my smarty pants.  they are exactly what i have been looking for!  low cut boxer style underpants to wear underneath skirts. i wasn\\'t sure about the size, so i order a l and xl.  i wear a 14/16 and the l is perfect - the xl was too big.  i will be ordering more of these.  i am stationed overseas, and they were delivered within 10 days of ordering.  couldn\\'t be happier. i\\'m 5\\'8\\'\\' and they fit perfectly,,love them!! comfortable! happy best fit, high quality soft but moderately  thick material,  so comfortable! very comfortable. i wear these around the house when i am hanging out. too long for me but i am quite short! would definitely purchase again . i love these pants! i worked out in them about an hour after getting them and they are just wonderful! the first item i bought from this company.  they fit perfectly and i want to order more from them.  i badly need new clothes.  my wardrobe is falling apart fast. i love these pants! they are so comfortable and soft! i have been wearing them around the house and they are so comfortable, that on cool nights, i actually wear them to bed too! the fit is great too! i ordered a little bigger than i normally do, so that they would be comfortable to lounge in, and they are exactly that...very comfy:) the construction of the pants, and the quality of the fabric, is so much nicer than any other lounge pants i have ever purchased in a store. besides being comfy, which is the first thing i love about the pants, the second best part is the softness, feel, and weight of the fabric. i would recommend these pants to my family and friends:) decent quality for the price. there is cats on every square inch of these leggings, they fit great, and they are the cutest cat leggings i\\'ve ever seen. love these! so dang comfy! feel like pjs but are dressy.  i love them so much i ordered in black!  for reference i am 5\\'4 and 125lbs and they fit perfect in length! these were really cute as was the tee shirt i purchased from the same vendor.  i have purchased direct from webundies before and they are an excellent company.  however, i did not see anywhere on the website page display that said these were childrens sizes...but that may have been me...anyway they were way too small for my adult daughter who normally wears the sizes i ordered.  so, the lounge pants had to be sent back and i was really disappointed. love i read the reviews to go a size up. i am 5\\'4&#34; and about 160 lbs. typically i wear a size 8 and i ordered a large. at first i had to tug to get them up but they fit perfect with some room to spare. i love them so much i ordered 2 more colors! i am curious to see how they wear over time, but since they are only $9.99 i have no problem with a shorter life span. these are so comfortable, i bought two pairs, black and navy blue. love love love them!!! very comfortable. length great and i\\'m 5\\'10. love. i get compliments anywhere i go. i\\'m 5\\'9 and tiny. these would maybe be short on a 6\\'4 person. they\\'re so long! gonna order like 5 more oh....i like these pants.  they are comfortable and stylish.  the wide-ish leg balances out my hips, so they are slimming.  i am not sure about the reviewer who thought these were sweat pants.  they are not sweat pants.  they are perfect for work.  the waist band is comfortable too.  they are not very warm, though.  also, the elastic band in the waist band rolls sometimes, but it is easy to straighten out. a little darker than expected, but they are awesome and comfy. it arrived quickly and was presented nicely in a fabric pouch. it is a great product- and i am pretty much happy with it but if i was any taller than 5\\' 10&#34; it would be too short. as it is, they are just long enough. i might switch out the elastic in the ankles to ties- as the elastic is a little too tight and cuts off circulation a little. they seem to be well made and well designed otherwise. if they made a larger size that would fit men (and women) over 5\\' 10&#34; it would probably be appreciated. other than the tight ankle elastic they are very comfortable. great fit!  i am a true plus size woman and these pants fit perfectly!  i was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable they were and at this price point. i love them so much i\\'m ordering them in every color. they are definitely thin in material so you will need to wear matching undies if you plan to wear them outside your home.  other than that, i just love them! good quality, fits well!! it´s a good fitting, but i recommend you order una size above. i was lucky as i read all the reviews and ordered m instead of s.<br />quite short, so if you a are a tall girl, i recommend you order 1 or even 2 sizes above (the difference is not that much) to make sure the lenght of the legs is appropriate. worst case scenario, you would take it to the seamstress for leg and weight adjustment. the piece is beautiful, the fabric is very nice, doesn´t look cheap at all. this is a must have, practical and easy to wear. very nice workout pants.  lots of stretch, high waist, comfortable. it was the perfect fit it feels comfortable and looks perfect! the only thing is that it is completely see through, you would need a pair of black shorts to go with it. great pants!  the material is thin. great product. arrived quickly. woo comfy and much more interesting than plain black work out pants. i ordered these to get out of the black and gray legging slump i was in. i found these to be the perfect size for me, i am currently a size 12 though i don\\'t have hips or much of a waist, and a smaller rear. these pasts flow nicely and the pattern is interesting with mauve undertones. i am ordering a cinched holman type top to wear with it in a medium purple so i can use it grocery shopping, errand running etc while still being perfectly comfy. the pattern is loud, so pair with a solid or basic top. fun and artistic.  great addition to the wardrobe.  get the light saber earrings too! amazing pants. seriously i hate to wear pants. these are awesome. they came right on time and fit exactly as i expected! i\\'m extremely happy with them!<br />i went a size up and bought a medium because i wasn\\'t sure how accurate the sizing would be and it seemed like the logical thing to do. turns out they\\'re sizing is spot on and i should\\'ve gone with a small (and in fact, i think i\\'ll buy another pair in a size small!) but i\\'m still very happy with the medium fit and am most definitely keeping them. they\\'re sooo comfortable, the material is fantastic, and i felt fabulous wearing them all night long, i got many a compliment on them. great a good fit and comfortable ,price is very good,fast service. love these! so comfortable and pretty classy looking as well, if i do say so myself. really nice purchase and the fabric isn\\'t so thick to make them uncomfortable in summer. too small to wear and it\\'s too see-through, but very nice for what it is. cute, clings to the right spots.  works well on my body which is very slim with full chest. order 2-3 sizes down. i\\'m 340lbs 5\\'6 and size 26-28 and wearing a size 22. found these originally on a plus size site marked a size  32w i was like wtf. by a diff company. then did my research and found discount jungle on amazon and fell in love with them unlike the other company they sell you what you ask for. product is amazing. super stretching. super low cut. awesome awesome fit. hugs all the right curves. will be stocking up keep filling up my size 22\\'s i\\'ll be restocking each paycheck. perfect these cropped pants are an excellent fit and look great! they are very soft and comfortable, the fabric stretches well and it\\'s not see through. very long. fit like a small rather than a medium. good quality. not as nice as victorias secret ones are. perfect these pajama bottoms are very comfortable, with a full elastic waist and adjustable drawstring tie.  the fabric is a light-medium weight cotton knit.  this item does run small.  i am a size 8 and i ordered the large.  i expcted them to be a bit roomy.  after the first time i washed and dried them, they fit just right (not tight, but form-fitting).  the fun, whimsical print and the reasonable price make this a good value. due to the cut and the slight shrinkage, i would advise ordering up one size. great! super comfortable! fast shipping these pants came with a drawstring so even though i\\'m technically a large in china (which is where the product came from) i still had to draw up the tightness a bit. still great! very sturdy although i just wore them for a costume! both the medium and the large fit fine.  medium is just a bit smaller but they stretch and are very comfortable.  i am using them for sleep pajama pants and they are soft and feel fine for sleeping.  the material is thin which works well.  not sure i would wear them out as they look a bit inexpensive as to the material.  the elastic could be a bit softer but if i tuck my shirt in it is fine. very nice as long as you order 2 sizes larger than your usual size.    also, fyi, the ones called green are really the aqua color pictured. very &#34;pajama-like&#34;. the pants are comfortable and i\\'m considering purchasing another pair. they do run long (i\\'m 5\\'6&#34;). wish i had longer legs...<br />get the darker colors as someone suggested. the light color is totally unforgivable. perfect fit. i have a medium body build and it fits every part of my waist. good for any size :) i abosolutely love these pants, so i know that my 14yr old daughter is going to love them when she opens them on xmas morning!! they are so unique & no1 in our town has them. teens love originality & that\\'s exactly what these are, original!! they didn\\'t think that they were going to arrive by xmas, but they totally did!! i am oozing w/delight from the service & the product!! i will be ordering from them again!!!!!! :) i absolutely love these pants! super comfy and breathable material! flattering, flowy pants, plenty long for my 34&#34; inseam. great across the booty<br />wash in cold water, hang to dry, so easy to care for, packs well, no wrinkles<br />love them!! package arrived on time with out any issues. the pants are slightly see through so be careful what you wear underneath. very comfortable, great beach pants. these are the most comfortable leggings on the planet. so stylish, had to buy another pair in the other color. a must have for your wardrobe. leggings  hug your body without suffocating it, the material  lining is so velvety comfortable. these leggins when worn, look like classy pants. love the fit and feel of these pants. they are a first choice for comfort around the house. they are well made and the material is such that you can feel confident and comfortable wearing them. affordable and great fit. get what you pay for. good value the way the pants look are amazing, its just that the symbols on them aren\\'t as i expected. there are nazi symbols, demonic things on it...if you aren\\'t into it, then don\\'t buy it, but if you do then go ahead. :)  although it is sorta weird when people actually come up to me and look at my pants as if they are unearthly. just be spontaneous when you wear them! i\\'m an er nurse with 10+ years and have worn dickies scrubs for years.  just enough pockets to hold all your stuff.  can\\'t go wrong with these and i highly recommend. super comfy, lots of room for movement. i wear these around the house and to do yoga in. think i\\'ll buy at least one more pair. these were supposed to come a month after i ordered them, but they came in a week! they\\'re very soft, stretchy and comfortable. i\\'m very happy i bought these according to the size chart….i should have worn xl….however they only had an xxl…so to be fair….i knew they would be large.  i inserted a 2&#34; wide elastic in the waist and that kept them perfectly from falling down.  love the print and they are very comfortable.  i wore them on valentine\\'s day and they were lovely…great buy for the price.  just wish they were a bit longer and more of a wider palazzo pant.  i would buy another pair, though. i love these pants.  i wish i had them in every color and i will be buying more.  they get so many compliments & they\\'re easy to take care of - wash & wear!  they also look exactly as pictured & fit perfectly.  i am usually medium in everything.  i would bet i could pull off a large if i gained a few, but i wouldn\\'t go smaller if i lost a few from my normal weight.  so, if you\\'re in between sizes, i might go with the larger size to see....they\\'re totally comfy too!<br /><br />the seller was great and everything arrived timely and packaged well.  very happy with this purchase! the small is a little tall for the size. soft fabric and comfy. these are very comfortable pants.  i would definitely buy more in different colors. the pants fit me perfectly. the quality is great it does not have any of that cheap feeling fabric. stretchy. true fit, well-made, and of course the convenience of the cargo design - a beloved favorite i will always have in my closet i love this outfit! it fits slightly bigger than what i wanted it to but still very wearable!! i am going to order more from this company. great price, decent shipping and great quality romper! i was expecting thinner, less quality and this is a good thickness without being heavy for summer! i have only tried it on a couple times i will update if i have problems after a wash or all day wear. good price and fit great for the wife. love love love these pants! my daughter loved her blue galaxy leggings! they are very comfortable and stretchy and they aren\\'t see through like other leggings. they arrived earlier than the expected arrival date, which is good. thank you! i thank you for offering these leggings for ladies my size.  they fit wonderfully and since i have \\'chicken\\' ankles they grip rather well. comfy! very happy with these pants nice n cumfy love these pants. they do stretch throughout the day. they are definitely not workout pants. i wore them while working out and mooned the whole room while jump roping. these are great for lounging around tho. just as long as you\\'re able to pull them up every time you stand or walk around. i love them! wish they had them in way more colors! maybe pastels great addition to my cycling comfort. super comfortable. glad i read through the reviews and bought a size smaller than i usually do, though. i\\'m usually an xl to a 2xl but bought just a large and they fit nicely. maybe it\\'s the difference between buying clothes specifically for plus sized women, which these are, and buying \\'average\\' sized designed clothes in an extra large size. daughter loves it got what i wanted, and fit great! i love these pants! love it im short and it fits nicely amazing pants!  they are very flattering, comfortable, and they fit well.  i have actually purchased these in different prints because i liked them so much.  they were the perfect length for me (i am tall and can wear my &#34;tall heels&#34; with them if i want if i don\\'t fold them over...or i can wear flats if i do). my husband hates them but i love them these pants are so attractive and comfortable.  i would recommend them for anyone who wants style and comfort.  i am 5\\'9&#34; and the length is perfect.  i can wear with sandals or a small heel. perfect i\\'m an athletic medium sized male. i personally hate the fit of most tactical pants available. too baggy. when it comes to cargo pants the side pockets are usually a little too low for my taste. i thought i\\'d give these a try. i seriously love them. i don\\'t care if they\\'re for girls. they fit me great. the material is light, comfortable. i bought several pairs. i read the sizing chart and selected my size accordingly. i do understand some comments about opaqueness, however, by picking the right size, there is enough loose material that i think you will love them. i am 5\\' 8&#34;, so i measured my inseam to make sure i picked the correct length. i was in between so i picked the longer size. they brush the ground when i am barefoot, but even my low shoes are enough to get them off the ground. i love the fit and the feel. i am glad i bought two! got these for my daughter for back to school she would usally where a 3 but these where a perfect fit definitely a cute pair of pants. true to size for the most part. fits well around my waist but is a little saggy at the knees. still, i love them and will probably get a lot of use out of them. the material is very nice! great ok, i\\'m 5\\'7&#34;.. and these are even long on me! i fell in love with these as soon as i put them on. i ordered a size large and im 180 lbs, they fit perfect! so ladies dnt hesitate.. u won\\'t regret it. i was scared at first considering i usually wear an xl and im a bit on the heavy side. megusta mucho ;) i loved them i love the print and the silky material. i ordered two different prints and really, just can\\'t beat the price! one pair fits me a tad bit better, hence the 4 star rating. i am 5 ft 10inches and weigh 145 pounds with larger hips. one pair shows my butt crack when i bend over. i was wanting to use these for yoga classes. i probably still will and just be really aware. in my playing around at home they hold up well enough to my poses. i am concerned that the seam on the one pair won\\'t last long but for this price, i\\'m ok with it. i would recommend but be aware that the sizes vary a tad. these lounge pants are sewn well, the fabric is of high quality, colors & pattern look great & goldilocks in &#34;weight&#34;.  these are not winter wear nor are they meant to be.  they fit true to size and are long but for a 5\\'3&#34; woman they shrank enough to not have to be hemmed - an inch could still come off & they\\'d be fine.  recommend highly for 100% cotton which is becoming extinct. super cheap pants but... they are super cheap pants! more or less what i expected. i am a 30 waist with a booty and the large fit perfectly. i could probably get into a medium but i went ahead and ordered the large to be on the safe side. they are comfy and fun. not a fan of the color in person, but good product bought these for an \\'80s cruise and they were awesome!  they are really comfortable like pajama pants and i love the material - stretchy and soft. they fit me well but i expected them to be a little baggy and they were a bit on the tighter side fitting like loose leggings rather than like hammer pants - the pattern will hide any body imperfections but the fabric will not. thanks i really do like these.<br />they fit just right.<br />wash like a dream.<br />take them out of the dryer and hang immediately and you\\'ll be all set.<br />then you can write a nice review! loving it! thanks for everything! fit perfect these are slightly tight, but my husband thought they looked great.  they are very cute and several folks at my yoga class complimented me on them.  they are somewhat warmer than most tights (i wouldn\\'t call them sweat pants).  very cute, though--would buy again. when i first tried on these pants i thought they were too big, too long, and just wouldn\\'t work for me (btw, i have psoriasis). i returned the second pair that i ordered.<br />i kept the other pair and decided to wear them for bed and...then i got a surprise. they did work fantastically for me...but for sleeping! they are soft, long enough to cover my ankles in bed, and just all around comfortable to sleep in.<br />i am therefore ordering another pair (this time a 6 instead of a 7). wear and wash perfectly.  when clean they are on my daughter or her friends great item fits great,love it. will buy more. adorable. i\\'ve received many compliments. planning on buying more for friends :) love these pants.they are a little see-through, and one size which make them a little snug (i\\'m a size 6ish) but they still fit and i love wearing them! does the job right. not too bulky and definitely breathable. i loved the price and the quality of the product. another great purchase. great pants. my teen loves them. others were right to suggest going up a size when ordering. daughter usually wears size large but ordered extra large and they fit perfectly. bought her 4 different colors for christmas. love the material these are great, you can dress them up or where them casual.  a great bargin!!! i had ordered these, and had actually forgotten that i did so. they were inexpensive, and just a whimsical purchase. when they arrived i tried them on, and i was quite surprised by the exact fit, and quality. the way the words are displayed is very flattering, and they are comfortable. the pants are very fun, but i will say, on the back, \\'the tragedy of hamlet\\' is written in large letters, and the actual word hamlet sits right below the rump on both sides, if you don\\'t want to draw attention to that area either skip out on these pants, or plan on wearing a longer shirt with them. perfect i guess they\\'re like palazzo pants? anyway, they\\'re super stretchy and super comfortable. fitted through the thigh (i\\'m a curvy person though) and flowy and loose everywhere else. very comfortable, fits perfect! most people might say these are &#34;somewhat large.&#34;  these run very roomy.  in fact, appleseed\\'s tends to undersize their clothing.  for me, these comfortable, roomy pants are perfection.  i could sit in them all day.<br /><br />the waistband is roomy, so the tie might be necessary for some people.  my waist is large.  the waistband is also soft enough to be unnoticeable.  many denim pants waistbands feel like being wrapped in barbed wire.<br /><br />the denim is fashionable, but comfortable.<br /><br />summary:  these pants are great for lounging and being comfortable, but they look fine out in public.  the two shades are about to become my winter wardrobe.  appleseed\\'s wide whale corduroys are equally comfortable. love this pant !!!! very comfortable! love the material made out for scrub which makes comfortable and fits as expected :)! must have, i\\'m 5\\'8 and these fit really great. these crop pants are soooooooo comfortable i would wear them to lounge, shop, and sleep in ! these kensie permanent collection 2713512 black pants are a must!...  they are generously cut !! fits exactly as expected i love these! very comfortable. i\\'m going to order more. the material is stretchy and very thin/cool for the summer.  slightly see-through but not so much that they can\\'t be worn appropriately if you wear the proper colored panties (i\\'d suggest nude/or the color of the pants in a bikini cut). i\\'d wear them to work if i could wear busy prints. i am 5 ft tall and 135 lbs. i was concerned the waist or bottom area would be tight but it was not at all. the waist comfortably folds down like yoga pants.  i am quite curvy at the hips, thighs, and butt. i ordered medium and it fit very well except i had to trim and hem them because they were too long but i expected that.  i actually trimmed them to my preferred length and wore them without hemming because i was in a hurry and they held up fine. however, i do plan to hem the edges to prevent damage and give it the finished look.  i guess it would be nice if these came in a short length but usually most things do not! other reviews said to buy these jeans a size smaller. i am a size 14 with a large butt. i got the size 14 and they fit fine. pockets are very large so they really make my butt look even bigger. only hope is for some with smaller, lower back pockets. jeans are awesome for holding in the muffin top and very soft after washing without losing their shape. just like long johns only no bulk to make your clothes feel tight.<br />can be worn around the house too. very comfortable and machine washable. this is a very nice suit.  the material is beautiful and will ware well.  the only thing i found wrong was the sizing is not correct.  i ordered a large expecting to have it altered, but the large is just a little bit small.  i would recommend this suit.  it is really nice. good fit, and great customer service! i love it very much if you are lookung for very thin material these are oerfect light weight pants. wore this out to dinner, movie then to club. was very comfortable the whole evening. love the feel of the material. wore with thong and felt covered. i\\'m 5\\'10. wore with ankle high gladiator sandals. with one fold of waist, just below belly button the hem hit just above the top of foot which allowed to show a little of my cute sandals. lots of complements. great buy love these costume pants.  they look like they have this weird dark line mid-thigh in the picture, but they do not look like that in person.  they are really adorable. i wish they were a little thicker but they are still nice exercise or lounge pants.  they look good and are very comfortable.  they are a little long but i have to cut off lots of the pants i get so its not a big deal to me. fit as expected oh, wow.  these pants are so great.  they\\'re nice and heavy, (indicating quality), and there are nice little details. to help others with ordering -- i am about 5\\'4\\\\\\\\\", and i usually wear a 7/8 in pants.  i like low-waisted pants that give me room and don\\'t squeeze my belly.  so i did as others suggested and ordered super small --- i ordered size xs, and they are a great fit for me, and still a bit roomy, but i like them that way.  i would definitely buy another pair of these! this has to be one of the greatest things i\\'ve ever bought. it fits like a dream (i\\'m 5\\'2&#34;, 110 lbs) and its perfect! it\\'s just so cute! the one thing that is a little weird is that when the fabric is stretched the print does fade, but it still looks amazing! comfortable and cute.  slightly stretchy material makes them moveable and comfortable to sit or stand.  zipper has a tiny gap at top that is annoying but not noticeable if you don\\'t know it\\'s there. fits small, i ordered a size up. not super stretchy, but love that they are cotton and can\\'t beat the price. lava red is a great color - a true red. excellent seller, everything perfect i recommend it! i read the reviews and ordered a size x-large (normally wear a medium). they fit perfectly! the are nice and long (i am tall and always have trouble getting leggings/jeggings that are long enough) and feel very soft and comfortable. i like the brown color and plan to wear a beige chunky sweater with these. i got these pants right on time. they are super comfy. a little see thru (as the reviews said) but got a size bigger so they dont stretch out as much. will be ordering more colors. for sure! very comfy and awesome quality!! very comfortable! it is very comfortable and looks beautiful.<br />it is simple and elegant and a lot of styles can be pulled  with it.<br />i wore with with a light sequins jacket and it looked so good. i got black and tried with  different colored  jackets<br /> the soft material and the quality is great. it fits perfect and compliments my body.<br />i love the style, the material ,the quality, everything is exceptional.<br />i was provided maitai womens strapless wide leg solid tube casual jumpsuit at discounted price in return for my honest opinion. these are great every day, work pants! they look nice and feel great and they have pockets. what more can you want? i\\'ve only washed them once and they came out great. i\\'m short and expected them to be way too long but when i roll them a bit at the waist, they were perfect. i had heard they shrunk but i couldn\\'t tell it which is why i ordered the regular length rather than petite. i will for sure be getting several more pairs of these. great value! love these pants!  they are comfortable and long enough to wear with a heal or can be pulled up higher to fit nicely with flats. i\\'ve had a hard time finding this type of pant. these yoga pants are good quality for the price. nice to wear around the house or out in public :) well made, not super thick but substantial enough that you can\\'t see thru them and they are very stretchy, i can tuck in my tee without them feeling to tight these are the perfect size and perfect length. they\\'re super comfortable as well and can fit my african thighs (it\\'s always hard to find pants that can.)<br /><br />but if you have a dog like me, be careful with the pants and their fur: these pants attract my dog\\'s fur like there\\'s no tomorrow. i\\'m thinking of ordering another pair so i can have one for home and one for outside. they look great. fabric is a bit thin but good for summer. delivery was a little bit slow but was expected from the last comment i read.<br /><br />the leggings are warm and flexible. i liked it overall. these scrub pants fit perfectly i was unsure if they would be long enough they are so comfortable and fit so nice i bought another pair! i do love the cotton kiss pj\\'s! size down. i love these pants but ended up getting a size smaller in other colors because they are quite stretchy and roomy. the colors are more vibrant in person. i love love these pants. i was a little skeptical cause of some of the posts on these pants but i got them and love them they are comfy, and can easily be dressed up. dress pants are soo hard to come by and these are perfect...and they got here super fast. these leggings are super comfy. they fit to actual size. they ate a bit thinner than i thought but ate not see through. i\\'m 5\\'4&#34; 140lbs and size med fits perfectly. i really hesitated to buy from this seller bc i wasnt sure if the sizes ran small but im really satisfied with this purchase! i wear 13/14 in juniors and 12 in misses and the large fits perfect! the pic looks like more of a cotton material but they are more like spandex and really great quality, i would definitely recommend this seller and these pants! love these pants, i dont want to take them off.  very comfortable and nice fit. fits very well. my measurements are at the lower end of the large size and it fits very comfortably. love the product for wearing under my sundresses. another reviewer said she found the lace scratchy, but that is not my experience. these are so cute and comfortable but,  they run really really big.  i cant even keep them up wit out tucking them into my bra. that doesn\\'t always work so i have to wear a waist  trainer to keep them up.  but i plan on getting them in every print i possibly can afford to.  love them true black, easy wash and dry plus a great design for me. i dislike anything with a \\'tight\\' fit but these capris have a neat front fit that allows for both comfort and style. the waist band gives one the option to tuck in a top . . . small buttons above the ankle add that \\'finished look.\\' the pockets add convenience. i am 5\\'2&#34;, weigh 115 pounds and measure 62&#34; around shoulder, through crotch and back to shoulder. size 8 is just perfect for me. the fabric \\'holds\\' a crease if that is your choice . . . easy fit that looks and feels just right. i was surprised to find these at such a low price . . . not \\'seconds\\' or \\'irregular!\\'  definitely recommended. these are appropriate for most ages . . . i\\'m 68 years old and the compliments have been fantastic! received numerous compliments on these.  super comfortable.  quite long so i had to wear fairly high heels. for girlie horse lovers who love comfort and coziness.  all the people who i given these to as gifts want seconds please! these were a good fit. they are soft and very comfortable. just the right length too. keep me warm in this cold weather! very cute but too short. i\\'m 5\\'5 and they just hit my ankles. got them for my sister and she loved them love the fit and will order more. love\\'um.  so comfy! they r nice on i like them a lot not 2 lng 4 me cos im short they r gd thanx these pants are so comfortable!  they fit perfectly and look great!  i wouldn\\'t mind purchasing more pairs of these!  i love them! they are pretty decent .. they are thinner than expected but over all really cute!! they do however tend to stretch out a bit thru the day but i do love them despite the tiny flaws i just love it . they are not transparent and that\\'s what i really liked about i really liked the color and fit of these pants the only downfall is that they don\\'t wash well, it shrinks a bit and the elastic twists in the band. i would recommend these pants just air dry and leave out of the dryer. very comfortable and soft i am 5\\'9 and 150 pounds so i am relatively slender but not rail thin....if you are on the shorter side you will have to hem these pants. they come right to my feet and fit perfectly. i ordered a large and it was snug around the hips and thighs, but not too tight. i have an issue with dress pants where there is so much extra fabric in the butt and crotch area and it drives me crazy. the waist fit perfectly. i wear in jeans typically an 8 or a 10 so i believe a large is a great fit for that size range. if the seller got more of these pants in large i would buy them in a heart beat. if though you have a bigger rear these pants may be a bit snug. i don\\'t really have a &#34;large&#34; behind and they are perfectly snug so i could see it being too small for others. i debated whether to get the small or medium. i got the medium, and it fits great! i am about 5\\'8 to 5\\'9 and 125 pounds. the fabric isn\\'t see through like some other palazzo pants i own. the length is great! i can rarely find pants long enough. i definitely would purchase from this seller again!<br /><br />p.s. unlike some other people, the pattern on my pants matched up perfectly. okafit these pants are so comfortable, easy to wash and the color is rich! they don\\'t fade. also, don\\'t put them in the dryer, and they will stay wrinkle free. love!!!! maybe too expensive great quality and fit. highly recommend these pants are well made, and super cute. the colors are very bright and eye catching. bought two pairs,in orange and turquoise, and love them! they do run a little short, but otherwise fit ok. love these pants this product is true to size and holds its shape and color after many washes.  i\\'ve had them for about six months now, and they still fit nicely and have a dark black color to it.<br /><br />i would definitely buy these again! i love these i only wish they had black. i order the xl and i\\'m 5\\'9 215 they fit perfect every where but my waist. i have a 30 inch waist so that could be why, nothing a belt can\\'t fix though. i saw other reviews saying they were short but mine hit me right at the bottom of my foot. the material is soft and a little thin, great for those who live in florida where it doesn\\'t get to cold. she loved them! after my friend wore them, she decided the next size up would be better. so, i ordered 2 more larger pair. love the fabric but they run a little long love the pants,  they were very comfortable and had more than enough pockets.  got the talls but were still to short though, but i have that problem with just about any pants.  only 4 stars because they wore out after only 5 months (unsewable wholes due to wear) a little stiff, but overall really cute and feel nice. i own four pairs of these pants in different colors. instant favorites. the thing i will say about this one is the design is too low. reading further, you\\'ll understand why that\\'s a problem. even so, i gave them four stars because they are still very cute and extremely comfortable.<br /><br />organic cotton with a generous percentage of spandex make these pants very comfy with plenty of give for even the most extreme moves/stretches. a few things that are not obvious that should be considered:<br /><br />1. it\\'s not obvious from the write-up or picture that these have a fold-over waist. i actually prefer that because it adds more structure in the lower abdomen without becoming constricting in any way.<br /><br />2. if you\\'re not a giraffe, these will be long on you. i love them so much i\\'m going to add cuffs! not kidding ... i\\'m 5\\'10\\\\\\\\\" with average legs, not long but certainly not short legs either. it\\'s not uncommon for me to have to let out pant legs on business casual wear. i measured the inseam and it\\'s 38\\\\\\\\\" !!! then when you put them on, they stretch a bit more. it might be because the fabric has so much give in it? i don\\'t know but these have an extra 6\\\\\\\\\" more than i need ... pausing for that to sink in ... 6 inches extra.<br /><br />all of that said, the colors are vibrant which is lovely. as you might imagine, these should be washed separately for at least the first three trips through the laundry. cold water is a must to help keep/set as much of the color as possible. these new leggings are fabulous! i get comments on them all the time. they are so comfortable, i wear them alot. i hope to buy more in the near future! fits well and color holds during washing (on cold) they are thin so make sure you wear something underneath so you are not exposed.  but they are very different and very cool. i am looking forward to wearing them when the weather gets warmer. these pants are a very nice fit on my lovely gf and i guess i\\'ll buy some more in the near future. material is somewhat cheap other than that theyre good workout pants. i love it, but is it too small she loved them but a bit smaller than expected very comfy for maternity wear! i was hesitant about buying these cargos as i wasn\\'t sure of the fit and have a hard time finding pants that fit right. i read through the reviews and decided to take a chance. i\\'m so happy i did, they fit perfect! i am about 5\\'4 and 110 lbs, i ordered the size us2 and they are not tight and not long. they are heavier than i thought but that\\'s ok because i will be wearing them as a jeans substitute 😊  i\\'m going to buy another pair in the tan color as i got the black ones first. the shipping was really quick also. i was expecting to have to wait at least a week but they were on my doorstep on day 2.  i\\'m so excited and very pleased. i ordered these and i love them!! perfect fit! super comfy! love !!!! i bought these with a bit of hesitancy as many reviews said that the fit was large or that they stretched out over time. however, mine fit great, and i was really, really pleased with the price. i gave them 4 stars only because, well, they\\'re not the highest quality pants i\\'ve ever purchased. these boot straps work exactly as advertised.  i like to use them when i\\'m just running out of the house and don\\'t have skinny jeans or leggings on and want to throw boots on over my sweats, wider legs jeans.  would definitely recommend. great quality great looking silver pants just what i wanted but have to return and order 2 sizes larger.  are canadians smaller than americans?  don\\'t think so as i am canadian. very good great product, great fit, good quality love these scrub pants! so comfortable and have lots of pockets! it is worth the money! cute cute cute.. just gotta find the matching top now. love the way it fits; form fitting but still loose and comfortable. very worth it... i just received 1 pair of the solid black pants yesterday, i tried it on real quick, and i didn\\'t want to take it off! so, i washed it on cold, immediately removed from washer, placed it in the dryer (delicate/gentle cycle) with a few other items that were made with similar fabrics for just 20 minutes, then let it hang dry the rest of the way. this is my usual routine for items like that.<br />anyway, once it was dry, i changed my clothes just so i can get them back on! it\\'s so comfortable and feels so smooth! another great thing about it is that i can wear it at home just to lounge and sleep in or i could see myself wearing it out with sandals, flip-flops, or flats and with a 3/4 or a long sleeve basic, layered, or wrap top. even though i can\\'t wear high heels, i bet it would look great with short or tall high heels or boots.<br /><br />so far, i think this is worth the $20 i spent! after i have these washed more than once & i wear it for a few times and if i notice anything bad about it, i will update this comment. love these. i am 5&#34;8\\' and 120 lbs and these fit perfectly. i always have trouble finding pants that fit in waist and length because of my long legs. these fit great and are super comfy. these leggings were thin but good quality for the price. they fit true to size and came faster than expected. the packaging was also very cute. i would recommend buying from this seller. nice and comfy....would recommend! not a bad price either....these should last me a while! i love my comfy womfy\\'s! :) love these! very soft, thin fabric. they keep the shape. the bottoms of the legs are tight enough to stay up on your calves. butt looks great. good fabric,  very soft.  fits as expected. these are the most comfortable pants i own and i plan to buy a couple of more pairs! they are so soft and flowing that i can wear them all the time. this leggins is mega thin! however,it stretch and fit really well. also looks much better than normal leggins.  i like this. great style . can\\'t wait to wear it she really liked them and they look great lying on the bedroom floor! just ok. after reading numerous mixed reviews regarding sizing, i ordered my normal size, small.  i\\'m 5\\'1&#34;, 105lbs and usually wear a 00/0, xs, petite or reg. and occasionally, a junior size 1.<br /><br />i wanted comfy casual yet cute with a semi-loose fit (low on hips, straight cut thru legs) - these pants deliver.  durable cotton (not too thin like sheet cotton but not as thick as true military cotton) with little to no stretch.  can be worn long or cropped.  adequate boxed pockets will add a bit of bulk to your butt (or conceal an already big butt, if that\\'s your desire).  all around everyday utilitarian pants that in no way would i ever consider &#34;dressy&#34;.  these are not the pants if you\\'ve got a lot physically you want to hide - these add thickness and bulk so i personally wouldn\\'t suggest these if you\\'re more than the standard american size 6, as these pants are truly cut for a more slender frame all around.<br /><br />already ordered and received a second pair (black cargos are hard to find in my size).  the army green pair i first received is not a true army green but i suspect it will fade some and soften up with each washing.  great price and quick delivery for a quality product that should last for many years with the proper care. the print feels like it may wash out over time, but overall they are great! love the style and fit and i\\'m 5\\'9&#34; and 160 lbs. these are incredibly comfortable. the size is accurate & the legs are long, which i had hoped would be the case based on the picture, & was pleasantly surprised to find they lived up to that. i\\'m so impressed by how nice they are & will be ordering another pair right away. like them i absolutely love these. definitely buying more. nice high wuality fabric and not see through. love these pants! so unique! i ordered a medium ( i\\'m between a 4-6 us size) and it fits, but fits slightly snug if i\\'m holding water weight, so just fyi. these are the best feeling pants i\\'ve ever purchased.  just got them.  don\\'t know how they will wash over time.  but so far, loving them and am considering getting more. as pictured, cute and comfy.  the pocket lining was like paper before they were washed, but after the lining is soft and strong.  i love the color and for the price they are good quality. look sexy! fits great once you get the right size.  it runs small so you have to go up a size.  i had to go up two sizes. this pants were a great buy.  they are stretchy and breathable.  i normally don\\'t go for a &#34;salmon&#34; color, but they match perfectly with a top that i had recently purchased. perfect i bought a size up and was really glad i did. haven\\'t washed it yet but looks fine so far. not only are these pants made well but the price is exceptional!! i was worried about the sizing but followed the sizing instructions and they fit perfectly! i love these!!!! i purchased two pairs of these lounge pants after reading a review from target online.  when the pants arrived, i couldn\\'t believe how soft and comfortable they were.  i fully intend to order more of these lounge pants, and can\\'t wait to receive them! love these pants and they are so comfortable i ordered a pair of charcoal and a pair of black in size small, they fit me well! i\\'m 5\\' 4&#34; and 120 lbs. the pants are soft and stretchy although maybe a little thinner material than i was expecting but still worth the price!! i will mention however that the black pair seemed to shrink lengthwise after a few washes (but not the charcoal) and the black pair sort of shows fuzzies a lot. love it!!! fast shipping and they fit perfectly! i would order up 1 or 2 sizes.  i normally wear a 6 and i ordered xxl/size 10.  they fit perfectly and are very flattering.  i like that they are higher without being too high.  the waist is a little forgiving and can be tightened if needed.  i would buy more if they came in other colors. great soft diner but they are a little large for me... just going to take them up a bit. could not get them in a smaller size when i ordered them. but that is okay.. perfect fit,  took note from other reviews and ordered the petite short. if you just order short they will be to long. nice material and fit okay, slighty big, hopefully they shrink a tad in wash. great fit and made very well.  will purchase from them again. these pants feel and fit great! so comfy but not big and baggy. i ordered a large and i\\'m in between a 14/16.<br />the blue is a pretty color and i got so many compliments. i wore them on an extremely hot and humid day and i felt so cool and comfortable in them. might get some more colors.... these are great work pants, they hold all kinds of small tools that i need to do my job. very cute these jeans are so comfortable and they go with everything i wear, tops and shoes, boots, everything! they really are fantastic. beautiful love these pants, no matter the color. thank god they come in talls. i\\'m 5\\'8&#34; with long legs and they fit perfectly. the pockets are the best part. i\\'m 5\\'3\\\\\\\\\", 140 lbs and purchased these for an event coming up (bodypump launch). i\\'m supposed to dress up in my best 80s attire and these work perfectly. they have stirrups and are not skin tight. slightly baggy in the lower half of the leg but not complaining. i\\'d rather them fit as they do than be skin tight like tights. they have a stretchy elastic waistband that can come fairly high as well. hope this helps! i was worried the material would make them feel too much like a costume but that\\'s not the case. i\\'ll stick these away to wear for anything \\\\\\\\\"80s\\\\\\\\\" in the future! i just love my pants<br />very comfortable and chic!<br />going to buy another pair for my sister i like these pants. i will say that this pair have a fairly low rise so if you are looking for something that stops right at the bikini line then this is for you. i am 5\\'4 180pds and i ordered the x-lg. fits a little lose but very wearable. if you are between sizes i recommend to size down. these pants have plenty of stretch in the to compensate. hope this helps. fits great, i should have chosen black instead of brown but other than that i have no real complaints about this item. arrived on time and in excellent condition. stretchy and fit nice. extremely comfortable capri leggings. they look and feel great!  breathable fabric makes these one of my favorite pieces of work out gear. i highly recommend. i got this last year and always received compliment anytime i wear it. it fit as expected and i love the scarf! these shrank more than i expected but were still alright. they do run small. amazing fit and i really like that it has a finished hem. great pants! love them great very pleased.  have 4 pairs now and just love them.  need to handwash separately as they will &#34;bleed&#34; especially the darker colored pants i have a love hate relationship with these pants. they are comfortable!!! but they look like yoga pants which means i can not wear them to work. i do no like them because the fabric is so thin they are pretty much see through. be careful with the sizing its a hit or miss, i wear mostly large but went with a extra large because of not fitting as expected. but if you are looking for a comfortable pair of pants to run around the house in these are awesome! i love these pants. very comfortable i bought these as a birthday present for my sister. they fit her like a glove and she looks great in them. the only (tiny) issue is that the button hole was not actually a hole, it was sewn together. this was an easy fix, and they are now her favorite shorts i love these pants.  they are comfortable and well made.  the colors are just beautiful!!!! they are just not what i expected.  oh, there\\'s nothing \\\\\\\\\"wrong\\\\\\\\\" with them, but the fit isn\\'t quite right, the size doesn\\'t run true and they feel bigger/looser that i would have liked. this brand has the best quality bamboo clothing i have found so far, and i have tried most of the brands.  nice thick fabric and no pilling.  fits as expected, love these pants. these pants are so comphy! they are a little long but all you have to do is cut the bottoms to you length. the pants are exactly as pictured. much better than uniform pants i have had before. quality fabric and construction. also, they are more attractive and proffessional in appearance. couldn\\'t be happier and i will buy them again . just perfect,is what my wife calls them. i was hesitant to buy these with the low rating but saw the statement by the manufacturer stating they use thicker material now, so i gave it a chance. i\\'m glad i did, i love the pink and purple colors, i wear a large and thay fit perfect. i would buy again, if they don\\'t live up to my rating i will edit mt feedback. very nice pants. unfortunately had to return because they were way too small. very fast shipping and refund from seller!! i love them even though i am a man i think i look so sexy in them :) very comfortable and fit perfectly! i love my pants that i purchased; they are very comfortable and light-weight.<br />you wear them either dressed up or casual. i appreciate it very much. i love the color.  i also purchased the black the 7/8 and it feels tighter than all the others. otherwise,  i love the jeans and quality of it. this color is just as i expected. they are lightweight but not see through.  extremely long,  i am  5\\'5 and had to hem them almost 4 inches. besides that i would buy from the seller again.  product arrived as promised. good item for price wonderfully soft!  a gift for my teenage daughter and she adores them! i ordered these in a size small.  i\\'m 5 feet tall and typically a size 6.  the pants fit me very well but were too long even with 4 inch wedge sandals.<br />i will have to get them hemmed but the pants are worth it.  very soft, casual but still nice enough to wear to work!  and the price was great! fine good quality for what you pay for. my second pair from them and certainly not my last !! will by again. love the color but l fits like a m it fitted very nice, good lycra, cute for lounge and costumes!! great yoga pant. love these stretchy lightweight pants. i\\'ve been struggling with the sizing of the palazzo style pants.  ordered a large and it swallowed me....literally.  so when i ordered these pants i went with a small which actually works!  i love the fact i am wearing a small, haven\\'t been able to say that in years...lol.<br /><br />just make sure that you order these keeping in mind that they run quite large. this item fits as expected i really love this pants, i can\\'t wait the moment to use it. this was the first time i ordered from women within. the item was as described and shipping was fast. the material of the pants is soft and lightweight. i ordered a 2x which is the size i wear usually, but these were big. should of ordered a 1x. b i\\'ve been looking everywhere for a pair of cat printed leggings. when i came across these, i knew i had to get them, and i\\'m so happy i did! first off, yes these leggings are covered with cute cats, and these cat also have inverted crosses on their heads but that\\'s what makes them so great! the first night i wore them i got nothing but compliments. all my friends loved them! strangers even asked where i got them.<br />they are also super comfortable and are a little darker in person, but i personally think the picture makes them look washed out, but really, they\\'re great!<br />they fit great too! i\\'m 5\\'3\\\\\\\\\" and around 130lbs, and they look great on me if that helps with size.<br />as for shipping, it did take a while to come in, but it was only about 2 weeks.<br /><br />overall, i\\'m very happy about this purchase! if you\\'re looking for a unique pair of leggings that are worth it, these are just for you!<br />hope this review helps!! i love these capris they are just what i was looking for.  they fit great also. can i say that i love love love these pants!!!! thaey super comfortable and super cute!!! i did order them in a large as most recommended,  normally i\\'m a medium,  i\\'m 5`5 and 140lbs. the larges fit great, snug but still movable.  im ordering 2 more pair! love these pants! so comfortable and super cute! great for her katnis everdeen costume! i love love love these!! i am 5 months pregnant and was looking for comfy yoga pants that wouldn\\'t squish my belly. i bought 3 pair about a month ago and i am back to buy more. i seriously love them. super comfortable. i wear them all the time. not just for being at home but out to run errands. also i was expecting them to be thin based on previous review. but they werent. i am very happy. i would recommend these to everyone. i am 5\\'6&#34; and bought a large also i am about 190. perfect for the price i think these pants are great.  i wanted something to sit around in the evenings instead of pyjamas and these do the trick. love these pants. i did order a size smaller than i usually wear but they fit great i wish they werent so long but other than that i love these seriously theyre flattering and really cute! i\\'m slowly collecting every color i like in these. i absolutely adore these pants. i\\'ll be honest i\\'m really picky about what i wear and i normally don\\'t wear leggings. it\\'s really hard to find leggings that fit me right. i was surprised i really liked these and they fit great. they are really well made and i see them lasting a long time. they are very comfortable and i was afraid these would make me sweat bad but they don\\'t. i love that these have 2 pockets. they are small but at least they have pockets. they are zipper style pockets so you don\\'t have to worry about your things accidently falling out. the color of these don\\'t fade easily. these are kind of heavy but being heavy makes them not ride up in the wrong places. overall a great pair of plus size pants that i highly recommend. i received for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. great product!  arrived on time love them so comfortable !! i ordered a few sizes larger than i normally wear so they would be looser when i sit and sew during the day for the public. i don\\'t mind that they are see-thru because i work at home. the waist on these is as wide as the hip area so i am going to run a narrow elastic in there to make it fit me and stay up. they also have to be hemmed up a few inches. will probably order more but a smaller size. they just need a little tinkering with to make them fir right. my daughter is thin and hates when pants don\\'t fit her just right in the waist, so she loves leggings and jeggings. she hated her school uniform pants, so when i saw these i bought a test pair, and she loves \\'em. they are good quality, thick, and look just like regular uniform pants. they even have belt loops. she\\'s been wearing them nonstop and washed them a bunch and they are surviving wonderfully, so i bought two more pair. well worth the price! i would usually wear an xl, but i held them up to me and they looked big...so i bought a large, and they are even too big.  i would go down a size, or maybe two... when ordering these.  they are really cute and comfortable, but i promise you they run big!! sheer a bit big but has a tie so it works! comfy and great to cover up dimples on the.thighs! lol nice fit i bought the middle earth one and it fits awesome, the fabric quality is surprinsingly great i\\'m truly satisfied. saddly i did not like too much the color tone of the legging. having the dress i though it was going to be more goldlish like the picture (and like the dress) but is more brownish that\\'s why i only give them 4 stars. about the size i use to wear i\\'m 114 pounds i wear 26 in jeans a regular s and honestly it fits perfect for me good fit, super comfortable, great for travel i have a 29-30 inch waist and i got this in medium and it fits me well. i think a small would be a tight snug fit too. but i prefer the medium. the length is not too long or short. it stops exactly an inch below my ankles. i am 5\\'5&#34;. the closure is through buttons instead of hooks. the leg is in boot cut shape. hand wash with cold water is recommended for the pants. the waist band is 2.5&#34; wide. the fabric did not shrink after wash. overall, these are comfortable to be worn all day long.<br />sample provided without any obligations. love these pants. i will need to hem them because they are too long. i\\'m only 5\\'1\\'\\'. but not much. the fabric is nice and comfortable. the colors are awesome, just right for someone that likes to be flashy. good quality, very comfortable. i loved the comfortable fit, and the smooth look.  the wide legs accented my outfit giving me a distinctive style. the small fit great through hip ind leg..felt like it pulled a smidgen..ordered a med. also..sold the small to a fellow nurse! great i bought these in black and am going to get the red now. they are super comfortable and perfect for what i wanted. i wear them for social/casual ballroom dancing with ballroom dance heels and a black short sleeve shirt with fun details (lace or fringe, etc). the pants are the perfect length for me (i\\'m 5\\'7) and they keep me cool. they also make my butt look great! i just love this tights.they are super sexy nice pants. good fit and nice color. kinda thin but that\\'s how clothes are made now. will buy again love, love, love these! wish they came in more colors! very comfortable and warm.  didn\\'t shrink when washed.  if i don\\'t have plans to go out, i wear them all day!!  would buy again. perfect for wintertime pj\\'s.  love them!  i washed them 3 times since i purchased them - and they are still a-1. loved the fit,first wash falling apart they look so much better in person and they fit like jogging pants are supposed to fit i really liked the quality of the flannel and the feminine detail of the satin ribbon waist ties and trim. it holds up well when laundered and is an above average quality product for the price these run very small. they said to order a size up from your normal size but even doing that these were to small.  other than that issue i feel these pants are very well made, held up through washing and look great!  they are nice and light and would be perfect for working in the summer.  easy to dress up with a blouse or down with a tshirt.  i received this item at a discount in exchange for my hones review. girl loved it looks great good material she was very impressed.😄 a little long but other than that they are perfect! bought 3 pairs, one for mom and two for me. two were much longer in length (2 inches) and did not shrink after cold washing and no dryer. one pair did shrink up after same treatment. they are thin, comfy, fun and inexpensive. in stores they sell for up $30 on their \\\\\\\\\"as seen on tv shelf\\\\\\\\\". light weight and perfect!!! awesome keeper. i love these paints ! they fit me good & they are comfortable ! very comfortable love it perfect fit i love them they are very comfortable a little larger cut than similar brands but good quality. the belt works great and is easily adjustable.<br />i can never leave with out it. its a real head turner. these fit perfectly, and are so soft.  the material is wrinkle resistant as stated,and hangs very nicely.  they are more figure flattering than other scrubs, i am ordering more today. bien couldn\\'t be happier with purchase these pants are a silky material, but very thin (you can see your undergarments) with a giant bellbottom pant leg. very 70\\'s. not quite my style..don\\'t think i\\'ll be going out of the house with these, but good for lounging and sleeping in. they fold over at the top easily which i like. great length as well. i\\'m 5\\'7. they fit nicely and seem comfortable but they are see a thin material, so they are see through. the pants came in really huge but i like how roomy it is and i can tighten the band around enough so it stays put haha. i like it love these very comfortable pants. they are longer than i expected but they have a nice cut. color is very pretty. these pants are a little long but very comfortable. the waistband folds over just fine but i had to remove the tag because it was very uncomfortable. i love these! nicely made and super comfortable! light weight so i can wear them out on a summer day. i usually wear a medium but i ordered a size up and got a large which fit perfectly. i\\'m looking to get more pairs in different designs! comfy and great thank you... love them<br />just as pictured love it the photo shows a small slit at the knee and the shorts i received do not have that. i love these pants! they look just like the picture and they are so comfortable to wear too. yes, they are long but that is how i like them. i wish they made them in more colors. these are incredibly comfy. the only reason its down to 4 stars is because its too thin. i bend over and you can easily see my undies and skin around it. i\\'m pregnant and i have some of another brand so i knew exactly what i wanted. if the material were thicker then i\\'d be happy to leave five stars. my new favorite scrub pants! after 4+ years of army nursing wearing my combat uniform (yes, really - no scrubs), i picked up a per diem job at a local trauma center and decided to refresh my scrub wardrobe. i happened across these at a scrub shop and fell in love with the fit and utility! love them. thanks for making petite sizes for the shorties, too. i am barely 5\\' tall and these are about perfect! i like these leggings because they hold me in yet they are comfortable around the waist.  i thought they were a bit costly, however. they look great, feel fantastic. it\\'s really nice looking! these are really cute, just was not crazy about how i looked in them. there is nothing really wrong with these pants and the colors are nice. when i loose about 5#s i\\'ll probably reorder. my husband has requested i purchase more of these. wish they would keep their stock up. love the print i saw the wide leg pants on pinterest.  they were the green &#34;jade&#34; color.  i am a size 4 and after reading the reviews i decided to order them in medium.  i received them yesterday and they really do run small.  when i first put them on i was a little worried because they were snug going over the thighs and hips but they fit perfectly.  there is no wiggle room but they are comfortable. i think the large would have worked too as i like a loose fit that sits below the waist.  the color is not the same shade as it appears on the site.  i ordered \\'awp36_jade\\' and the color is more vibrant like the color of \\'awp93_jade\\'.  the material and quality is nice and i will order other colors.  great pants for summer. great fit even though i\\'m very short. not too long because of snug fit around ankle. very comfortable in the gym. wonderful pockets. cell phone fits. definitely recommend i was looking all over for nice, light-colored pants for work.  maybe because it was the middle of winter, but i couldn\\'t find anything that wasn\\'t black.  so i came to amazon, having tried on a pair of calvin klein pants in another color in a store -- i knew what size would fit and i could get the color i wanted.<br /><br />these are a standard size for the brand.  they fit well and appear to be very well made.  they\\'re actually quite a bit nicer in person than i had expected, as well.  these are lined and they are a very soft fabric (but they can still hold a crease if you\\'re into ironing).  i got them just a bit long so i could wear them with heels or wedges and they\\'re working great for that.<br /><br />these are probably going to be best for cooler weather because of the lining -- i had to scrape frost off my car this morning but these pants kept my legs warmer than any of my unlined pants.  definitely glad i bought these -- the only thing i\\'m not thrilled with is that they are dry clean only.  (i am going to be handwashing and hope they hold up.) i ordered a pair of these cargo pants in black, and they are very comfortable, like a nice pair of sweats, but the length is too short by several inches for me.<br /><br />the description says they are for women up to 5\\'11, but i\\'m 6\\'1\\\\\\\\\".  i ordered a pair thinking the extra inches usually afforded to tall pants would allow me to wear these without a problem.<br /><br />but, wearing these makes it look like i\\'m waiting for a flood.  so if i want to wear these in public i have to roll the legs up to below my knees so they look like long shorts.<br /><br />these would be perfect if there were only a few more inches added to the legs for us tall tall gals. my daughter needed these for a jazz number in a play, and they were perfect. fun, good quality. we have a friend who\\'s had several pair for different needs and loves them as well. best quality perfect fit...just as i expected... i love koi\\'s scrub pants. they fit well, are comfortable, lots of pockets and i think they look good. i am 5\\'3&#34; so petite is just the right length. the color doesn\\'t fade after washing constantly. they are more expensive then other brands, but i think it\\'s worth it. they run a little big, but are very nice and soft. these are well made, nice fabric, and tall enough for five foot seven.  they wash and wear well without a lot of crumpling around the pockets. these pants are a great value!i\\'m 5\\'8\\\\\\\\\" and 150ish lbs, decided to go with the large even though i normally wear a medium, based on other buyers comments. love the fit, love the length, thinking about getting another pair in another color. the black ones are nice - easy to dress up or down. very versatile. i bought these to wear during my pregnancy. they fit well and were very comfortable. the waist stretched out enough to go around my belly. now that i\\'m not pregnant they fit normal and i can still wear them. great everyday item! comfy these pants feel amazing. the fabric is so soft and swishy. i call them my gypsy pants. and my friends call me &#34;miss jasmine&#34; when i wear them. (like from aladdin) i will say though, get a size or two larger than what you normally wear. i went a size up (after reading reviews and comparing my personal measurements to the sizing chart) and they fit perfectly. i put them on the moment they arrived and wore them all night long. so comfy. i wear them to parties, to class, to workout, and to just lounge around. i will definitely be buying more colors. awesome! makes my ass look great! fits well, looks good. love them. they shape my body very well. they come up ove your stomach so you can wear a tight shirt under or a poose shirt over it i loved these with all of my being! id freaked out over them for awhile and eventually ordered em an they were exactly perfect! wonderful printing that isnt blurry or stretched.. yodas face looks just as lovely on my thigh as it does on the screen love the suite !!  it is thinner than i was expecting and runs a bit small.  i usually wear a small and read the reviews and ordered a medium.  it still fits tight and would like to exchange it for a large simply for little more comfort.  but the company does not allow exchange.  it is more of a t-shirt type fabric.  very comfortable but not has heavy material as i was expecting. not too bad for the price. i ordered the medium because the small was just a little too small for sleepwear...the med. fit perfectly and i am very happy overall, the price, the fit, the cute design, and just light enough to keep the hot flashes at bay.. (my husbands name is stephen, he doesn\\'t have hot flashes.) loving it these pants are comfortable and fit me very well! (i\\'m 5\\'2&#34;, 110lbs) the elastic is soft and flexible to fit other sizes too, i\\'m sure. the color is slightly more green than pictured, but i figured it would be by the description, and i am very pleased! comfortable and well made! material is soft and great to wear. the colors are bright and cheerful. i would purchase them again. i loved the pants but they were a bit too small.  i returned them without a problem and i might order a larger size in the future. i\\'m 5\\'5\\'\\' and 110lbs normally i wear size 2 regular or 25 or 26 jeans depends on brands, anyhow based on reviews i order this in size 28 which was big mistake. i should\\'ve order it 26 or 27. regardless the design is really cute except the back pockets it is kind of far apart. other than that it is a nice cargo pants and very comfy love it very comfortable nice!! these are so very soft and comfortable to wear! the thickness is nice and i would recommend considering purchasing a size smaller than usual because they are very roomy and there is a gentle elasticity to the waist so not much to hold them up if they are too big. while some may claim that it is a poor craftsman who blames his tools, i firmly believe that rojas the denim acid wash drop pant,pants for women will be my key to finally dethroning frank bartlett as the world record holder in ferret legging.  roomy and spacious enough for a family of four ferrets, these pants will make six hours go by faster than anything. love them!  super comfortable!  have purchased many different colors and love them all. i love these pants. the pattern is awesome. the length of the legs were a little long but i just cut a little off the bottom. i\\'m 5\\'5. fit a little snug. very see through. but over all i love them. i ordered a size larger than i needed. still a touch snug. otherwise...absolutely great!!! wasn\\'t sure about size or material when i ordered but loved them as soon as i got them. material is soft and they fit well. i ordered 3 more the day i received my first pair. very comfortable and would highly recommend especially for the price! these are very flattering, lightweight polyester, but you can\\'t see through them, they wash well,<br />the colors are perfect to match with tops, they are much too long but you can just cut off what you don\\'t need, they are not hemmed, and it does not ravel or get threads hanging after you cut it, no one knows that there\\'s no hem on them.<br />i ordered small, i\\'m 5\\'2 and 103 pounds, and except for the length, a perfect size. everyone asks me where i got them. very comfortable.  fits perfectly for an aladdin halloween costume. perfect and sexy i do caretaking for apartment buildings and wanted something light, flexible and comfortable. this was everything i expected. first time i have ordered pants online that actually fit when i received them. awesome news was the company sent me a catalog also and the pants were much cheaper to order directly through them. i will be ordering many more pairs directly through them for sure :d only complaint i would have is they fade very fast but for everyday wear for cleaning or just going to the store they are great :d great as always they were for my mom and this is her brand and size when it comes to pants. i weigh about 145 and i am 5,6. i got a size medium and they fit great, looked awesome and very comfortable. many complements on these pants!  i am a tall curvy gal, so they are not super baggy, but they look cool with boots.  i replaced the elastic so the waist would fit better.  ordering more from this brand for sure! breezy and comfy pant. thank you they are perfect love these.  comfy wide waistband, soft breathable fabric that\\'s great for summers (or all year round in fl lol), side seam convenient pockets and the sizing is true.  going to buy more and in several colors. they could be a tad bit longer, but they worked out well, and they are warm. nice fit. good value for the $ just got my pants they are extremely soft and cozy but my waistline is between a 38-40 so i can\\'t really fold these much so it\\'s more just tie and fold down. i\\'m surprised for a plus size i kinda thought it would be much larger. overall they are still awesome will be great for me to lounge in. great for around the house amazing fit! i\\'m a thick girl and they fit like a charm! it a little to big around the waist and a little short height wise that because i\\'m i\\'m tiny but tall but the pant are comfy the pants look just like the picture and were just as describe, except the meeting ran a little small. they fit, but are a little more snug than comfortable. good material and length. perfect sizing. i wear a size 10 and ordered a medium. truly, it could not have fit better. i jog/run and wear them doing housework. they may be a little pricey, but way better than a cheaper sauna suit. i love these pj bottoms! they are cute and comfortable. i love hatley pajamas and these definitely meet expectations. they are a good quality cotton, fun to wear and super cute.<br /><br />definitely a rest purchase! i was very pleased with the color, design & material.the size was fitting me exactly and i loved the fact that it was very light.  it came exactly the way it was described, but the reason why i gave 4 stars is because there were stitching missing in some pleats. i had to sew those pleats, before wearing it as it was seen obviously, also. i did not want to return it, so i am keeping it. otherwise it was really good! good fit they fit really good, but the color was a little different than in the picture. i still like them a lot though. love them these are my third pair of shining shakti\\'s and i love these as much as the first two!  i look forward to my fourth pair! soooooo comfortable!!! i want ten pairs!!! im 5\\'5 and 180 and the mediums fit good, a little longer which i like and thin which i like a lot too.! would buy again for sure! run small. have to reorder. i\\'m a thick chick so when i order online i always get a size larger.  it\\'s a crap shoot. sometimes pants are too small, too short even too big, but these pants fit better than i could have ever imagined! and they were delivered days before the expected delivery date. love these pants. bought these for my daughter and she loves them! these are great. feel great. fit great.  pretty the pants are made of rayon fabric...and this is 100% true. i bought two for myself and  checked the pants for their quality as i also had the doubt whether the pants were made of good fabric or not. but after checking, i was highly satisfied. i like the fit and cut; however, the material is fairly sheer.  make sure you wear skin-toned underpants unless you want everyone to know today is zebra-print undies day. i just received my order. i got the burgundy and carribean xs! i loved it! i was hesitating if ill get the small size coz thats my size but reading the reviews here, i decided to just get the xs and it perfectly fits me! these pants were a hit! my guy said they are in his &#34;top 5&#34; of his favorites for me to wear. very fun to wear. comfy! perfect, exactly what i was expecting. these pants are great!  very comfortable, they fit great but, very thin and a little see through!! comfortable love them!! super comfy! i bought them as cosplay pants for a goku costume but the orange is a little too dark. really comfortable and fits well... better pleased i love the no seams on the outer leg. can\\'t beat the price. the material is too thin to wear outside the house, but they\\'re very comfy for sleeping and wearing around the house. they wash well. i love them! the look petty good on. they did have a very strong and strange oder when i opened the package if the size was better than these would be great. but they are one size fits most jr girls awesome pants.. , im 5\\'8 , slender, i got a small size and they fit perfectly giving it to my granddaughter she will love these. love love love this quirky jumper.  so many styles to play with. i received my order promptly, and the pants were as described.  however, when i tried them on, i realized that i made a mistake in sizing, and had to return them. i really like these yoga pants  they are soft, flexible and fit well,  not too tight,  not too loose - so you can move freely<br />without fear !  they are bright colors and the right length ( i\\'m petite ....) so they are a great deal on line . the pants wash and wear well.  i love the feel of the soft knit and are very confortable to wear.  a great bargin for the price. she likes them the fabric is somewhat thin (although not see-through) and clingy. if this concerns you, probably should get 1 size larger. i like them and they fit everywhere but in the butt because mine is huge, so they are tight in that area these are by far my favorite scrub pants. i do a lot of bending, squatting, lifting, and moving around while at work and these pants stay in place and stay comfortable all day. i love that they have both elastic and drawstring waist for the perfect custom fit.  the pockets are in exactly the right spots so i can fill them up without things falling out every time i bend or squat.  and the extra cinching ability at the bottom of each pant leg comes in handy to keep my pant legs in place on particularly active days. the colors are rich and have held up very well to regular laundering as well as providing a great match to many of my patterned scrub shirts. pants have a little stretch to them, which is good.  i got them in several colors.  highly recommend these pants. these are a nice compromise between shorts and slacks. very comfortable and easy to care for, if you don\\'t mind washing in cold water. however, if you\\'re under 5\\'6&#34;, as i am, you might find these a little long. also, i wish they had pockets. but overall i\\'m very satisfied. these are the most comfortable pants i have ever worn.  i found them in peach, army green, &amp; red.  if i would find other colors i would buy every color available. very nice,well made pants but i\\'m 5 feet 10 inches and weigh 143.the size small fits perfectly except the length is too short even if i wear flats. they fit good.  i\\'ve been looking for some yoga pants that keep their shape.  these do.<br />there is a firm control feeling yet soft and moveable.  i feel like they keep everything where<br />it\\'s suppose to stay. these are not your pink fat pants. i bought these for an upcoming trip to florida. i was nervous buying pants online, but they fit perfectly!! shipping was super fast!!! only con is i will need to have them hemmed, but being 5\\'1 i generally accept that anyway ;) so i\\'m super happy and will be ordering more in other colors and more from this seller!! they are perfect! i bought these for my wife. she likes them and says they are comfortable when she works out.  i love seeing her wear them! very comfortable. i love these a lot more than i thought i would! i was a little afraid they were going to look like bicycle shorts but they don\\'t at all. i ordered a medium and they fit perfect; i am a pant size 4us (my hips are 36&#34; and my waist 30&#34;). these shorts don\\'t fall or ride up and they\\'re not too short but short enough. the best part about these is the gold zipper. it looks cute with tucked-in tees. i mostly wear these with sheer tights and they still don\\'t slip. the fabric is stretchy and flattering without being too thin or fragile. they are so comfortable i sometimes just wear them around the house :p definitely recommend! i love these so much. it came super early and when i opened it i thought it would be too small for me considering it\\'s an asian size. though the size chart is accurate to what it says. i\\'m 5\\'2 and 109 lbs it\\'s perfect, i was a bit thick before so it could\\'ve been tight.. it\\'s perfect if you have a butt or not. comes in a small package and yep! i\\'m not a big fan of the belt since it looks cheap and looks like that thick tape that you take off of a paper strip..but i won\\'t complain, i\\'ll just use a different belt. the sewing it great. in the back there\\'s elastic so it stretches, not all around though, it\\'s perf! recommend you buy these shorts. i\\'m definitely going to be buying the other colors too. (i got the black one) cheap price for great shorts very comfortable... the pants run a little small. i am very impressed with he quality and fit of these pants. they are very nicely cut, and fit well. the waist is high enough, not to cut you off in the middle and it does not show off your behind when you bend over. the pant length is perfect too. they are also not too tight, and do not show off your imperfections like other tights can. i would highly recumbent these to anyone! i received this product for review and inspection purposes and my honest and unbiased review. i must admit that i was scared i would get bad colors and awful patterns.  you can\\'t pick what you would prefer when ordering.  i bought the 5 pack anyway, given the other great reviews, and i just decided that if the other customers loved theirs, i would love mine ~ they were right!  my selection also had gorgeous, bright colors and patterns, on both sides.  it\\'s like having 10 pairs of silky bohemian, exotic pants.  perfect for spring, summer, and autumn.  definitely a great buy, at such a good price!! i actually bought this for my sister and she loves it.  the only problem will be getting her to wear it.  she seems to feel that this style is different than the norm in south carolina.  i told her to be a trail blazer! still giving five stars for these being great pants... the only problem is they are pretty sheer. i have to wear bike shorts underneath. love the pants but they run big.. going to order a smaller size. so comfortable!!!!! this is so cute! looks just like the pic and fits great, i am 5\\'5&#34; & 120 lbs. and the size small fits perfectly. i am super happy with this purchase! love these pajamas! super comfortable and lightweight enough not to get too warm. quick shipping too! love love love them!!! they fit perfectly o  me and i\\'m a size 14 or so. the pants are not see through like some previous reviews stated and they are just a tad darker than the pictures online. i had to send these back because i hadn\\'t noticed they were &#34;plus size.&#34;  i could fit one of me in each leg, and have a picnic in the seat area.  but they really are great quality pants, and aside from being huge, look really cool and comfy and were easy to tie. i love these bermuda style stretch pants.  well made and super comfortable. absolutely divine..!! fits true to size and wears so comfortably. comfy--colorful and did i say comfy!! :-) these swim shorts are very good quality!  my only complaint is that the size &#34;small&#34; is a little too snug, and, although i am petite and in pretty good shape (5\\'0 tall - 105lbs), love handles seem to make an appearance when i put them on.  i still wear them, and i plan on buying another pair, but, this time, i\\'ll get the medium size. i love these palazzo\\'s!!<br />the feel & look great!! the solid color is wonderful for coordinating with current tops in my closet. these pants are made just right for someone who has a nice figure. the feel of the material is silky, and they are very unique. i bought these for my sister, and she loves them. she has everything, but i knew these would be a show stopper! great product love these very comfortable! great quality ski pants and well cut.  it had many useful pockets and technical details.    i ordered a size too big because of the size restrictions so they didn\\'t fit me.  i sold it to a friend and it fit her well.  order only if your size is available! this is a great bra for the \\\\\\\\\"less-endowed\\\\\\\\\"woman.  the wacoal bralette is light, while providing adequate support  and coverage for smaller women.  there are no hooks in the back, which is a bonus for those of us who find the back hardware uncomfortable  when seated against a wooden chair back or in some other uncomfortable seat.  the fabric breathes, wears and washes well.  this bralette is pretty, comfortable and practical and will last a few years with proper care.  i highly recommend this wacoal bralette! i\\'m a 5\\' 10&#34; tall woman and it can be really challenging to find pants that are long enough (especially cute, comfy pants like these). these are definitely long enough and they are surprisingly cool. i took them to se asia and was rarely hot at all in them, despite the hot and humid summer temperatures. these leggings are cute and classy! they fit great and are very comfortable. i would highly recommend to a friend. i love them.  i ordered size small.  i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; tall, 128 pounds.  i\\'m curvy in the hips but have a narrow waist (26&#34;).  pants tend to pool on the floor because i\\'m short, but these were the perfect length for me.  i only wore them for ten minutes before i went back online and ordered two more pairs in different colors.  the material is thin, but not see-through thin (unless you are wearing the lighter ones with really dark underwear) but they can show panty lines.  i cured this buy wearing underwear designed to reduce panty lines (not a thong, but a bikini cut).  that worked just fine. i bought these for my granddaughter. as any teen, she is not easy to please but she loves the pants and now lives in them.they fit well and are comfortable. i\\'m so glad i bought two pair one with grey top and one with white top. very comfortable great fabric, great pants. love these as &#34;hacking about the house&#34; pants! they are sized accurately and are the second pair i have purchased! i really like these.  very lightweight and figure flattering (much needed here).  will be ordering more. really cute. i am 5&#34;5 about 130lbs. i bought a medium. based on my jean sizes of 4 to 6. these defiantly were good quality but are a little big in the waist an got losser the longer i worn them. great item these are alittle sheerer than i expected. loved these pants.  i accidently ordered two pair but will keep them both as i already know i will wear them as often as possible. i\\'m 5\\'1&#34; and the wasteband comes up to practicly my bra line.  but i still like the fit and the look. the fabric is havy enough and looks very nice. cute very comfortable and fit well.  the material is a nice weight and feel. the product was just as described and is an excellent selection for anyone that needs to project a professional appearance, but still wants to be comfortable. i have worn the donnkenny brand for several years when jc penney carried them. they wash and wear very well. i actually ordered the wrong size on this order and returned it to the seller. i received a prompt refund just as promised. all in all, a great transaction with a great product and seller. love it love these pants!  very comfy.  great deal for the price! have not had much success in the past buying pants on line.  these were a nice surprise and i will buy more from this seller. just gorgeous and comfortable.  gives you slim long legs even when pregnant!  ended up buying 3 pairs in different colors. while i have yet to wear them, they feel good.  the elastic at the waist seems a little tight but that is probably because i am too thick for it. great material! maybe it\\'s just me but pants gave me a little camel toe going on and was easily fixed. very slimming and not as high waisted as you would think. great buy! they were too small had to send them back awesome item ! love them !!!!! they fit perfectly and they are very stretchy . they are beautiful. my daughter you loved large waistband and well fitted. this arrived on time and in very good condition. this boho pants is really nice and comfy, i use it as lounge wear. it fits to me really well but because i am petite it is a little long for me. the waist is a little stretchable and it is very well hemmed. the fabric used is comfortable, soft  and strong.<br />this is really airy ,great for summer and spring. i bought one in black color so it is easy to wash, as the basic do not bleach. it says hand wash cold but i already washed it in the washing machine and still good. however the end of this pants is not stitched or hemmed, so if this matters you might want to think about it. but this is really comfy lounge pants and i really like how soft it is and not irritating on the skin. i am satisfied with this buy. i bought it with a promotional discount in exchange for my honest review, regardless this pants is really worth the money for me! they fit well just really see thru love it good product. thanks! it was just what i wanted great pants koi is the best and most comfortable out there! love them... they are so incredibly cute!!!  color is exactly as pictured, i\\'m 5\\' 2&#34; 105lbs and they fit just the way i want them not too tight but not too loose... just perfect!!! love these! very comfortable and look great as casual wear or dressed up a bit for work. long and comfortable but sheer - so i use them only at home and when i\\'m sleeping. perfect my daughter loves them. perfect! the fit me good. great! i\\'m addicted to pj and lounge pants and hatley is the best of the lot. so soft and so comfy. size is great and they wash well in cold - they get softer with every wash. cute pattern of owls makes me smile and i wish i could wear them to work. the top is a wrap. you wrap it to fit the way that you want it too. very cute outfit ! these pants are too cute and very comfortable! i just wished i ordered a medium instead of a large. fits well i love these! people look at me strange cuz they r different but i dont care!<br />i dont use the overall part up i keep it down cuz then u have pockets. the ones they show in the photos r not true pockets. they will only fit ur hands. my leggings just arrived today and i was excited to see how they fit. happy to say they fit great and are not as see through as i had expected. (i\\'m 5\\'5 137#). they seem to have a little stretch in them which was a nice surprise. so far i\\'d give them two thumbs up. normally i wear a small, but i had to get these in a medium. the butt in these is very small. so if you have a big booty make sure you get a size up. very warm and stay dry. good fit sooo comfortable!  i get tons of compliments.  i\\'m 5.7 140 and where an xl in their sizes - hope that helps. the hoodie too small for me , the pants  longs awsome pants...<br />my girlfriend\\'s ass looks amazing :)<br />i will definitely buy more<br /><br />she does not let me take some pictures but it looks huge ^.^ i got this on xl because i was afraid it might not fit me in the belly area but it fit well there but just a little large on my legs. the fabric is great and it looks very nice put on. i\\'m 5ft 3 inches and need to lose a few pounds. i ordered a large black. i will have to take the hem up slightly but that is okay, the legs are really wide, and the pants are very comfortable. i love them. just ordered a red.<br /><br />i wouldn\\'t wear them for gardening since the legs might catch in machinery or make me trip but otherwise perfect. will probably order several colors. i had yoga pants from wal-mart that fit really well, size large. i bought these in a large as well and they are tighter than the wal-mart ones. i did find they were a bit sheer when stretched around \\\\\\\\\"thunder thighs\\\\\\\\\". i am 5\\'6\\'\\' and about 150lbs. great length and i am sure a better fit when i lose a few pounds :) these palazzo pants are great. it is so hard to get this sort of pant on amazon because of inaccurate sizing descriptions.  but these are perfect.  i am 5 foot 8, a size 14, and not a small 14, a real 14.  the x-large of these pants fits perfectly.  not too tight, not too long.  however, if you are a size 16 or above, i think the x-large would be too tight.  the material is thin, so be aware of that, but not see-through, and not cheap.  pretty nicely made.  i really love them. fit perfect! decent quality pant that i will wear to work out in. fits well and i don\\'t need to get them shortened (i\\'m 5\\'5). granddaughter loved the material and of course the print is her favorite.  they are a bit roomy for a small but she still loved them these wrap pants are exceedingly comfortable, very good quality, and come in lots of colors. in addition, this seller responded quickly regarding an error, getting needed product to me in just over a day, averting disaster in a time crunch. bravo ! love it package arrived way ahead of schedule and fit me perfect. super cute!! i am 100 lb and 5\\'2. i might buy in the other colors, depending on how well these hold up in the wash. very comfy. i was worried that they may be too small, since large was the biggest size, but they fit nicely. i\\'m 5\\'8&#34; and very curvy and wear a 12-14. even at 5\\'8&#34; they are extremely long, i wear with 2&#34; sandals and they still drag, if i wore with my 5&#34; heels they would be fine, but that wasn\\'t my purpose, wanted something to wear in flats. but i knew they would be based on other reviews, decided to try them anyway. happy with purchase overall. for the price this is a great product. it is a little thin for my taste and if you have a big butt like me that might make you a bit uncomfortable. but is overall what you would expect and i\\'ve used it under big shalls/poncho style shirts and it looks great. i also used them for gardening since they are so comfortable. they can be pjs, or depending on accessories, i\\'ve used them to work as well. honestly, we are pregnant, we can get away with anything! hey yall! greetings from the peach state! i ordered these pants in navy on saturday afternoon with free standard shipping & they arrived today (tuesday) before lunch! what a wonderful company! so far i love these pants the fit, cut, & fabric are awesome. they are a bit short but the seller did disclose the inseam length in the details & i\\'m a sorta tall lady i guess. i\\'m 5\\'9&#34; with a 35&#34; inseam short waisted with extra long legs & arms. i wear a tall women\\'s medium or size 8 tall & these i ordered in a size 8 tall & it was dead on except for the length. but my legs are longer than most others even those my height. i live in south georgia which means heat +  humidity= hot sticky sweaty misery. i have not worn these babies long but they are comfy, cool, & softer than my pjs! i\\'ll update y\\'all after i wash & wear them in a few days. but so far they are wonderful i do think the inseam was 33&#34; & i will try one of my lengthening tricks & let you long-legged ladies know if it works! they look so good on even my ugly fat figure. i needed something i could wear around my house to lounge in when i am in pain but we\\'re versatile enough to dress up for a cookout or a casual supper out. and comfortable enough not to cause my cronic ab pain to flare up these pants fit the bill. they are like that perfect little black dress but in pants form i am so happy i found them plus they are made in the usa!!!! (which makes me feel better about buying them as usually our products are more durable, & safe as far as chemical dyes & what not. they run a little small i\\'m 5\\'3 and 130 lbs.  i usually wear a size 4/6 depending on the cut. the xl in these pants fits perfectly.<br />purchased them for a hiking trip that\\'s coming up.  given all the reviews on here i decided to purchase a couple sizes larger and found that these fit as i expected them to. not bad otherwise. great highwaisted? but other than that very comfortable. somewhat see through, but very light summery look, sexyh casual perfect fit! i did the measurements because i was buying this for my girlfriend and everything was great. i was a little worried about the length, but it was a perfect length (she\\'s 5\\'7&#34;). they\\'re very comfortable and not see through either. so comfortable. fits perfect. these were nicely-made, for a very reasonable price. they were fitted, with a waistband. other silk trousers that i found were much less well-made. therefore, i\\'d recommend these even though i ended up sending them back (just because i decided to buy a slacks in a completely different material). very comfortable and true to size fit i normally wear women size 4-6. for jeans and size m for sport pants.  got size m for this pants. size feel true. material is elastic enough, but runs a little thin compared to my other sport pants from nike or nb. but hey, it is not a fair comparison for the bucks you spent. fit nicely through hip to thigh, no pantie lines shown. fold down neon contrast band add great color. i love this pants!  i bought a small in light green and coral, both great!  i purchased a 2nd pair and thinking of going for a 3rd.  i\\'m 5\\'8 and they are really long (good in my case) and a bit big in the waist (130 lbs) but i\\'m completely ok with that. so comfy, so cute. better than expected. they fit pretty well. i have large legs and they fit them. but they do sort of camel toe in front. for me that\\'s not an issue because i have a shirt that covers it. otherwise they are really cute. very nice jumpsuit! can be played upnor down with the right accesories and shoes. good quality material. love them ... i wear a 4 but ordered a 5 because others say they fit small .... if they stretch too much will order the smaller size....received lots of compliments on these. good jean leggings,great these palazzo pants come in a wide range of colors and prints which are very stylish. i ordered the crested black white. it’s made with 95% polyester and 5% spandex. the material is silky soft and is very comfortable. the top of the pants have a 6” wide band. there is no elastic so it’s very comfortable around your waist. you can wear it scrunched, folded over or simply straight.<br /><br />measurements of xl<br /><br />waist: 15.25” wide<br /><br />hips: 19.5” wide<br /><br />inseam: 32.5”<br /><br />thigh: 12.5” wide<br /><br />leg opening: 13.25” wide<br /><br />these are approximate measurements while lying flat. they have a good amount of stretch to them so they do expand a bit. since you can fold over the top of the pants, you can adjust the length some.  you can wear these palazzo pants with almost any style top and can be casual wear or dressed up. my only issue with these pants are they are slightly see through. i wish the material was a bit thicker. if you wear a longer top, which i usually do, you will be fine. other than that, these are great pants. they are very fashionable and super comfortable. these are lightweight so they are perfect for summer. i received this complimentary product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. prompt delivery.  i would recommend highly. looks great, made well, the fabric is a bit sheer, though it is nice fabric. me encanto! nice jumper good like a lot. fits great. i am 5\\'6&#34; and 145 lbs ordered a medium but i have to hem. a little too long but i really like lovely dressy fabric. however, the fit was clingy. excellent product - fits well and looks good. italian best material and design yaaaaaaaaaaas!! these pants are on point love these pants.  super soft and comfortable.  and--bonus--they wrinkle very little... even after being wadded up in a suitcase.  no shrinkage in the wash (warm), or dryer (low).  i may purchase another pair, if another color is available! super comfy! 👍 they are awesome an amazing !! & for dancing they are great !!!! jockey scrubs are the comfiest scrubs i have owned. i love them. i\\'m a 120 pounds and can fit xs or s comfortably. this pant is very cute and confortable , the color is the same like a picture and is very cheap. i will start by saying these are my new favorite weekend pants.  i love them.  i absolutely love them.  now, that being said, i took the sizing recommendations seriously and ordered a size 10.  i am 5\\'1&#34; and usually order a 6 or an 8.  the size 10 fits really well.  what is also nice is that there is a drawstring in the bottom hem so that i can tie the bottoms as loosely or as tightly as i want so i don\\'t step on the pants, as they are a little long.  the waist fit and rear end fit is perfect.  i can even tuck a cami or tank into the pants with no problem.  they are a great material, sturdy, yet comfortable.  they can be dressed up (like all the cute pictures on pintrest!!) or casually worn.  lots of pockets if you like that.  i love them.  order up a size or two and you won\\'t be disappointed. i love these pants. great fit!! you can dress them  up or down. i\\'m ordering all the colors. great for spring love these pants worth every penny i paid...gave it as a present so not sure of quality other that what i saw when it arrived very cute and fun for the summer or  for yoga. i like these scrub pants- they fit well. i had been warned to buy a size larger than usual for other brands.  the color is deep and does not bleed in the wash.  the pants don\\'t wrinkle if you get them out of the dryer promptly very light and airy. great for working out or loungers on a hot summer day. the pant ist too large without a drawstring tie at the waist and a smaller size woud be too small for pajamas.  i put in a drawstring to fit better.<br />otherwise they are not too heavy and real cute and comfy. i like these a lot. i am curvy and the medium fit well, although i would have preferred a large. after wearing them and washing the a few times, the stretch fibers are breaking apart and showing. they look like tiny white hairs coming out of the seams. but, they\\'re very slimming and look great on. just wish they were available in a bigger size. love these, just wish back pockets had wider velcro to stop the corner from flipping up, and have to get tall, regular is too short. i am only 5\\' 5 the product is of high quality and fits excellent. the fabric is thicker than most other silk long- underwear. it is soft, warm and a comfortable fit. the waist is stretchy and fits nicely. you can\\'t feel the waist band.  i bought a different brand to compare to and i would buy another pair of these. i went snowshoeing - 25 degrees and i sweated lots but  these kept me warm and dry. worth the money! be good to yourself and invest in a pair. needs belt loops all around, not just in the front. i have a hard time keeping the pants up if i have something in the pockets. i had wanted them looser for bending/moving around on the job, but this is the result. these pants are fun and comfortable and i my husband likes them on me.  the seller got this product to me on time and in excellent condition. i would definitely buy from this seller again. great leggings! the material is awesome; the only thing is they\\'re see- through. other than that they\\'re incredibly comfortable!! def recommend; thinking about getting another pair.....just for lounging. the harem pants is very comfortable and soft to the skin. love it\\'s texture. fits well. planning to order more in different colors. great cheap leggings works like it shud moves so well with me and is very comfy. these shorts are great!! the shipping took way less time than it said. i was expecting it to come 2 months later, but it arrived after only 2 weeks! the only thing i don\\'t like about these shorts is that the color looks slightly more faded than it shows. however, i definitely don\\'t regret my purchase. these shorts are a must! soft, comfy, perfect for work or hanging out around home/casual going out. love the pockets! as soon as i can i\\'m ordering another pair. good deal exceeded my expectations i never thought pull-on pants could look/fit this good.  color me shocked and happy. theyre short even hanging low, but i love them anyway. see how they hang over the guy\\'s feet in the picture? he must be 4\\'6&#34; :) i love the pants, fits a lil more snug than i like. i ordered a large but i\\'m afraid the x-large will be too baggy. i am going to keep them since everyone tells me how cute the are! my whole family received hatley pajama bottoms for christmas. they are so well made and comfortable. i will be getting more soon. work great really happy with this set. hoodie and pants fit comfortably. can\\'t wait to wear it traveling to florida this winter. loved them i love this line of pants. i bought them for the gym but they are so comfortable i decided to keep them for every day use. it´s a beauty pant, but some small great suit at a great price excellent!!! they are too warm for summer time wear,  so i just tried them on,  but they really are soft and comfy. seem just a tad small compared to other sleep pants of the same size,  so if you\\'re between sizes,  you might want to order the larger size. 100% recomended wonderfully soft, but could stand a draw-string. i wear these for sleeping, and they do not bunch or wad up.  very comfortable.  wash well.  love them. i really love this item. i expected it to be a bit more snug on me as i am a larger gal. i wanted this anyway as i am losing weight and figured it would look nice now and nicer as i slim down.  a good transitional piece of clothing and not expensive. if you purchase from this company be warned. there is a reason the prices are great. these items are unique but not high quality. so, avoid the dryer and expect some issues with seams opening in the future. (it\\'s easy to fix) also, the buttons down the front are not functional except the top one. the suspenders detach from the front by a button. my button holes were a bit too small so it was a struggle at first. like i said before great item but you get what you pay for and there is a definite sacrifice of quality for price. i love them i altered the pants legs.. super cute and comfy.  not see-through like other leggings i wasn\\'t sure what this was going to be like because the photo is rather blurry but they are actually really cute and great quality. light weight denim, looks like a skirt until you walk. i love these pants, but found unless i ordered tall they would become too short too quickly.  i am almost 5\\'7\\\\\\\\\", and the regular pants fit for a few washings, but then would become floods.  i love this brand, as they are comfortable, and durable. these have been a very good purchase.  i needed something very loose and baggy and these are bigger then i wear so are just the ticket. love nydj, love faux suede great for the price, these are great pants. i got them for yoga, and they are incredibly confortable and well made.they are made by a small family company  (i like to support a grass roots business ) from thailand...just be prepared, the mail service from that country is quite slow. love, love, love!  got four colors and they are fantastic.  i disagree with other reviews about the fabric being cheap or low quality.  they are great.  i got in charcoal, mocha, burgundy and black.  i have no problem with panty lines or fabric being too sheer, even with the mocha color which is a tanish color.  i am 5\\'4&#34;, 135# and the small fits just right.  slightly long for my height but no matter b/c with just a little lift from shoes they\\'ll be perfect.  do yourself a favor and get some, this price can\\'t be beat.  i certainly will be getting more. wish they had something under them but i love them very thin. very good buy, just as depicted in photo, a nice smooth material, money well spent. endorse for purchasing. exactly as on the photo. fits great. price and quality are met! they are perfect. exactly what i was looking for. im only 5\\' so they come up a little high on the waist but its not uncomfortable. i love them. i need to get my girlfriend a pair of those yoga pants everybody was talking about. when i found out that these became see through when she would bend over i bought 10 pairs! best purchase ever! very nice! awesome and tight i wish they came in more than one color! i\\'m wearing the skort as i write this review... amazing line... soft, comfortable, and wash up great! pants that can be cut with scissors to your exact length? genious! these pants are comfortable and i love the material. thanxxxxxxxx love!!!!! recommend sizing up. i weigh hundred and 15 and i\\'m five foot  two  fit perfect cute! fast shipping these are fantastic leggings.  i was just looking for a cheap pair of leggings for a costume and thought these looked like a good deal.  after trying them on, feeling the fabric and seeing how great they look i\\'m going to be getting them in every color.  i\\'m 5\\'5&#34;, normally a size 4/6 and the one size fits all fits spectacularly well.  not too tight, not too big. i was able to slip right into them without any areas being uncomfortable or &#34;bulgy&#34; and they went all the way to my ankle and up to the top of my hip (like normal rise jeans), but there was enough give that i could have pulled them up a little higher if i desired.  great product, great price! good fit, not tight.  ordered small for a 5\\'7&#34; 119# woman.  nice material, washes well.  pockets are great.  waistband comfortable. i love them, so comfortable!! i have 2 now and i would buy one in every color!! i ordered one pair of these, and after washing and wearing them a few times, am now ordering some more! i am neither fat nor slim, but really kind of average and these fit great! not too tight, but just comfortably loose so that you can move and bend over easily. they sit just below the waist, so they would look good on anyone, young or older. the quality is excellent. they shrank slightly when washed, preventing the need to hem or otherwise tailor them. the flannel lining is soft and warm. these jeans are fairly heavy weight and will protect you against colder temperatures. great value! perfect fit, beautiful color and material, exactly as described! i love my pants, yes, i do recommend this item!! i only buy jockey scrubs.  they have enough spandex in them to make them stretchy and so comfortable.  feels like wearing my yoga pants to work! love these pants, they fit great and very comfortable! pretty nice leggings. i ordered the small/medium and they are a little tight, but not bad (i\\'m a tad less than 110 lbs, and about 5\\'3&#34; if that helps) i did however like the length of these. they don\\'t rise up into awkward knee length while walking and that\\'s what i really wanted. fit is a little tight. large is actually a medium. these pants are not only extremely cute and comfortable, they are easy to care for as well.  they have been my go-to pants all summer!  have recieved many compliments and inquiries on these awesome pants.  the only thing that i thought was odd is there is only one pocket and on the right side - as a lefty, i have learned to adapt.  the pocket easily carries a cell phone, or a set of keys without feeling bulky. nice and light for summer. the bottoms ride up, but it doesn\\'t bother me. perfect. very comfortable pants! material is a little bit thin , but i still love them! i\\'m about a size 5 and i ordered a small. they fit just like i thought they would! very happy with my purchase! girlfriend likes to wear them .and thats what counts i think the term wide leg doesn\\'t do these leggings justice. not only do they feel nice and loose in the legs, but they fit just right in the waist. the leggings are everything you can hope for and more.  you will not be disappointed. something about the color called too me , thin enough to wear under other clothes but also fantastic as sunday relax and watch a good movie day clothing it was excellent! lil bit tight love this romper... great! it\\'s very stretchy and comfy! looks great too! the top was a little too tight ( i am 36c) and the pants were a little too loose... gave these to my wife as a gift. she loves them. i imitate the bears on them and chase her around. very mature and invigorating. really comfortable. the color matches with everything. really happy that i got to buy this product at this price. i love these pants! they are flattering and very comfortable. i got them in white, because that is the color that is requred for my job...i would not buy white by choice...the problem with the white is that they are really see through. if you are going to make white pants, make the fabric thicker. i have never understood this. the pants flow nicely love baggy look. i got these for my mom.  i couldn\\'t order the black because they were out, so i ordered cranberry.  they\\'re loud but color wasn\\'t as important as comfort so she still likes them for around the house.  she says the weight is nice and they\\'re really comfortable. nice very comfortable and can be worn all year round i live in hatley pajama pants - i work from home and have pets and livestock so i need comfortable clothing i can move in and that i can get covered in dirt and hair (and slobber, sigh) and just toss in the wash whenever. hatley pants are made well and have comfortable fabrics -- i use them as &#34;scrubs&#34; but they\\'re a lot more comfortable. great for lounging in on movie night. the only danger is that they\\'re as comfortable for lounging as they are for moving, so if you gain weight you might not notice until the day you have to get into your jeans or slacks. this pattern is one of my favorites because chocolate labradors are my favorite type of dog. it usually takes me 3 years to wear out a pair of hatleys and i use them *hard* -- i\\'ve even ridden my horses in them, spontaneously --  so i am pretty sure if you have a pair just for normal pajama and lounge use they\\'ll last you a lot longer. love i know they are listed as capris, but i call them shorts, because they hit my knees but they don\\'t extend below them.  i chose size 11/12 when i normally wear size 10.  they were a little large, but they shrunk in the wash.  now, they look too small, but the fabric is stretchy and it fits perfectly.<br /><br />i\\'ve gotten lots of compliments on these shorts, even as the colors faded in the wash.  my husband said he liked them, and he doesn\\'t often comment on my clothes.  the shorts have a very low waist, which means i have to wear long shirts to make sure parts of my rear don\\'t peek through.<br /><br />this product was provided for review by oriondeals. too small. i am normally xl in all pants if not l. these run very small. i have larger thighs, am 200 lbs 5\\'6. all other joggers i have ordered in an xl have fit. the legs are quite skinny. they look great. i wish they mad 1x, i would re order. fits perfectly fine love them disappointed that the color was not as bright hunter green as expected!! i use these for circus and aerial and they are great. i get lots of compliments on them and they have held up really well to wear-and-tear. no problems.<br /><br />note, the stripes are thinner than on the picture (prob about .5 inches vs the 1- 1.5 inch stripes in the photo). they are not super stretchy, which is excellent because they have lasted me a long time now, but could be a problem for voluptuous thighs. love them! perfect super comfy!! would highly recommend! cute pants.  hoped they would fit a bit better but will look great with a long shirt. good very comfortable and may order more for the gym and around the house. they are lightweight which i like better than the thick sweatshirt kind. super stretchy leggings, nice & thick fabric! love them! definitely getting all colors! :) i have to dress up for work and i hate it.  these are fabulous.  i was buying slacks for around $70 but these pants are half that and are more comfortable.  mind you they are not as fancy as actual office slacks, but they pass and i feel like i\\'m wearing yoga pants to work.  i have just ordered two more pair!  compare woman within website with amazon when purchasing as the are different prices depending on sales.  make sure you order by the size chart, they run small.  i needed a two sizes bigger than if i had bought them in a store. i actually ordered these as they were the only &#34;pair&#34; with pockets.  although i would have preferred a thinner, more drapey fabric, i knew the unisex style would not be exactly feminine--and it isn\\'t.  but:  it\\'s practical.  i live in the desert and appreciate the 100 percent cotton.  with a wash or two they will probably soften up.  i am 5\\'6&#34; and wear a size 8-12, depending upon the style, and these are definitely generously sized.  a bit much fabric for my taste, but again, we\\'ll see how much these soften up after some washings.  they are very well made, beautifully packaged, arrived earlier than expected.<br /><br />i would love to have them in white, off white, or a pale blue or any pastel--and imagine how wonderful they would be in a thin linen.  who knows, maybe they manufacturer will expand the line.  just keep the pockets please. i wear a size 4 pants and the medium was just barely a little snug, probably more my comfort level than the actual size.  beautiful material. looove these cargo pants. another reviewer says it runs small so i ordered a medium 6, although i am a size 0 possibly 2. just a tad bit tight around thigh area and the waist area does require a belt, kinda awkward measurements. the length is perfect, the material is of good quality, nice pockets!! i love the light blue color. i will definitely buy all colors. great buy . thanks these pants are sweet!  i\\'ve traveled the world and bought lots of fun baggy pants in the past.  the problem with most of thai style pants with the beautiful prints are made of super thin material that rips very fast.  these pants and thin as well but responsibly made, so that they don\\'t tear every time you bend over. ie. they are totally fine for yoga and such.  i wouldn\\'t wear them in really cold conditions, but for the 60-80f range these guys are perfect! love it!!!! very comfortable. very warm. perfect length. i\\'m 5\\'9. they are my favorite lounge pants would definitely recommend for wonder woman fans i  was skeptical at first but they fit as expected and comfortable. really love the comfy fit!!! i love these leggings! i ordered an xl but i didn\\'t think i would be able to wear them wearing a size 16, they fit perfectly!!! didn\\'t have to wait until i lost weight after all. i love \\'em! they\\'re the most comfortable pants i own. i bought 2 pair. the fit is very flattering. when you have a thick waistline and slim hips, pants can be impossible to find! i\\'m so happy that you don\\'t have to sacrifice style, in order to be comfortable. i hope they get them in more colors. i would love these pants in olive green and or khaki (hint, hint). fits and wears well these pants are super soft and exactly what i was looking for to complete a pirate costume. however, they are not &#34;plus size&#34; but rather the tag says &#34;one size&#34; which is fine, they stretch a lot. i wear a size 20 and they are fine on me. i\\'m 5\\'7 and the crotch is at my ankles, in order to get them to look like they are in the picture i have to wear the waist urkel style. great these are the greatest workout pants i own.  i am tall and these pants are the perfect length.  i have never had a fit as nice as these even in other more pricey brands.  also i have washed them several times and they still look and fit great.  you have to get these pants! these pants are fabulous! they are a lot brighter than the picture- which i love. very soft and beautiful! they are slightly see through, they are white after all, but not too bad- definitely not as see through as some others that are black. they arrived quickly and in great condition. i loved it, it looks cheap a bit but very cute. it\\'s also fashion and good for summer with white blouse i ballroom dance competitively and wear leggings in the winter under my skirts. these are comfortable and awesome looking. really fast delivery i really want to give these more stars.  but they are too short.  i will have to take them to a seamstress and have them lengthened.  i love the style, though!  i am 5\\'6&#34;, 195 pounds and a size 16-18.  these fit comfortably in all respects except the length.  the first asian factory to start producing fashion that really truly fits europeans are going to break out of the ever more competitive manufacturing pack.<br /><br />i wouldn\\'t buy these again because of the length problem (if you are 5\\' 3&#34; or less, this won\\'t be an issue).  if they fix that, i\\'ll definitely buy more. these are great for being out in the cold. i did read the reviews on the guide gear site and saw that a reviewer said that they ran too small. i ordered an xl when i should have ordered a l. i am 5\\'4&#34; 135lbs. the xl is an inch too long in the length. i needed them for work asap so i wore the xl and they keep me warm while working outside for 7 hours in 29 degree weather. i just rolled up the cuffs once and they were fine. i will be ordering a l here soon to see how it fits. overall .... they are well made and keep the cold out and are nice looking cargo snow pants. it fit as expected and it looked exactly like it did in the picture. i love it these pants are so comfortable, it\\'s almost too comfortable… i ordered these in every other color available. the cell foam pocket makes these an absolute must have. i think these are awesome. so big and comfy and unusual. i plan to wear when driving across the mojave this summer. also, great around the house! hubby just said: &#34;those are some mighty unusual pants you got there.&#34; i said: &#34;do you like them?&#34; he said: &#34;those are some might unusual pants you got there.&#34; i left it at that and considered it a complement. at least he noticed (married 24 years). he\\'s used to my eccentricities. btw, these do look a bit eccentric in south texas. oh well, who cares? i love \\'em. cool, cotton, and come in a cute matching drawstring bag. have not washed them yet, hope they don\\'t shrink too much. i like them big and baggy :) btw, size 16 reg. and getting smaller every day -- these will fit no matter what. you could pull a drawstring through and replace elastic, i think. there\\'s also another kind that has a more flattering front, but i don\\'t think they are 100% cotton. love the extra pockets, navy color holds true through washes, fit is very flattering. had a pt with bed bugs, was really glad i could close the ankles with the elastic draw cords!! great fit. fabric a little thin.<br />makes you look thin! billowy, light but not see through, easy to care for and fun to wear (even on days when you just want to lay around, hang out) i was very pleased. they arrived in no time (love my prime account). love this pant! and also i can use this like a pantsuit and a cardigan at the top! it looks great and the cloth so perfect for summer thank you! got these in purple, great shade. a little tight. might just take some getting used to since it\\'s my first pair of jeggings. i love it very comfy! i bought these for my wife and she was shocked when she put them on and they weren\\'t too short - it seems to be the norm for pj pants to sit above the ankle.  she loves them, which means i\\'m happy. very good i love these shorts and very pleased with the quality. one thing is that i\\'m disappointed with is that i never received the second pair of shorts from the seller. other than that, the shorts are super cute and fit great. i\\'m digging these pants alot! i really like that the button is good quality and sturdy. the material hugs my body just right without being too tight. they\\'re comfortable and i am very impressed with these. this was really cute, and fit well. the downside is tht i have a long torso so it tried to ride up. the fabric was a little thin, but super soft. the pants fit great, and didn\\'t really shrink that much after washing them.  they came in a very timely manner, was perfect for my zebra halloween costume! comfy, look like the picture; arrived on time. would make daisy. duke blush, perfect i absolutely love these pants.  they fit so well and are very comfy.  the girls at work complimented them and that\\'s when you know that you not only feel good, but look good too.  i wish there were more colors because i would buy them all!  if you are between sizes, buy the size down as these have spandex and are not tight! i got these today and it fit wonderful...am 5.2 in height,  150 in weight, 41 hips ,34 waist . i bought 2 , the gray and the black, but the black is a more better material just bcuz it seems  to have more stretch to me. i would buy more of these.. soooo comfortable and soft! love them! i\\'m short so i ordered petite<br />my second pair and i will buy more! comfy yoga pants. i am 5\\'9&#34; 159 and ordered a medium - pants are perfect length and fit well overall. if i could change one thing- i would request them to be thicker...they are pretty thin and sheer. my husband told me not to wear them outside the house and i replied, \\'don\\'t plan to!\\' :) the idea of the mystery bundle is so cool! i love the idea of receiving items i normally wouldn\\'t recognize as &#34;my style&#34; in the store. it explands your wardrobe and opens your mind to new looks that you can incoporate into your current style. i loved the items i received. they all fit well and were super cute pieces! this is a killer deal for how many items you receive as well. gooo for it guys! i was well pleased. :) great pants for traveling. i like the wide leg look, and the waist band is very comfortable. expected more very colorful. washes well. worn with a tank top. slightly see-through so don\\'t wear any crazy underwear. best saturday outfit! i ordered 3 pairs of these leggings and i love them. they are super warm, and i wear them all the time. i\\'m around 5\\'7&#34;, so i\\'ve never expected leggings to be long enough, but these were actually longer than i expected, hitting right above my ankle.<br /><br />when i ordered them, they accidentally sent me two of the same print. when i emailed them about the issue, they emailed me back right away stating that they would send the correct ones the next business day, and that the ones they sent by mistake are a gift. they are so kind and it\\'s an all around great product. i will definitely recommend them to people. love the feel of these pants....very soft and comfortable material....only downfall is that they are slightly see through but if you wear a longer shirt no one can tell. the fit was better than expected. i got xs just my size. great buy! i chose &#34;medium&#34; from the drop down menu. this is a us size medium (size 8-10) / 2xl size for china. i contacted the seller for a size confirmation. the pants are great. they look great and the material feels durable but comfortable. will be giving them a work out in a few weeks so i will post an update. love the suspenders. despite shipping all the way from china, they arrived fairly quickly. wore these on my cruise...dressy and classy.  was able to mix and match several ways. very comfortable. i am 5\\' 8&#34;. they were a little shorter than i like but i wore a 2&#34; heel and they were fine. i love them though they were a bit smaller than i\\'d expected. good incentive to drop a few pounds. otherwise a quality fun product that was promptly shipped. great pants! these have become one of my favorite pairs of workout pants. they are so comfy and the quality seems just fine, i was worried about the quality after reading some reviews. i am ordering more of these in different colors! beautiful color! love  them they are the most comfortable scrubs i\\'ve tried! i\\'m 5\\' 3&#34; and ordered petitte and they are still a little long though. will definitely buy these again.! i enjoy them, i just should have gotten a smaller size, but that is online shopping :) these are the best shaping capris i have ever found. they are also easy to care for and are thicker and more durable that most others.  i have purchased these in several colors. they are great for just running around or dressing up to wear to work. the waist band was big. but the feel of the material i love!!! i would get more if they have xsmall. i liked the slacks, but in dying them i guess i either left them in the dryer too long or had them on too high a heat.  they shrunk. perfect fit im about 5\\'5  5\\'6 125 pounds and these leggings fit perfectly. fabric is a stretchy spandix type material light in weight so wearing them in summer for a night out would not be a sweaty overheated issue. i bought three pair of these and love em all shipping took awhile but china isnt exactly next door and these are so worth the wait. fashion sucks in my area and i cant wait to shows these off wore one pair out already and everyone wants to know where i got them. warm and cozy but on the small size. i ordered medium and i am a size 6-8 they fit fine. these are pants to wear hiking or around the house, not dress pants. i like them and do not regret the purchase like it the seller is really considerate, if you are going to buy the pansy buy them a size bigger they tend to run small. the material and the fitting is really good. i am a size 8-10(bought a medium) and still have plenty of room to wear pants underneath.  they have belt loops and plenty of pockets for the mom on the go.  these are my first snow pants and i\\'m totally happy. i\\'m happy with these. i\\'m a larger woman- size 18, and i ordered the xl. fit well, and very comfortable. i have large hips and i was worried that the layers would add weight to my hips but it just looks like a fluffy skirt almost. very pleased with this purchase. i like the pants, they are comfortable and fit well. the fabric was thinner than what i expected, so i might not call this a &#34; great value&#34; comfortable and soft pants.  just great for wearing around the house. gave these as a gift for christmas. they are soooo soft. true to size. i bit short waisted but nothing too noticable. great deal! nice, thick & comfy  i ordred more! fit pretty large, pants were too long (i\\'m 5 foot 9) but still good quality, got delivered on time. wife loves them i love skinny jeans and i look so good in them, these are some great quality jeans thicker denim not that thick stuff that tears easily. i can slip write in to them and not have to fight with the buttons or zipper the pockets are roomy. very comfy.  they didn\\'t have the color i requested, but contacted customer support found another color and it\\'s fantastic.  so comfortable i got another pair love the pants, but even after washing and drying i couldn\\'t get them to shrink down enough.  my sister in law loves them.  so i bought a new pair.  this is my experience so i\\'ll share what i think.  if you\\'re generally a small person, in the right weight range, these are going to fit true to size, get the size recommendation for the inch measurement of your waist.  if you\\'re chunkier, don\\'t, go a size up and shrink them down.  they\\'ll fit better. these are cute but a little small...or it may be that i am a little big...hehe!  either way i do like them and they will be great travel comfy pants! length shrinks a bit in first washing, so allow for this.  otherwise, very comfy pants. adorable, but was expecting more of a nylon spandex knit, and this is more of a matte, cotton-like material. these are so amazing.  not see-thru like a lot like them, comfy, and i would wear them out or lounging around. buying more in other colors! bought this. love it. love the fabric. love , love love the cut. love it i love these yoga pants...i now own four of the same brand in different colors and i will continue to buy when mine ever wear out. sometimes they run a bit long but it doesn\\'t bother me. nice fit a little bit small they are great i love them they fit as expected and they are really comfortable fit s perfectly. thank you i really like these, super comfy. though they are a little loose in the croch they are perfectly fine and would wear them anywhere. super cute and for under $5.00 you can\\'t go wrong.  i\\'ve washed and worn these a few times and they\\'re holding up well. even up close the material looks like real denim.  super light weight, will be great in the summer as an alternative to actual jeans. you have to pay close attention to the sizing chart. in usa scale i wear a 1x but this was very much too small. i gave it to my very slim daughter who wears a 4 in usa scale and she fits it perfectly. score for her.<br /><br />i give it 5 stars because the material is as soft and silky as a dream and. it looks fabulous on my 19 year old and she loves the style of them.<br />the size issue is my fault for not reading the scale. next time i will. like the fabric and they fit nicely except for the length. quite a bit than expected. hope they can be shortened easily. :( good young seller. thicker fabric than i expected. my expecting daughter was pleased with the choice. very nice pants. i would recommend. i love these pants! soooo comfortable, and good looking. great fit and very comfy may be different colors and more variety of colors. that would be good. the fit is so comfortable and great. i really like the pants but wish they were about 2 inches longer love these. so comfortable. repeat purchase of these scrubs; they fit and wear well. excelent very unique cool looking pant.  we sized up 2x (to account for the small running &#34;asian&#34; sizing) and were surprised to find them actually a bit to big.  maybe go with 1x larger than your usual size.  very well made; good materials; nice design; looks just like the photos.  recommend ! waist is fine. my only problem is i\\'m only 5\\'2&#34; and they are several inches to long. most thing are so that\\'s no big deal. jsut perfect.got then eh 3 weeks late but they work. i don\\'t know what smell these reviews are talking about. i love them and i\\'m curvy so they fit great! love the way they look. need to make them a bit bigger. very comfortable, slightly baggy... but good nonetheless. wringe easy....handle with care. would recommend purchase! they\\'re true to size and very comfy. i\\'m 5\\'9\\\\\\\\\" and they\\'re the perfect length for me. might be long on people 5\\'6\\\\\\\\\" and shorter. heather grey is a bit see through. what can i add about the &#34;lindsey&#34; pant that hasn\\'t already been said? they are comfortable, have numerous pockets for work supplies, and fashionable. i purchased size small and although a little big, the drawstring waist allows me to pull them tight enough so that they don\\'t look baggy. it has plenty of pockets! very soft and nice silvery was super fast i will have to get d other color these pants met my expectations. i will wear them with my clergy attire. i am happy with my purchase. these are cute... a little thin but it worked out fine because i wear a long shirt to cover everything. very cute beach pants. they do run a little small, i\\'m a size 8-10 and the large fit perfect.  love that they are long enough (33&#34;-34&#34;) but have a drawstring to tighten them up with. super cute! ok i absolutely love these pants. they are very comfortable and also work well for professional settings. i would buy these again. good these are nice comfy leggings. they\\'re light weight tho but i just wear a long shirt & be careful about panty lines. i wash them by hand & lay them out over-night to dry. they\\'re very cute! these are soooo cute and comfy with the higher waist (i am so over pants with a 1inch zipper!!!!) and cool for the summer..get the next size larger. good fit, these pants are super comfortable.  as others have mentioned in their reviews, the material is a little bit thin, so if you plan to wear them in public make sure you don\\'t have bright patterned underwear on, or people may be able to see through. i like the colour in person. great fit. a little long, not much, because i am 5\\' even. they do work nicely for yoga. exactly as expected. came on time with no issues. i\\'m 5.11&#34; and this is very long. i will need to hem. the fabric is a little see through but you need to hold it against the light to see it. i like it. i love these pants . they came right on time for colder weather. i really love these pants, very comfortable.  length=perfect. i gave 4 stars because i found them to run on the large side, and i ordered a small. however, that did not stop me from ordering them in other colors;) i bought the spice brown crop pants 20w. i am 5\\'2\\\\\\\\\" they stopped just above my ankle. a little loose around the waist without the belt. other than that i loved these pants. you can dress them up or down. perfect pants, they look amazing on. compliments galore. shipping was super fast. highly recommended! love it she love her pants. wasn\\'t sure what to expect based on the reviews, but i love it! it\\'s super sexy & fits perfectly. arrived quickly too. these fit pretty well i must say.  i\\'m a woman, 160 lbs and 6\\'1&#34; - super tall.  so i\\'m always hesitant to get pants i haven\\'t tried on first because they\\'re usually way too short.  these aren\\'t bad.  they\\'re not as long as the image on me, maybe about mid capri to ankle length.  and they\\'re not drawstring, it\\'s just an elastic waist so don\\'t be fooled, but they do stretch super big and also don\\'t fall off.  so kudos on that.<br /><br />now i got mine in white, i\\'m making an aladdin costume, and they are see-through.  so you will need to wear a half slip under them or something.  they are so comfy though, i\\'m using them in my costume and then they are becoming lounge/sleep pants! cool lounging pants, comfortable. i wear a 12 and got a large which fit well. fabric is not what i expected as a silky style of yoga pant feels more like cotton but still a great price. keeping. this is my 2nd pair!  i love them!  they are perfect with flip flops for flat sandals not so much heels, but great summer outfit!  i am 5\\'7 and wear size 10-12 clothes normally.  after wearing them for a while they were starting to stretch and kept having to pull them up, but that was pretty much expected.  i love them and would love to buy more (coral ones) and already recommended them to a friend who just made her first purchase yesterday :) oh and btw the shipping was amazing!!  i got them like 4 days before expected!!!!  thanks ya\\'ll!!! the pants were too small. although the fabric and stitching was pretty solid, i am petite so they were a bit too long for me. i returned it because i know i wasn\\'t going to use it. amazon was really quick when i sent this back in for a refund. a great pair of pants for going out, for someone size small- medium and is tall. i liked the quality but it didn\\'t fit me. great scrubs for a reasonable price. i just got one set to start, but will definitely be buying more! comfort level is so important and these are very comfortable and i love all of the pockets. i\\'m a huge fan of stirrup pants, as they\\'re never &#34;too hot&#34; like jeans can be.  these are just right - if not a wee bit long. over all - i really like them! the scrubs are great this is my second purchase and the bottoms are as lovely as the top. right out of the bag there is no scent or odor whatsoever. (an issue for me.) they are soft and very very comfy. i really like the extra wide band at the bottom, it seems to keep you that much warmer. someone complained this material was thin but i don\\'t find it the least thin. they are oraganic wool, they feel really warm but they let your skin breath - amazing. yes, they are a little pricey but i\\'d rather pay for these than $20-30 dollars for something made less well. for me it\\'s worth it. i learned that after years of buying cheaper stuff. i\\'m planning to slowly add to my collection with more tops, camis, etc. i love the pajama pants. i have washed them several times and they are still the same size! very soft cotton and comfortable. practically identical to american apparel disco shorts except the back pockets aren\\'t rounded. other than that they\\'re perfect. estimated delivery was for a month and a half i got them within a week and a half. i love these pants. i travel a lot and they are the perfect travel pant. the fabric is light and comfortable, the waist band is super comfy. better than my favorite pair of jeans. yeah!<br /><br />the color is so vibrant and pairs great with all the neutrals i have in my closet. seriously perfect they are purple in color my daughter loves them i ordered a size up due to other reviewers, but i think it would work better (as a slimmer) if i had stayed true to my size. i\\'m in love with these! super lightweight material and not at all see through. great summer pants. i will definitely be buying these again! i now have 3 pairs! i\\'ll neeed to exchange these. the quality is clearly good although the black &#34;stripe&#34; isn\\'t really noticeable to me (maybe in the colored ones it is?) i got a size i\\'ve been buying for a little while now and almost got one size smaller but decided i\\'d rather they be a bit baggy than too tight. but when they came they were so large they fell right down!!! lol,  i\\'m exchanging for a size large instead! yay! i am medium in women section but according to reviews i bought the bigger size (xl) and it fits well. i can wear it on my jeans too!! these pants keep me warm and dry and very comfortable. perfect i love these, but i need small!! great product i love koi lindsey\\'s they\\'re my favorite! these pants are great for theses lazy day at home i bought these for my girlfriend and she loves them. they look great on her and she says they\\'re very comfortable. i am 5\\'10\\'\\', 205 lbs, muscular build and bought these in xl. they arrived double wrapped in plastic and with several tags on them (too much packaging). the back pocket was too narrow for my hand or to store a wallet. the drawstring was too short. the waistband fit just fine. the legs were too wide even with jeans on underneath the pants. the velcro at the cuffs did not close tight enough to be snug against my ankles. the legs were about 2&#34; too long. all in all it\\'s still a top quality product that i would recommend. i\\'m glad they offer it in khaki on the patagonia website while all the other companies only make rain pants in boring black. room for improvement, patagonia. get rid of the packaging it only needs to be single wrapped in paper with no tags...people can look online to get info about the product you don\\'t need tags. perfect size for mee love love love a++++ seller love these - i get many compliments when i wear these out.  very edgy and ecclectic. but they are good.  i just know next time to get a smaller size! this is a very cute shirt, not a dress as described. the material is a bit thin, but the aplique is quite pretty. too bad the shirt was too small for me. it runs extremely small. thankfully, jacqueline\\'s was very helpful in processing my return and even covered the cost of shipping to return the item. i\\'m sorry it didn\\'t fit. these are literally the most comfortable pants i\\'ve ever put on! these are officially my favorite pants. they are somewhat fragile, so i hand wash. i love the stretch fit and to be honest, i have to look down to make sure i have pants on! love them, thank you. in legs tight but hips loose very colorful they fit perfectly (: just got it today, and currently wearing them. the drawstrings were a little long but other than that i\\'m pretty satisfied. i wear a medium so that is what i ordered and they don\\'t run small at all. i don\\'t know how the size will change when i wash though, but so far so good. good value.  not too baggy. these pants fit perfectly, and the fabric feels amazing! love! love them, so soft and fit perfectly! like it beautiful capris these thick tights are great with a tunic or for extra warmth in the winter. they do fit comfortably, but i\\'ve found they sometimes ride down in the back - solved this easily by running a ribbon through the casing to make a drawstring. not quite ankle-length on me but i do have long legs. 5\\'3&#34; 105lb, hard to find scrub pants that fit, but these were perfect. i am so happy i read the reviews prior to purchasing these pants. i am normally a size 5, but after reading they ran small i decided to order a 7/8. they fit perfectly. i love my tights! i bought them when i was single so my bf hates them but i wore them once! only out of respect for him i don\\'t wear them anymore and wont order these in every style and color!!!!! great purchases! great pants! you can dress these up or down. i wear them with a cami and a t-shirt on top. then add my yoga sandals. makes for a really cute outfit. they are very flattering. i wear a 9/11 and ordered the small. they fit perfect. very compfy. wash in cold and dry on medium heat. i have ordered 3 of these and not stopping till i get every color!! nice beautiful pants, but run small.about 2 sizes. not worth sending back though since you have to pay shipping both ways and it\\'s only 8.99. they fit great.. however after only wearing them twice, strings are coming from the sides and pockets. i wish they had better craftsmanship. i think it is very good, but it will be better if pants would be a little narrow, anyway i like it. ;)) ordered a 20 to big. i\\'m 5 7&#34; 165 baby curves love them ordering two sizes smaller. normal size is 14 i love these! they fit me perfectly, so comfortable and look great! i am 5\\'10, huge on top, a bit of a belly then hips that tend more to narrow. i usually wear a xl on top (or bigger) and a l on bottom. i bought the l in rust, the leg hits the top of my foot which is perfect, hope there\\'s no shrinkage. love them so much i\\'ll likely get a 2nd pair in the same color as a back-up. the color is gorgeous, the foldover is in just the right place and they look great on my backside. the fabric is soft, comfortable with gentle stretch...not at all binding. couldn\\'t be happier. if you want to be fashion, modern and elegant without spending too much money, this is exactly the type of purchase you want to do. i just received my order. the item arrived 2 weeks earlier from the expected delivery date and i was really surprised with the quality of the material and how well it fits on me based on the price that it have cost. the only think i didn\\'t liked was the pockets, they are too large, but it\\'s something i can fixed it easily at home. my wife is happy great pants. i love this pants! they are so cute and fit perfectly! these pants are great! i\\'m about 5\\'4&#34; 140lbs. there\\'s no see through at all. saw these same leggings on a different website for $89! love these! love the color and style of the green a-1 color pant.  reminds me of some plaid pants i had in the 80\\'s, but better style and fit.  the fit is as expected and the small is about right for a 26 or 27 inch waist (size 4-6).  the material is a comfy stretch - 50% cotton/45% poly and 5% spandex.  the color in the photo is pretty accurate to what actually arrived.  will look forward to wearing these with tall boots and blazers. i was going to order a med. bc that is what i usually wear, but the sizing chart told me to do a small. i was hesitant but i trusted the chart, and sure enough they fit perfect! these pants are awesome. i love the colors.<br />i own some other hippie looking pants that are nice, but the fabric gets staticky and it has some other flaws. these are a lot better.<br />i love how comfortable they are and even though the fabric is nothing fancy, it\\'s nice and exactly what i wanted.<br />i used them 4 or 5 times already, and washed them once. i have no complaints. fit perfectly and looks exactly as pictured. i absolutely love there unique pants. my order was handled expeditiously and arrived sooner than i expected. the customer service was remarkable and refreshing. i received a personalized thank you note from kailey and kaygan with my order -- very rare in this day and age! i will definitely shop kissue more in the future! i wear an xxl, but i ordered a large. it fits great. love these pants!  they do not stretch out and are plenty long, i am 5\\'8&#34;. very sliming\\' over a year old and still holding up.  they are thiner so good for warm nights. the pants arrived on time, fit perfectly and at a great price. i am 5\\'2&#34;, 125 lbs. usually wear 2/4 so i ordered the small and they are sexy, lightweight and move well. will be ordering more of in other colors! i first got these in beige.  they are a very light material and they showed all my dimples.  too revealing.  but such cutie style. i reordered in black and a size larger.  i love them. i received these pants in a sweet pink bag and wrapped in lovely pink tissue paper. it was like opening a present! the quality of the material was obvious as soon as i took them out. i put them on and ohhh they felt like heaven! they fit perfectly without being too tight or too loose! the length was right on the mark. they feel luxurious on and make me feel like a million bucks! they flex with you and are comfortable to wear in a formal setting, office, night out on the town, anywhere you go these pants can go too!<br />* i received this product for free or at a reduced price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. i was not compensated for my review and all my opinions are my own. one may or may not have the same results as myself when using this product. i loved it dis pants is very nice fits a lil big but is gorgeous i gave five stars because i\\'m excited for buying this. i want to wear it already. i\\'m in love with it! i love how it looks when i put it on! :d as expected. fits great. love these scrubs. cool look that allow movement. fit so comfortable these pants fit great. material is very nice. better than what they sell locally for the price. i\\'m in love with these! these pants are great. they stretch so you have some room in them. material is that silky stretch not cotton stretch.  the color is spot on.  the only thing is they are really long. and the seam on the bottom is not sewn. buy i take that as  you cut cut them to fit yourself.  at least that\\'s what i did. comfy fabric, does stretch some but the legs are a little short. these will be my around the house pants but deffinitely not for going out in public. i might recommend for women with small thighs. love the color though, void and perfect! i read a review that stated the pants shrank after washing, so i bought one size larger than i usually wear. i washed them<br />and i don\\'t think they shrank that much. i love the fabric and the feel of them, i do believe i will have to iron them before<br />wearing but they do look good on. cool very elegant.  nice material. i ordered the large, eventhough i wear medium. but it fitted perfectly. i recommemd it. ave become a staple of my wardrobe! super cute just a bit shorter and smaller than i thought. took forever to get here, not in time for 4th of july. worth the $ i bought these in a large im 5 10 and 160 and these still hit the floor. i washed cold and hung to dry and still fit just fine!! fitted as expected. the waist line is tight, as others have stated. the length of the legs do not go all the way down to your ankles as it looks in the picture. they go about 1 1/2&#34; above the ankle. i am 5\\'3&#34; 155lbs, i do have somewhat of a stomach, but that is not way the wiast is tight, when you go to try them on it just doesn\\'t give at all. i will keep them and wear with sandals & cute top! wear so well and feel so comfprtable. i got these in black as a christmas present and they are very comfortable and soft.  the only thing i don\\'t like is they are very long.  i ordered a size up because while the medium fit, they were very tight and i didn\\'t want them that tight. these pants are so nice an toasty!  my only complaint is they seem to run a little small.  at least i think so.  it may just be because there is no spandex in them!  not sure in this now spandex world.  if you are in between sizes, i would go larger. :) these pants are great. i have very muscular legs and the thought of buying pants gives me thoughts of dread. these fit beautifully. had to buy extra large and initially they felt snug on my thighs. i washed them and they did not shrink. they loosed a bit with wear and fit perfectly. i am buying another pair. great capri\\'s. well made.  material not too thick, not too think.  i got navy and chocolate. i love them both. pretty fancy fit good and perfect for spring nothing else to tell.....<br />people should try it...should bring more desings. some more<br />fancy desings great pj these were fine i did wash them they do wrinkle they are thin stretchy cloth i like the color of them and they are comfy very nice! true to size. dries wrinkle free when washed and hung to dry! its the best thanks a lot dear  i will deal with u guys later<br />regards thanks a lot again  . fits as expected i do a lot of online shopping and i fear for what i may get in the mail. the material is nice, the craftsmanship of the garment is very good. these pants are nicely flowing, it is not too long or too short. the color is very nice. i washed it and laid it out to dry, and it still looks like the photo. i would recommend this pants. super comfy. i love being able to be cute and comfortable all at the same time! wonderful awesome great love love love them, great fit and comfortable and does what they should i love it nice quality but fit is a bit large i would like one size smaller great bottoms not to short or long perfect length and fitting is great ! wish they came in other colors love my outfit these pants are perfect for travel.  roll them up, throw them in your suitcase & they come out without wrinkles.  if you\\'ve got a bit of a tummy only wear with long shirts, they don\\'t hide anything and don\\'t hold anything in.  they\\'re perfect for business travel as they are not tight and look like regular dress pants. super comfy pants - they definitely are cropped and i\\'m 5 foot 3 and they fall above my ankles.  i weigh about 142 and normally take a petite size 10 and these were an inch or 2 big around the waist but still comfortable. loved them. koi quality they are great pants for 10.00 dollars i am completely in love with these pants. the colors are so vibrant. the pants are made out of a silk-like material which makes them soft and light weight (perfect for summer). i ordered a medium and they fit great, however, they are extremely long on me. i used some fashion tape glue to make them shorter instead of cutting them, and that fixed the problem. i love these and gotten several compliments on them when i wear them. they are long enough for me to wear a small heel with super comfortable super cute these are very nice leggings. i enjoy the fit and comfort. great for longer tunics and sweaters. i think they will wear well over time. wish these could come in faster, but great pants. i had no problems with my order. i got exactly what i wanted and got it exactly when i was told i would get it. love koi scrubs! they come in tall which is nice for us tall ladies. they have different colors to choose from so its easy to match. they are stylish & comfortable. also, came on time. great product and fast shipping! love it! material is really nice and fits perfect. awesome price as well great styling for a casual pair of paints. oops, did i write paints, i meant to write pants.  even with my worse english, these capri pants are still great for the summer. the fit was absolutely perfect.  they are so comfortable it is amazing.  will be ordering more of them. thank you love them. so comfy. the pants are tighter further down the leg, which is not something i expected. they\\'re tight until about mid-calf , but they\\'re great! okay, so i am petite about 5\\'1 and 105 lbs and i bought the size 8.  way too big. no problem, i have a friend who i gave them to. so then, i bought a size 6 and they fit well (with a belt). there is plenty of wiggle room (if one like that). i am afraid to get the size 4, because i want to be able bend and stretch without having to break a seam. i bought these for hiking, so love the numerous pockets (for camera filters, chap stick, lotions, and so forth). i also want to add, that the material on some of the pants are different. i bought the army green (by the way, the material is so thick, if i were to fall off a rock or cliff, i would not have any cuts or abrasions) thick material. then i bought the brown pair. this material is much thinner than the army green ones. if i were to fall with those, i would surely get cuts and bruises. i also bought the khaki\\'s, but like the army green pants, these too, are made from a very thick material. overall, i loved them. if you are petite like myself, but like form fitting, i would go for the size 4. if wiggle room is what you are looking for (but not enough wiggle room to make a rap video), then the size 6 is the way to go. hope that helps anybody interested in these pants. ordered these for a a s.fla summer wedding. could not have been more appropriate. love the fit and patterns. i rocked and i am 78 years young and in a wheelchair. got more compliments than i could handle. plan to wear halloween & work outs, very cute! great! love them! love the style but does run small. but one size up for added comfort. i\\'m pretty petite and they just barely fit me! they look great! i will order another size bigger next time, however these were the first pair of jeggings i have ever ordered and tried. i was quite surprised that i really enjoyed them! loved the way they looked and received more compliments on them than expected! the color is a little darker than the picture. i love the fit and the color. good quality, but the size was bigger than expected unfortunately, i haven\\'t had the opportunity to test the comfort of the shorts while riding my bike. i\\'ll update later. they fit perfect. i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; and weigh approximately 145...medium is perfect for me. they get a 4 for the fit. if they keep my bottom from hurting while riding my bike, they\\'ll get a 5 star rating from me. received and just what i expected, getting ready to order two more !!! i love these pants. i now own 12 pairs. i\\'m 5\\'2 and 115 lbs. i got the size small and they fit me very well. not too tight around the waist, which is awesome (i\\'m 43 and have a slight &#34;40ish woman pooch&#34; lately). the pants are definitely not fitted tight to the legs like most workout/yoga pants. i\\'ve added a picture to compare. there sizing are in the larger side.  the color as shown in the picture. will reorder in a smaller size. pants fits a little big but very comfy. so classy and soft. perfect in every way. i love this style of landau pants i will be ordering again. order came quick and as i expected also the price is reasonable. love it. soft fabric and very cute. sizes do run a little small. it got shipped within the estimated time with no damage. so warm and comfy.  worth every penny.  i\\'ve even worn them under ski pants on the mountain in -15 weather! i love it... it fits great on me. i\\'m 5\\'6 and 145 pounds.. m-l is perfect for me. they looks nice and comfy..be aware ordering denim jean. i ordered twice colors and the denin one came damage and when i put it on my hand got durty. i read the reviews so i order two pant sizes smaller. i\\'m a size 22  about 269lbs so i order a size 20.i wish i would of order a size 18 for they can fit me perfectly.they do tend to get a little lose on the waist. i wear them a lot so there great .the only complain i have is the price mostly because i\\'m on a college budget. i order these because i got an amzon gift card for my birthday. material seem cheap. like those 12 dollars skinny jegging you would buy at ross. i would only buy this again if they lower the price.call me cheap but i\\'m a college student and i need to save my money. love them ..favorite scrubs that won\\'t fade in color very nice and comfortable. these slacks are true to size.  they wash up nicely, dry quickly, and need no ironing.  the creases in the pant legs stay crisp, even after five washings (so far). i love them! great quality not see through and super slimming! ive boughten 4 pair! luv my pants.. and i get tons of compliments on them...6 stars..!!!  i\\'m pleased..i will tell my friends where i purchased them.. these are nice pants i\\'m six foot. 245. ordered 3x. they look great and can be worn with a t-shirt and sandals or wear for a yoga,or dance class or just lounging,  they are that comfortable. ordered 3 more pairs. my third pair now in different colors. fit great and the most comfortable pajama/lounge pants i own. too much material for me to wear working out but don\\'t even care lol. these are great pajamas.  very soft and not too thick.  the design is cute as well.  they do run large though.  i got a medium and very large on me.  hoping that will shrink a little after washing.  i am 118lbs 5\\'5 for reference. love all the designs, very colorful.  have great compliments everytime i wear them out. i always buy koi, they are flattering, wash well, and last years i love the material awesome!  comfy, very light weight, i want to wear these all the time. they look really nice. i plan on reordering very nice capri\\'s. very comfortable. i highly recommend them. fits good alittle loose in some spots absolutely love them!! thinner than i expected, semi see through but so comfortable! wearing them right now and planning on buying more patterns in the future these are certainly a great deal for the price. the stitching seems pretty durable, the colors are very vibrant, and the texture is perfect. cloth stuff is good so soft. i am going to order a small because the medium was a bit large. you can fold over the waste or where it up. i bought these to wear after having a baby and love them! &#60;3 perfect fit for me and it has the can\\'t-function-without cargo side pocket. i\\'d only with the cargo would hold more... well, cargo. other than that, wonderful. good so happy to find these studded crops to replace the pair i have had for couple of years. so comfortable and so snappy looking. really awesome cargo pants!! just what i was looking for in cargo pants!!! very long on me and see-thru but most yoga pants are so that was expected. other than that they fit great and i love them!! they are very soft & lightweight i love koi scrubs so much, i\\'ve been hooked for three years!  i\\'m a therapist and the pockets and lightweight fit are awesome.  the stitching is also very strong and the pants hold up very well!  the one thing i will advise is that the lindsey fit fabrics do not stretch at all and different colors have slightly different textures (some are softer than others). love my pants! like them alot. perfect very cute pants!  love!  great quality too! amazing! get the biggest size these are a pretty color - nicer than photo - - very lightweight fabric that won\\'t wrinkle and stretches for comfort.  not binding . i bought these for a gift for my daughter, bought her normal size, and she said they were barely big enough - and she\\'s been working out and losing inches off her hips!  i told her cold water and line dry as they are 100% cotton.  but she loved the print & the styling.  i cut them to capri length and used the extra fabric to make ruffled hems on the legs.  really turned out cute! great quality for the price, but after reading the reviews, i decided to order a size smaller and guess what, they were too small. the top fit fine, but the pants were too small. these are very nice pants. nice material and quality. its a little too long however i can fix the easily. it feels great! with pockets out of style this is the way to go. i put them on backwards accidentally and they were still comfy. these pants fit perfectly for me. they feel very comfortable and are nice quality pants. i can see myself wearing them during the fall and winter and have a cute design. i i received this product in exchange for a review. luv these pants. they are just what i had expected. and i luv the terry cloth material they are made with. keeps me warm this winter. love these, my fav pair of scrub pants yet! good this is my second pair i love how they fit and feel! so comfy!! want more colors i get lots of compliments and wear them tons.  they are stylish and my pair is well made.  one thing about the waist is that once the washing shrink has eased up i need a belt to keep the waist at midrise instead of lowrise.  these crop denim jeans are a long \\\\\\\\\"pegged\\\\\\\\\" ankle length on this 5\\'-1\\\\\\\\\" gal.  great bargain, love the jeans. perfect.  comfortable.  love them! wasn\\'t sure at first how these would fit me, being that i am 5\\'1&#34;. they fit pretty good! little long, but most pants are for me, so i will just need to get them shortened. cute style though and a great price! i will eventually buy another pair. am so bored with dark colors and grays; these add spice to my closet, and can wear them out with boots--- they won\\'t just be loungers ! very cute but too small for me. purchased for my fashion forward 16 year old. they are very nice material and unique fashion statement. happy with purchase. i bought one pair and came back foe two more just in 2 different colors. fits well price good. comfy i like these. but they\\'re a bit large and i wear a medium i love these. they are comfortable and flowing. these r good if you have a larger bottom half. they can be either comfty and casual or they can be dressed up...they would even be good to wear to dance class. the only issue i could see happening with these is getting camel toe. i dont wear shorter shirts so im not to concerned with it but if a short shirt was worn with it...its a possibility will go good with dresse  and tops thi summer. absolutely loved these shorts, i got so many compliments about them. many wanting a pair. they are very flattering too. i got both the black pair and aqua color. they are great material and very comfy. normally a 26. had to buy a 25. the leg opening is slim, not legging tight. if they were the slightest bit more slim at the leg opening, i would give 5 stars i need a lower rise panty to wear these pants but they fit great. my hubby loved them on me. i\\'m not the tallest person around, but i hate when plus size pants always seem to shrink up on me!! these pants are definitely plenty long. but i also love that the material is sturdy, they are well sewn and the waistband is a nice thick elastic. i love how they feel on me and all positives are well worth me having to hem them up an inch or two. i will definitely be buying more of these! i work out, but don\\'t do yoga - i just think the pants are adorable.  and these seem to stay up better than another pair i purchased.  still would not wear them to the gym for fear of butt cleavage showing.  i love them for stretching out/isometric exercising/free weights at home or tv night on the couch with friends.  5\\'6\\\\\\\\\" at 128 lbs - i got the small size, wish they were a smidge longer so i could wear them with my dr.scholl\\'s dance clogs. i absolutely love these pants. they are ok...not super great but i like them.. i\\'m about 5\\'7&#34; 108lbs, loose fit as pictured.. i really like these pants. only problem was expected. in other reviews i read that the fold over top of pants was loose. these would be perfect if it was not so loose. gave to my daughter absolutely love these pants. own 3 pairs!! these pants are great fit and the fennel green is an outstanding and classy color! i highly recommend these pants. very comfortable and nice material.  these capris have some stretch, but they feel very comfortable. bought them for my daughter and she loves them ! they fit perfectly and look great. good quality and they arrived early. these aren\\'t anything great and thats what i like about them. they are plain and basic. i ordered a small and they are definitely small. the material is pretty thin so you may want to be choosy about the size you get. i probably should have ordered a medium. fast shipping and great material. very nice, good fit, washed well and did not shrink, and didn\\'t even need to iron them.  very nice summertime capri pants.  i will enjoy them, and would recommend them.  especially good price, too. this is a silky material, i brought it for the purpose of wearing it to bed. works for me! i purchased these pj\\'s as a push present for myself. i wanted to have something nice & soft against my skin in the hospital after delivery & this fit the bill. the only reason this is a 4 vs 5 is because of the sleeves. they fit my forearms (which are a bit bigger than the average) fine, not too tight or confining. however once on i couldn\\'t roll up the sleeves. i could push the sleeves as far back as just above my wrists but no further. the reason for this seemed to be the stitching at the cuff. other than that i lover these pjs, it was a nice postpartum gift to myself. these pants are great!!  the fabric is a little cheap, but i still love them!! these joggers have a great pattern and high-quality &#34;love&#34; emblem. they also fit true to size (juniors sizing). however the inside of the pants is somewhat scratchy. similar looking joggers at target are softer on the inside than these. i was hoping for more softness for the inflated la retail price. they are also thin so i will use them more in the spring over my workout clothes, too thin for a cold midwest winter. easy to wear. stays on without needing to re-tie the belt. survived burning man and a machine wash. even shipped in a cloth carrying bag. i got a large but they were a little snug of the several pairs of sleep pants i ordered these are my favorites. they are comfortable, well made of nice material and fit just perfectly. at some point i am going to order more of these. they are great for lounging and sleeping. i love these pants!  the only improvement i would want is if they had pockets.  they are comfortable, they look great, they are the perfect length with sandals (i am 5\\'8&#34;).  i got three pair and am happy i did.  i wish they came in solid colors too. easy, breezy, beautiful harem pants. wore these as part of a costume. ended up becoming apart of my normal wardrobe. excellent these pants are amazing! you want something comfortable and cute at the same time? these are your answer! - i am 5\\'8&#34; and ordered a large because my legs are long. they fit pretty good. i will probably order a medium from now on, but i want to own these in every color!!!! - note: this is not normal jegging material. it is more of a legging material - but still super cute and comfy! love! they are great pants very comfortable just run a little large. great fit and amazingly comfortable. i am 5\\'6\\'\\' about 140lbs and they fit great, but they are about 1in too long. i dont like my pants dragging, so the first time i wore them i just pulled them all the way up, i\\'ll get them altered one day. but i\\'ll wait until i buy more of them to them all in :) very cute, fits well, a bit see through. so comfy!  i love these pants just got these in the mail today, and i looooooooooove them!!! they fit perfectly, the height of the legging on the leg is super flattering, which i was worried about with a capril legging. also, they are so soft! i tried them on under one of my summer tunics and i couldn\\'t even feel them; they aren\\'t heavy like lot of leggings. going to check more out from this seller and buy, buy, buy!! love!! i read a previous review that said &#34;like and old lady&#34; or something to that effect. yes, if you want pants that don\\'t ride down on your pelvis, 5 inches below your belly-button, that would be correct. these ride at the waist, or just below, and are very comfortable. i ordered the black in a size large and it fit great. the style is super cute and can be dressed up or down. unfortunately it does shrink easily so be carefully when you wash it. i plan on ordering the green in an extra large. love them great pants used on the treadmill. feel smooth, & moves with you. good quality for price and fast shipping. they fit very small, so order a size larger did not realize how small they fiited on me though, but i called them the day i received it to work out an exchange and they were able to help me out and get the right size no questions asked! customer service was very helpful and these leggings are super sleek and sexy! i will definantly come back here again great pants, they don\\'t dry well i recommend hanging. i got the light blue and i liked them. they were see through although many of the reviews said otherwise.  they fit well around the legs. i ordered a size small were still a little bit around the waist. these were a very pleasant surprise. i bought thinking they would just be comfy summer pants for errands or lounging about but the fabric turned out a little more heftier than other harem style pants sold on amazon. more of a cotton knit than jersey knit, so these breathe well, drape nicely, and are lightweight and comfy without being too thin and clingy.  i love that they are office appropriate, i can wear a nice black blouse over these and it is a polished, stylish look.  please make more of these in solid colors! bought this for my daughter who is 5\\' 6 and wears a good size medium. the pants are a good length, and are thick enough that they are not see through. she wore them christmas day. very comfy and love the little owls. these shorts are amazing. i ordered the black ones and they were crazy comfy and amazing. the shipping was quick, being as i live in california and they shipped from china. (it took 12 days). i have a pretty curvy body and a biggish butt and i\\'m 120 lbs so i ordered a medium and they fit perfectly. they feel like nothing. i love them so much. i\\'m going to be wearing them with a black cropped top to six flags. &#60;3 thank youu!! &#60;3 product pic was perfect to decide how it fit.  the quality of linen was good and the shipping fast.  i got to take them on vacation for a last min purchase!  i have received numerous compliments. great purchase! i was worried but they have a light cottony feel! glad i purchased 2 colors. very light material, comfortable for lounging. absolutely love them there a tad to long but no big deal! there super comfy and look great the pants are a very nice fit and very comfortable and easy to take care of i am 5\\'10 and these fit perfectly! they are extremely soft and comfortable. chevere love the flow and the material! perfect for mother of the groom wedding at the ocean ! very cute skirt shorts love these bought these pants for my mother. they fit her perfectly. these are very comfortable light weight pants. perfect for hot florida weather. they can be dressed way down with flip flops and a tank top or dressed up a little with a nice shirt and a pair of cute sandals. they do seem to run a little large and i definitely had to pull the drawstring tight, but i haven\\'t washed them yet so they may or may not shrink. they are 95% cotton and 5% spandex which the description doesn\\'t mention so i wanted to add that here in case that was important to someone.  i purchased a size 20/22 which is the size i normally wear but these are a little roomy. i recommend ordering down a size. i love these!  mine fit just perfectly.  i am 5\\'5&#34; so the length was exactly right. nice and light as i\\'ve said i\\'m a bigger gal and have to watch out for sizing, but these pants are great! after a wash they were a little right around my calves and i\\'ve had trouble with throwing my legs up on the couch or apart to run to quickly and the seems tear, nothing i can\\'t fix but it is something you kind of have to watch out for. great deal for the price and very fashionable (: first of all i like to say the packaging was very nice they made sure they were protected it was wrapped like a gift and then a thank you sticker with my name on it.... they are very soft and comfortable i will be ordering more from this company they take great pride in their clothing items.. thank you.. i definitely recommend these yoga pants i was very happy with these pants.  the size was perfect and they looked very nice on.  the color is great.  i would recommend these to other women. i absolutley live these leggigs. you do have to ojrchase your true size because if not then it will be see through. i love the thick quality of them and love the gift they sent me along with my phrchase. oh, i can\\'t forget to mention the super fast shipping. ordered these on thursdayand arrived saturday morning. absolutley recommend them!! live everything about them. the shipping was quick too. so comfortable. i\\'d definitely buy more. she likes them. we have four horses. these pants are super flattering. fabric is thin but comfortable and really doesn\\'t seem to show flaws. the only reason they weren\\'t given 5 stars is that they really are super long! i\\'m 5\\'4&#34; and had to take off like 6&#34; to get the right length. i guess it\\'s a plus if you\\'re really tall! regardless, i\\'ll be getting another pair because they\\'re so flattering and comfortable. i\\'ll just have to consider the cost of tailoring in with the cost of the pants (good thing these are inexpensive!) good deal! love them!!! very vibrant in color and look just like photo! great buy these pants fit so good and are very comfortable awesome!!! seems like a great quality but way too small for a medium!  would fit a 12 year old. adorable definitely a little see through and wouldn\\'t recommend them as actual workout pants if you\\'re going to a gym with lots of people.... however, they serve perfectly for lounging and working out at your house! perfect for the price! love the pants, very comfortable. these pants are very warm. i found them too hot to sleep in, but on a night where you are cold or like me who go sick about a week after getting them they were exactly what i needed to bundle up and feel warm. they do have a lot of static so if i had to think of a negative that would be it. they kind of stick to you when you wear them. true to size; i am 5\\'7 and the length is good. great fit perfect they are super cute and definitely long enough just a little bit snug i really thought that i was going to have problems with these due to other posts from past buyers but i gotta say they are marvelous! they fit great to my body! not too short/long! also, the color looks great and they are very comfortable. they feel so soft against my skin! i will definitely consider purchasing them in other colors (: little thinner than expected but super sure anyhow i don\\'t mind for the price 😭 i used to hate yoga pants, then i gave them a chance... these fit perfectly, and are very comfortable. i wear them as pjs and for quick outings. will buy again! perfect! just what i needed to wear under my skirts! :) fits great it\\'s too tall so i\\'m wearing it as a high waisted pants with a body suit i live in this kind of pants at home.  these are great fitting and not too heavy. little long but nice fit .......but, they are very stretchy and vibrant, they don\\'t hug my curves in a very flattering way, but then agian i don\\'t have much for curves.... big sassy under a skirt or cute top same great fit as the capris!  love these pants! these are soooo thick and cozy!  just love \\'em! love them....very comfortable i love it. perfect beautiful material; made very well; good quality; drapes beautifully. i was nervous about ordering clothes shipped from china, because i hear a lot of people have quality issues. these shorts are great quality and they look fantastic! i got so many complements when i wore them, they look great and don\\'t break the bank. i am very pleased with this product and the quick service i received. thank you! i was really disappointed! these are super cute but run very small.<br />i wear a 10 and ordered a large. couldn\\'t even button them.<br />returned them. the material is nice and thick but not too thick to be hot. i highly recommend. the beige is more of a dark cream but still gresat color. i love the fit. awesome these were a birthday gift for my daughter, and they look great on her! they fit perfectly and they\\'re just cool! the package arrived quickly, and there were no flaws in the leggings. the print looks a bit different in person than the image - it\\'s kind of comic book/lichtenstein - which works. they\\'re funky cool. i love these pants.  i\\'m 5\\'5 and wear a medium in these, and i still had to hem them 2&quot;, but it\\'s worth it.  they fit just right and actually look a little more attractive than the picture would have you believe.  they are a little on the loose side through the thigh and just slightly flared from the knee down.  love them! excellent product recommend little scratchy but still comfortable. the pants were great, long legs, and wide. i had purchased based on others reviews that they ran big; however, had to return them for the next larger size (my normal maternity size). customer service was excellent and completed the return quickly and i received my next size pants quickly. i would suggest that you order true to your size if you have any butt or hips at all. i would highly recommend these pants! these are now being offered at my local kohls and this is much cheaper. exact same pants! hope i\\'m skinny enough to wear them soon. i wear a size 8 jeans and m or s compression leggings, and these don\\'t fit. yet. great pants super cute, better quality than expected. fit perfectly. i am 5\\'10&#34; and 125lbs. hits 2&#34; above ankle bone. item is really perfect quality, fits nice, and 100% wool! great quality from great seller, don\\'t miss a chance to buy true italian clothes! good work out pants fit ok just wish it have back pocket i am loving the pants. the material feels real comfy on your skin, and the belly part is very neatly done too. my only problem is the length. i am 5 feet tall. so my order was small size and i am happy with it, except if i am ever to use the pants for more than sleeping, i will need to cut of like 7 inches or so. the sizing is great elsewhere, but the length.. excellent fit! i read the reviews and purchased the medium (though i would have normally ordered a small in a legging).  for the price i didn\\'t expect much and figured i could donate them to our local clothes closet and maybe a really small person could enjoy them.  well, i am thrilled!!  though, i am small i do have a fleshy bottom and they fit great!  i actually wore an old pair of spanx under them and they looked great with a cami and a short sweater!  i also wore them with an ann taylor white blouse and black blazer.  i am about to order two more pair!  they do come to about belly button level and  i am short-waisted.  i would not consider them high-waisted.  they are great for the price even though they do fit small! i actually have the black ones!  i did order two more pair of the black and one pair of the white. love these pants.  they fit perfectly.  i normally wear a size 12.  i am 5\\'4&#34; with a 34 &#34; inseam. a little see-through but i bought for a safari and worked great - kept me warm/cool when i needed it, and kept the bugs out from the top and bottom. good for men. wore them at burning man. very comfortable. really comfy the fit was perfect.  very comfy and they give nice support.i can wear them with a casual or fancy outfit and they look great. these fit well.  the legs have a pull string which adds dimension. the material is soft. drawstring pants are best for waist exactness. i really like the fit and comfy feel of these pants. i\\'m a size 10  and 5ft 8 and age 55 -i usually would  fit into a medium but the size large was the way to go not to tight. the color is true to the picture and they are wrinkle free. the only negative is the label indicates they have to be hand washed vs. going into the washer. you need to be careful with the material on these pants because you can get a pull. i received many compliments when i wore these pants to work .the look is hip /professional not like your going to yoga class. the length is long and wedge sandals or heels would be worn not flats. i bought three more  pairs after my initial purchase that is how much i liked these pants. you can wear them to work and then go out after work with them. just wish the company would sell jackets to match the pants. everything is amazing. they\\'re comfortable and cute and i wear them basically everyday. the material is kinda cheap, but so is the price, so it goes. cool and breezy !! wearing this to the casino i love it just as expected these pants are cute but a little more snug than i was expecting.  wish i had ordered a size bigger.  also, they\\'re pretty long - i\\'m 5&#34; 5\\' so it\\'s not like i\\'m really short. love these pants, they fit pretty well. i\\'m 5\\'8 & wear 11/13. the large fit fine. they are a bit snug around the calf area however. as well, they\\'re not really harem pants but still cute. these are awesome and comfy they are a snug fit, but i believe that\\'s the style. i loved the ivory color of these wonderful pants.  however, the 16w was too large and baggy and unfortunately i had to return them.  i love the alfred dunner brand and have almost every color - except ivory.  it was difficult finding the ivory color in my size and i may try another size. pls i received my leggings a few days ago. i love them!!! they are so pretty and they fit perfectly!! the material is so soft and stretchy. i\\'m thinking about getting another pair soon. would be really nice to have in petite, regular, long lengths. great great romper cute just the yellow lining wasn\\'t all that great but cute i will possibly get another comfortable and attractive; very satisfied with the high quality fabric and cut. while it is a little too long, it fits well and is suitable for casual wear with flats or a pair of heels. will recommend for the &#34;young at heart.&#34; love these pants.  very versatile can wear in many ways and are super comfortable.  i get compliments on them every time i wear them they are super cute just a little tight. i can still wear them. fits perfectly!!! very comfortable to work in. love this brand and the seller is awesome! thank you! love it these fit fine, they\\'re just very long and drag a bit (i\\'m 5\\'3 got the medium). most comfortable pants i own these were very comfortable. i got them for a hippie work event, but ended up wearing something else. however they are so comfy i wear them as pj pants. the most comfortable pants i ever had comfortable fit. have not ridden in them fit well under regular shorts. i received excellent according to the publication , i would recommend. they are stretchy and comfy. material is a bit thin but i love them. i\\'m 5\\' 2&#34; 155 lb and they are a bit long but large is comfy for workout and sleep wow! great fit. great material. i ordered more~ these will be perfect for hiking as well as match shooting. lots of great pockets too. shipping was incredible! absolutely tickled and it only took 4 days to arrive~ looks even better in person, color is very vivid. pants are thinner so perfect for warmer weather. fits true to size juniors 5 medium. received very quickly. these pants are perfect in fit and color and will be my go to slacks for the holidays. thanks draper and damon and amazon.com for your great service. really like how it fits, would buy again. disappointed in the color.  not as shown but will be okay for around the house.  would not recommend them comfortable shorts, and the price was right! these pants are very comfortable. i wish they came in petite lengths, though, as i will need to shorten them. these are a little bit see through but i wear spandex underneath them. this is also for tinier people because i\\'m a size 0 and they are a bit tight on me but i love them! i think i\\'m going to buy another pair, they look great for the office but they are so comfy i wear them even if i\\'m just bumming around the house! it is fantastic. as always good to do business with amazon. its perfect. at last have found pants that fit perfectly.  most important to me is the length.  having short legs and average build, it has always been difficult to find pants that have the perfect length.  they usually need to be hemmed or are just a wee bit short.  the alfred dunner classics short length is perfect.  so glad i found them. i need this for my birthday asap b4 it sells out. hopefully i enjoy my birthday in this fab outfit. i know i will take plenty of pictures. perfect product! fast shipping! highly recommend! while these are definitely more magenta than red, they are very comfortable and held up well during our halloween activities. love it wife wears these pants all the time and loves them.  they are incredibly soft and fairly warm. these pants are light weight and very comfy, but if you are short like me you will have to hem them. awesome fit! i normally wear a size 2 and bought a medium. these shorts fit perfectly and look great on. they dont ride up but are pretty short...great product for the price! they ride up a bit, but otherwise fit well. i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; and wear a size 4 and i fit into these in a small, for those wondering about sizing. not any room to spare though c: . i already knew about the button hole so that wasn\\'t a disappointment to me... i\\'ve bought cheap jeans online before and the quality is better than i expected. they do look a little different to the picture, but they still look good to me. very happy about these. very lovely pattern and colors.  i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; and wear a size 6 in pants and these fit me perfectly.  the smocked waist is super comfortable.  i\\'ll probably be ordering another pair! love it nothing bad about them, just &#34;feels&#34; low quality, rough material. i love these pants. i\\'m just starting out in my nursing career and have been trying many types of scrubs to find the style that fits me and looks best on me. so far these are the winner (have also tried dickies gen flex cargo and wonderwinks). i love the yoga pant top. i\\'m 5\\'7, 145lbs and i bought the medium tall. usually regular scrubs flood terribly on me, i guess my legs are long. i think if i had to buy these again though, i would go with regular length. the bottom of these pants are dragging the ground on me and will have to be hemmed. that\\'s a minor problem though, and i would rather too long than too short. they have washed really well so far. i absolutely love this item... i purchased the black and white the design is wonderful the fabric is a little thin but if you go with your neutral undergarment that and the print will be fine. i am 4\\'11 150 i don\\'t think i would ever wear it as pants i absolutely love it as a jumpsuit. i would definitely purchase other colors ... wonderful garment for ga spring, summer and fall!!! comfortable while look great. i can wear them to an office meeting or dress them up to go out to dinner. these are sooo cute.  i ordered in black as well.  i wish they had more designs and colors! i like them i love the pants but i need to send them back for a larger size. just right these pants are just a wonderful fit and the color is a true navy blue which is often hard to find.  you wont be disappointed. the alfred dunner pants fit just right and i like them very much. the green and purple colors were perfect. really pleased with the fit and comfort. it rolls down when you bend. the fabric is breathable. it fits right on my legs, and i\\'m short, so if you\\'re tall, it will come to your knees. the price was good. they aren\\'t hot once you get moving. excellent!  will buy more soon.<br />thanks. it fits great, and it\\'s comfortable. a bit see through but not bad. so far the pants look pretty durable. i bought them for a halloween costume, we will see how they do with a day\\'s worth of wear. i adore these pants so much, one of my favorite pairs ever. i\\'m pregnant and the small fits perfect and is so comfertable. the only reason i didn\\'t give it 5 stars is because there was hole in the crotch after one use. not sure how, these pants are loose fitting but material could be cheap, maybe seam was already damaged, i don\\'t know...the material is very thin (the black isn\\'t see through) but i would still probably buy another pair because they are so cute and cozy. love it best freaking harem pants ever! the material is sooo soft and comfortable, gosh. &#60;3 i love them. i wear size small and the small fit ok, my waist is 28 so its a bit loose there but thats ok, i\\'m 5ft 7, length was perfect. soft fabric, cute animal pattern & motif - these are my third pair of hatley pajama bottoms.  if you are tall, there is another reason to love these, along with the comfy draw string & elastic waistband. a double thumbs up from me! these pants were what i expected. they fit fine and were true to size.  they are wearing and wash well. perfect addition for winter wear. it\\'s very comfy :) these are great! they\\'re very long for my 5\\'4 height but i\\'ve heard you can cut them without fraying. i\\'m a size 28, usually a medium, but found a medium to be a little large so i reordered  a smaller size. they material is exactly like other palazzo pants. these are great for cool weather. they are pretty nice! they oddly slink down a little in the back when i wear them, but nothing that makes them uncomfortable... it\\'s more that they are relatively high-waisted in the front, but the back slides down once i move. these pants run small so i bought one size larger than usual, perfect fit! can be worn as workout pants or for dress. highly recommend them. i love this capri swim pants. i can use it in swimming and during exercise. i love the fabric, it is lightweight and smooth. i hope i could get more of these! nice material and quality. size runs smaller than typical size. these pants are hot!, hot! hot!<br />im 5\\'9 170, with large muscular thighs and a booty you can sit a cup on.<br />these pants hug the curves and are very flattering.<br />i ordered a size large. the length is long enough for me to wear heels. the waist is high or you can pull it down to give more length or do a fold over to wear flats.<br />i ordered these on a friday and they were on my doorstep sunday. they fit better than i expected but do look a little like a skirt with leggings when standing still in them! otherwise extremely comfortable! washed well love them thank you my daughter loved this product - it was a birthday present, and the bottoms are really cute on her. perfect fit throughout! comfortable gold over waist band that doesn\\'t dig into belly. long flowing legs, cut to fit. love these pants!! these were really cool and were exactly what we expected. my daughter used these to dress up as a mermaid for halloween. very cute. great fit and found it comfortable and slimming very nice i love the style but the cloth is different.. not really fit with me these pants are thick and soft. i like them a lot. the pants fit very well!! very high quality material love these are officially my favorite workout pants/capri\\'s! i no longer worry about my pants falling down or tugging & they\\'re so comfortable that i\\'ve even worn them when cleaning my house. i\\'m about 5\\' 4ish&#34; lol & weigh 107. i purchased a size small. i hope this will help- i can\\'t tell u how many times i\\'ll read a comment on sizing but theres no info on either their size & weight, or what size they purchased. update: like them so much, i ordered another pair(blue) love! super soft, great fit, no complaints.  quality is as expected for the price. flowy and will keep me cool this summer and when i\\'m practicing yoga. good quality cotton leggings, fit well, are comfortable and soft.<br />would buy again. they feel good and have great coverage.  i hope they stay as fabulous when i go i vacation. love these pants very satisfied, they fit perfectly.<br />the only thing is that they are high waisted so i have to roll them or wear a long shirt to cover it. they fit as expected, came earlier than expected as overall are cute and good quality. the only thing i have a problem with is that the stitching in the front looks like it\\'s going to rip and the shorts will fall apart. i wish the sewing on the pair i received was better but i would probably buy another pair of these because they are very cute. these shorts are pretty cool. i\\'m normally a m-l gal, but i did have to go to xl (probably could have even gone xxl too) for these to work for me. they are comfy yoga-ish material. my husband says they look 1930s style which suits me just fine... great for hiding cellulite on back legs and not worrying about it. haven\\'t worked out in them yet, will report back. not for me. maybe if the denim was a chambray lighter weight denim it would\\'ve fit better. the denim is thick and hot. had to return. very soft and comfy! i\\'ve been looking for camo leggings that would be long enough ( i\\'m 5\\'7\\\\\\\\\" and 150) i ordered a large and they fot prefectly, very satisfied with this product! these pants were exactly what i was looking for, except that they run too small and don\\'t offer a size above medium. i am petite (5\\'0, 115 lbs), and i ordered the medium, which fit more like a small - xsmall. i bought pants almost exactly like these from charlotte russe about a year ago, and i love them. but i only have blue and red. i\\'ve been on a hunt for black since then. so, i was pretty sad that these didn\\'t work out when they arrived. i\\'m giving four stars, however, because the size really was the only thing wrong with them, in my opinion. if hde offered a large or sized their products a bit more true-to-size, i would have loved these pants. also, customer service rocked. i started a return through amazon\\'s returns page, and they contacted the seller immediately. within 3 minutes, i had a response from the seller. because they don\\'t refund shipping costs, they offered me a refund without my having to return the products. so, i got the money back, but didn\\'t have to deal with the hassle of reshipping or paying extra shipping costs (which really would have canceled out a refund anyway). i will likely just end up giving these to my niece or donating them to someone else who can actually wear them. pants is too long but i guess it can be accommodated with heels.  apart from the length it fits great and is lovely. i absolutely love these pants. they are so soft and comfy. they are a bit long but i love that. so many times my pajama pants end up getting shorter and shorter so the extra length is perfect. i have washed them a number of times and they still look fantastic. bright colors and the owls are adorable. i may just order an extra pair because i wear these so often i know they will eventually wear out. these pants were actually of a better quality than i expected.  the only thing is that the pants needed to hem, but that a small things for these great pants!! i love these pants.  i bought a pair last year while i was on vacation and loved the fabric, fit, comfort, etc.  they are as comfortable as wearing leggings, but are more versatile - you can actually wear them to work or a night out.  i could not find them anywhere on line except amazon!  i would recommend them to anyone and they are very slimming which is a huge plus, of course. love these pants! i am 5\\'10. i bought the talls in 18. they fit perfect and true to size. they are long even with my height but not too long. i am able to wear a 2&#34; heel and they are the perfect length. super comfy waistband and they fit perfect in all the right places. no funky weird areas. fits like a glove. soft material and they wash very well with very minimal shrinkage if any at all. i would recommend these. they are dressier than a yoga pant and are solid and semi thick so you cannot see through them. they are a mix between a great yoga pant and a nice pair of dress pants. can wear them for either. i love them! ran to large had send back these pants ran a little large, liked the style and color, but should have ordered a smaller size. they are cute awesome! i\\'ve been buying pants for weeks, trying to find the right ones for this fall and winter. when i opened these pants from land\\'s end, my husband was in the room with me. the first thing we noticed before we even unfolded the pants were the incredible \\\\\\\\\"hand\\\\\\\\\" of the fabric, the quality of the fabric is outstanding!! the second thing i noticed, as a seamstress, was the quality of the elastic in the waist, it\\'s a smooth, solid, invisible 2 inch elastic. someone sold me a pair of pants once with a skimpy 1/2 inch elastic in a 2 inch pocket. not these!! the waist is impeccible!!! the legs are not too wide nor too narrow. they are just the right width. the darts both front and back are nicely placed. these are the perfect pants. i\\'m on the computer now to order them in every color. land\\'s end hit a home run with these!!! this is a very good value for the price. i will not be able to wear it myself, though i wish i could, but with me being 5.9\\' , the pants are too short. the elastic band would sit in the middle of my cafes. tummy flab rolls down when jogging. they are great fabric the very too of the pants are too big so it doesn\\'t fit perfect however everywhere else in the pants fits true so i just can\\'t tuck shirts into it but i still live them i love these pants they are so comfortable but, i suggest if you buy these get them two sizes smaller they run very big i wear a 18 20 and i bought the 2 x and i am swimming in them i would of sent them back but they were so comfortable for me to wear around the house on my lazy days i just kept them and ordered another pair. they are so comfortable as long as they stay a reasonable price i am going to buy a pair of every color. good very nice pants. i didn\\'t realize they were low rise when i ordered, which is something i normally can not wear, they were doable.  if i squated they dipped to low in back, i wouldn\\'t mind them an inch or so higher but that\\'s my fault for not reading description. beautiful!!! great pants but they run a bit large for me... a little bit too strecthy for me, but the price was great! definitely comfy!  a few years ago, i bought marika magic pants, in fact i still have them, a much tighter fit. nice pajama bottoms for my sister, she loves them. these are my new favorite pants! i want them all :-)!! these pants are beautiful and flow great.  if you\\'re short though, these pants may be too long for you. i would love additional colors. i have two pairs now just so i can wear them the majority of my work week. this is the craziest piece of clothing i have ever seen! i wear it around as a joke! it is great for a bunch of laughs. for perfectly and are not thin where you see through but a panty line is seen. good for home use. very thin material. totally see through in light. unfinished hem. super long,  but very comfy for pajamas extremely happy! i bought this outfit for my daughter at a very reasonable price so i didn\\'t expect what i received...omgoodness!!  it\\'s adorable!  it\\'s very hard to please a 17 year old but when it got to the house, she loved it and it fit perfectly; happy ending for all. absolutely love them! perfect fit. i bought for my daughter, she loves these pants i bought a pair of these pants at nordstrom, wore them every day until they got a little faded from washing them, (a year later maybe?) then bought another pair.  looking to buy a third in a different colour.  i don\\'t miss regular jeans at all.  i remember the first time i tried these on i thought they were just so comfortable and fit so snugly, but not constrictingly tight like jeans do, because of the material.  fell in love right away and haven\\'t looked back.  unless you count looking back to check out how good my butt looks in these pants!!  :d  anyway, some observations...<br /><br />they do stretch out quite a bit.  i can only wear them 4-5 times between washes before they start to get baggy.  but wearing them fresh out of the dryer is like heaven.  also, they can stretch out around the knees for a bit of an odd buldge, but eh i don\\'t mind it so much.  just gotta work it, and just wash them when it gets unacceptable.  in general i have found them true to size.  i\\'m a size 2 to 4.<br /><br />i have had one of the belt loops rip when i pulled up my pants by it.  i just sewed it back on though, not a big deal.<br /><br />you have to be a bit more careful about not ripping these...i haven\\'t never had any rips or holes, but i\\'m conscious of the fact that it\\'s corduroy and haven\\'t gone sliding around on pavement.  and really for the number of times i\\'ve worn these pants, they must be pretty durable to still be in good shape. insulating, but not making you hot. as reported by other reviewers! i recommend them. they have a lovely sheen to them, too. awesome well made, nice uniform for the money. i really like these pants for there relaxed comfort.  no binding waistline makes them comfortable for all occassions. these pants fit true to size. they arrived on time. they are comfortable  and look good on. perfect for what i was looking for in a sweatpant. i love these pants!  i workout in them, i have gotten so many compliments on how awesome they are! the shipping took about 3 weeks, but i think they came from china so not bad! i recommend these pants to someone with personality! so they delivered in like two whole days do that was pretty amazing! but i bought then in an xl and i\\'m usually a medium so if you want them to fit yu a little loose and parachute pants like then definitely get it a few sizes bigger comfortable, fits great and you\\'ll be glad you got them !! (-:) so......order them .... whatever your size...for those that need plus sizes.... these are not the &#34; one size fits all &#34; stuff.... love them !!!! so... get some !!!! nice fit.  comfortable and light weight for hot days.  i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; and 135 pounds and the small fits well.  the legs are too long, but easy to hem. it\\'s exactly as the picture and information.  i bought it to wear on cold snowy mornings, or emergency days trying to get ready for work, costume add to etc. gave as a gift! loving these pants that fit well even if you are wearing a bulky cast!<br />modern look and easy maintainance fabric. i don\\'t think in these one size fit all  and it takes forever to get them these fit great but i just wish they had a lil more space in them. it is a little short, but i also have a long torso, but i love it.  i bought it in a medium, its super cute they came as expected and fit perfect. i love how them. will have to get more later in different colors i am usually 4, 27, or small in pants and these pants fit true to size. pants are very confortable. they have some pockets that i use for my gym card and the locker key. most comfortable pants ever! these are beautiful and the fit is great. perfect for summer! these are my favorite pants! koi scrubs always fit amazingly and last forever. the color does not fade.  i buy these in long and they are perfect for me who is 5\\'9 (without my daskos) ordered 3 pairs, love the fit. haven\\'t washed them yet, don\\'t know how that\\'s gonna work out. so far, i will order more if there were more colors. good,but a little bit short would order one size smaller next time but they still work and are very comfy with my pants that don\\'t have cushion it\\'s in the small size design looks beautiful in picture is better in pic that in person.<br />but for the price is good. bought them in many colors for a staple in my wardrobe.  they are comfortable and perfect for our warm az weather.  they wash up easily and do not wrinkle in a suitcase. very comfy linen pants for the summer. great buy! i am wearing these pants today for the first time and i love them.  the fit is good and they are very comfortable.  however, if you are short like me, i am 5\\'2&#34;, you will need to wear a higher heel.  they are long, but they look great with wedge shoes.  :) love it the color was greener than expected - much more of a turquoise green - but as that is my favorite color, i have no qualms with the difference from the picture!<br /><br />i thought the fabric would be cheap and sweaty but it literally feels like comfortable pajama pants that are super cute!<br /><br />i\\'m 5\\' tall and was worried that the pants would be too long - they are a little bit - but not too much that it\\'s a hindrance to me. i\\'m planning on getting these pants in a few more colors, i love them so much! i love these. they are a great alternative to sequined pants for anyone who doesn\\'t have a thigh gap. super comfy! i would only really wear them with a tunic length top, though, because the material is pretty thin and shows panty lines. fun wardrobe addition for a very cheap price. fits just like it should! i love these pants, i purchased a black pair. i\\'m getting every color. it\\'s hard for me to find office pants that don\\'t swallow me. my tip for those who are afraid of the pants being too tight, go with the size you wear in off-brand pants. i wear sizes 1-3 (26&#34; waist) with average &#34;pricier&#34; brands. but cheap brands i wear a 5-8. so i ordered a medium, it fits like a small. just as expected! great.  got for gift. in the picture...it looks ankle length. these are not, they go to my knees and i am not tall. i\\'m 5\\'2, i was going to wear these to school often, now it\\'s just clothes that i am going to have to wear when i have nothing else. i cannot complain since it is one size. other than that, they do look pretty, i like them! the pants are soft and warm  plus very comfortable to wear. no itching and you can walk and sit with ease. the color is a nice shade of gray and launders well. i like to lounge in them and do my errands. pants are beautiful and fit perfect i purchased the navy and black pants thursday and they arrived by saturday which is fabulous because i hate to wait! the packaging was gorgeous and i also got a small free gift so i was in heaven before i even saw them.  the pants fit to perfection and they are so nice i can even wear them at work! i\\'m 5\\'6 and lumpy on my best day so i\\'m always picky about my clothes i have love handles for days which is very hard to cover up but these pants do the trick they are flattering in all the right places and they even make my almost non existent booty look great they even reach the floor! i was very worried that they would be a little small since i have an odd shape and i\\'m hard to fit i ordered the large expecting them to be a little tight but they aren\\'t at all they fit great i would recommend these to anyone they are perfect for everything and since i always wash before i wear there was no shrinking tearing or fading (i used the gentle cycle with cold water and low heat which is recommended for most clothes)!  love love love great buy great price and fast shipping you can\\'t go wrong! these are adorable. i bought them for my 13 year old. she is 5/4 and 95 pounds, i bought the 28. very comfortable material.  a bit larger than expected. love these pants these are great jeans waist was higher than i expected. super soft and comfy! sexy and great looking on my wife..not expensive and seems to west/clean well..<br /><br />does pick up lint, get a sticky wand, she likes then so much she now has many..<br /><br />stylish as well.. omg!!!...absolutly beautiful fit.... i love them they fit just right. so comfy, perfect fit!!! washes great. they were a little tighter than i expected, but they still fit really well and i love the feel and the pockets! amazingly comfortable. good fit. quality material. very comfortable pants. wear them often. my wife got these to wear around the house and wears them all the time. she says they are really soft and comfy. she likes them so much she is planning on ordering more of them i love these pants, their so comfortable to wear whether it\\'s out or home it\\'s a pleasure to wear them!<br /><br />  thank you<br />  mrs ellen m. atwood pants are long, but were very easy to cut and maintain the cuteness of the patter at 5\\'4 i expect things to be long and was grateful to be able to cut them where i wanted fairly easy. good quality but application doesn`t match. i hope seller will resolve my problem. these are nice, a little thinner than i expected, but will be great for the hot summer days. nice pattern as the same photo to show but too thin cloth .it is great for summer. love it love these was shipped early and looks great. it is a bit too short for someone wanting a 34in inseam. but otherwise good. love these pants so much bought four more i usually wear a medium, and, fearing that this brand was geared toward juniors, went for a large to be safe. it\\'s actually a bit large so i guess they run true to size. but i like the larger fit for a lounge pant. these are super-comfy, and i\\'m glad i got them. i purchase the smarty pants to wear as a liner under my cycling pants.  because i commute to work by bicycle, i need to wash my gear frequently.  the cycle pants take too long to dry, but if i wear the smarty pants i don\\'t need to wash the padded pants as often - i can do a quick wash of the smartys and be good to go.  smarty pants used as a liner work great - they are comfortable and don\\'t bunch up and are nice and thin.  they dry quickly and are ready to use again in a jiffy.  to make them even more perfect, they could be an inch longer in the rise, but that may be because i need to lose a few pounds off my behind. ok, i am a size 10, so a one size fits all scares me every time!!! having sid that, these pants are amazing! they are light enough to wear on summer night, comfortable and move easily with my body. i even had steroid shots in my back where the waist of these pants fit and they did not irritate incisions! i will buy more of them! of course they will probably be a bit baggy on someone size 6 or under; but when i was that size, i enjoyed my pants riding lower on my hips! my daughter loves it!!! love these pants. very comfortable. great lounging around pants but also great casual look. material is not scratchy on skin. i like it!  so....  conformable! very nice assortment of patterns.  doubly cool since they\\'re reversible--even if you don\\'t like one side, you might like the other.  the workmanship is pretty good.  a little thready here and there and a couple seams weren\\'t quite finished, but considering the price, i\\'m not fazed by minor inconsistencies.<br /><br />since one-size items can be tricky where fit is concerned, here\\'s how they fit on two body types/heights:  i\\'m 5ft6, down to 155lbs, and wear average length jeans in anywhere from 8 to 12 depending on the manufacturer and style.  hourglass figure--best fit is curvy skinny jeans by ny&co.  definite waist, but &#34;baby got back,&#34; as well.  these are a great length if i tie them a bit below my natural waist.  if i tie them at my waist, they seem a little short as they just skim my ankles.  if i had less &#34;junk in the trunk&#34; the length might not be an issue if i tied them at my natural waist.  as far as coverage is concerned, i am happy to wear them around the house because they are *super-* comfy, but they\\'re a little revealing if a stiff breeze opens the slit up the side of the leg.  to feel comfortable wearing these outside the house, i\\'d have to add leggings or bike shorts, and that kind of defeats the purpose of the comfy fit.  so:  i love love love these for lounging around the house or porch, but i won\\'t wear them out anywhere.  still a great deal on a very comfy product.<br /><br />the other tester is 5ft2 and just shy of 120lbs.  no booty or thighs, but a bit of a tummy.  these pants were just dragging the floor when tied at the natural waist.  rolling the waist up a bit helped, but created a bulky waistline. they fit perfect. there really cute and comfortable. but they are see threw the pants are great but i had to take them up a couple of inches. first i only gave 4 stars because i haven\\'t worn them yet.  i love the fabric, some linens are so scratchy i can\\'t wear them.  this linen is soft and comfortable.  i have to get them shortened, but they are close to being the perfect linen pant.  now if it would just stop raining in vancouver and  let the sun shine.  it\\'s a prerequisite for wearing linen pants. high quality!  nice option to solid poly basics. could not be more perfect.  fits beautifully even after a swim.  the fabric is incredibly soft and comfortable.  love the cut and flare! fit very well i\\'m 5\\'1 and size 6 short big hips so i\\'m a bit curvy and this one piece flattered my figure! however the v cut is very open and i had to wear a tank underneath so the girls dont hang out! however i love it! great buy this is just what the doctor ordered. it is just picture perfect. more outfits that paint true pictures like this should be advertised more. i am happy with this purchase. i am a size 10, 5\\'4 and 140 lbs, and these fit great. i did have to roll up the cuff once, though, but they still look stylish. nice wide pant leg and the material really does look like grosgrain - so much nicer than plain old khaki. wife wears out and as casual wear or pj\\'s thank you! love it! love the pants, so many compliments love them the fit perfectly fun ! i ordered the red pants, and it\\'s a glorious red.  see photos.<br />they feel so good against the skin.<br />inseam is 2\\'7&#34; long, 31&#34;.  but they are way too long, possibly 5&#34; too long.  tag says they are &#34;tagged&#34; for easy hemming, but i don\\'t know what that means.  the lowest part is not hemmed, and it doesn\\'t fray.<br />i am 5\\'3&#34;, 130#, and ordered the xll, due to reviews on this product.  but they fit me comfortably.<br />the waistband is &#34;6 wide, but it can be folded in half and look good.  these aren\\'t sheer, like those other palazzo pants that are sold on amazon.<br />i will be buying another pair, if the hemming of these work out well. shipping was extremely fast! all good! extra long legs good: as a person with thick laps this pants definitely hide my weakness well. it feels comfy after several wash.<br /><br />bad: it\\'s kind of loose on waist. that\\'s comfortable but i\\'m constantly worried it may fall off. makes my behind look great, very comfy and quality material. i have three pairs now! these leggings are the best. the waistband is stretchy and the material is as well. being a plus sized woman it is hard to find leggings that fit perfectly. the design is perfect for a day out or even an interview.  there are also two shallow pockets. all and all i think this item is great i wouldn\\'t hesitate to buy it again. i received this item for inspection and an a unbiased review. love these pants. i bought a pair to wear around the house and would buy another pair. i bought the black pair with the blue waist band and they fit like a dream. i\\'m 5\\'5&#34;, 120lbs, and purchased the small - fit great! material is thick enough (is not see-through), but light weight. length is good, they don\\'t drag on the floor but aren\\'t too short. the only surprise was the word &#34;kiss&#34; embroidered in silver thread on the fold-down side of the blue waistband. since they\\'re only being worn around the house, no big deal, and kind of cute. overall - good buy for the price, would purchase again/more. i had a small issue with my order. you might wonder why then am i giving 5 stars? customer service!! amazing, quick, and friendly. they remedied the problem and went above and beyond to keep me as a customer. my replacement order had these pants and they are so comfortable. i love the fabric and the fold over waist. definitely not the kind of pants you would wear to work because a little bit see through, but i was very aware of that when ordering. great for relaxing around the house or low key errands, stuff like that. these are well made palazzo gaucho\\'s with very wide leg pants.  they run a bit on the small side, and are also a bit transparent when worn (you need to wear a pair of sheer to waist pantyhose, or no panties, as they will show underneath).  they are very comfortable to wear, the crotch area is a decent enough size so no binding, the leg length of these are very long, great with boots or stiletto heels, for wearing either casual or dressy.  all in all, a fabulous pair of palazzo gaucho pants for people who like comfort and style. pants are more fitted than expected, very comfortable love the long length it is a very soft and comfy high waisted bell bottoms pants. these are tie dye pants which are available in many colors, designs and sizes. i got in large size. it fits me very well. the bell bottoms pants are stretchy and feels very comfortable. i can easily sit, bend and do everything wearing these pants.<br />the material of the bell bottom pants is very gentle, soft and stretchy. the color combination  is wonderful. it can go with many colors of tops, shirts, blouse and even long shirts. i wear this with my cultural long shirt (kameez) and it looks so beautiful.<br />the fabric is high quality. this is not a cheap one which gets lint after few wash.<br />also you can style it with flat, wedges, sandal or high heels.<br />it is true to the size. fits perfectly.<br />i love wearing these bell bottom pants at home, a day out, bday party, graduation or any event. they look beautiful, elegant and stylish.<br />i have got so many compliments wearing these beautiful comfy pants.<br />i would highly recommend these tie dye bell bottom high waisted pants.<br />i am so glad i got these amazing pants on a promotional discounted rate in exchange of an unbiased opinion. however it didnt effect my thoughts about it. it\\'s so comfortable, and it fits good, i love it these have got to be some of the cutest capris i own.  the green color is really rich and saturated, and the print/embroidery is really pretty.  i get a lot of complements on these when i wear them.  comfortable and a perfect weight for all levels of activity. the color is a bit darker than what i expected but i love them. shipping wasn\\'t too long. and they fit great. i measured before i placed my order and the pants did not even go past my calves. however, i reached out to them and they got back to me in less than 24 hours. we decided it would be easier if they gave me a full refund rather than having me send back the pants as it would cost all of us more money. though the pants didn\\'t work out, they were all stars with customer service! ordered the largest but still too small. however i am in process of losing weight and hoping in 10-15lbs. that i will be able to wear them. i do love the way they look and appear to be cut for a girl and not a guy so i am keeping them.  if in a few months i still can\\'t get into will pass on to daughter of granddaughter as they are very cool love that they have belt loops. so giving a five star is great as they came in a timely fashion and look to be very well made.  thank you amazon and amazon seller. love my shorts!! fit good. fast shipping and will totally order again.<br />i\\'m 5\\'7 and a size 22 and waver between a 2-3x. i went with the 3x. fits good. they are very light and comfortable. perfect for everything. they\\'re a little longer in the leg then expected but not worth fussing about. i have been looking for some everyday pants to work in (i work at home). these went beyond my expectations. i usually buy a size larger than i need because it seems like all the pants i buy shrink in length, but these did not and i am please with the length. i have purchased two more pairs of this pant and will most likely buy more. not only do they work for the \\'home office\\' they are nice enough to go out on the town. they are very versatile. everything i have purchased i have been truly satisfied..  i love your apparel!! punk, and runway mixed!! one happy diva/ model/ stylist/ and/ shopper. red carpet ready, i wore my baggy hippie pants to a fashion week ny party. (real story) great pants. i bought 4 more so far these wash and wear fine. they are soft and comfortable and not over sized but not tight. they are something you could wear easy sweats if company came over. i ordered eight pairs of these pants. they arrived today, which is earlier than expected.  they are well made.  all the legs are even, despite the negative reviews. all my pants look just like the pictures. they fit well. they are a little long but i am only 5 3. i would definitely order more of these pants. look nice, super comfy loose in the waist but love it i bought  these for  my daughter, she absolutely loves them my fiance loves them. they arrived nicely packaged and in a very timely manner. they are kinda long but my lady is also on the short side so she expected to have to have them hemmed or whatever. they look great on her. the picture doesn\\'t due them justice, but my fiance\\'s butt does. just being real here. you got a nice butt? you like baggy pants that accent your butt? you like eye catching pattern? want dudes to notice said butt? but these funky named pants. i too used to get the victoria\\'s secret yoga fold over pant, but they are too pricey. these fit great! i\\'m 5\\'6&#34;/135lbs and the medium fit like they\\'re made for me! nice price too! great product, very comfortable. i love that i could cut to fit the length of my legs. i am only 5\\' tall, so finding a palazzo pant to fit is very difficult. i love these. my only complaint is that the shorts fabric is black but the stitching is white, so it looks pretty obvious when they\\'re on. otherwise they fit as expected and are pretty cute. perfect. im 5\\'3&#34;, 115 pounds. they fit perfect but theres a lot of stretchiness in the waist band, and someone taller could definitely pull them off too. so cute i have actually ordered other pants styles from woman within and while i don\\'t hate them, they were never quite what i was hoping for. this particular style is exactly what i was hoping for - the sewn-in seam, the narrower leg, the nice waist-to-crotch length that i\\'m used to. i\\'ve had other pants that were so long from waist to crotch that i felt like i had to pull them way up or have the crotch way below where it should be. i\\'m short-waisted, so my torso is not as long as some and i carry my weight around my tummy, not my hips or legs. that said, these pants are not tight in the hips or thighs, so don\\'t worry that they wouldn\\'t fit you. it\\'s just that they are not baggy as many other styles are. if you are a shorter-waisted gal, or tend to have tummy vs. hips, these will flatter you. love these palazzo pants. just as they are described.<br />i an usually a perfect size 16 w i wish i had ordered a size up.they fit, but snug.<br />material is good quality. very happy! next time, i will order the 2x otherwise great. i like it.  comfy. fit well and nice stretch  very soft.  love the color. i got the mint color & the color is exactly like the photo. they are comfortable, stretchy around the leg & but area for a nice fit, & overall exactly what i wanted & was hoping for! also, i placed this order on july 5th, the estimate delivery date was july 10th, but i received it today- july 7th.. in just 2 days! i am so incredibly happy with the speedy delivery. not particularly stylish, but they do get the job done. these leggings are true to size, fit wonderfully and i have received quite a few compliments.  the can be dressy and casual, boots or heels.  love these. so worth the price!! awesome! love it!! for once, i didn\\'t have to hem my pants! i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; and weigh 170 and my legs are somewhat short. i ordered petite large and the fit is perfect. these pants are very slimming. they are well made and very comfortable. i would order them again. i was hoping these would be longer. i\\'m pretty tall and can never find lounge pants that don\\'t look like high waters. no success if you have long legs :/ fit as expected and so comfortable. love them!! classy fit very well the pants are super comfy and have a great fit. i would have liked them shorter but all of my pants fit that way. they are really flattering and are warm. great yoga pants! exactly as described. after a workout i had no issues with sweat sticking to me. these really kept the moisture off my skin and there was no lingering workout odor after. they dried quickly and didn\\'t shrink. there is a nice wide waistband and don\\'t squeeze my legs or ride up. i am 5.8&#34; and have a 28 waist. the small fits me perfectly! also, was packaged very nicely in a plastic zipper bag... so you could easily give these as a gift too. it\\'s just what i ordered.  always a durable product with lots of pockets and room. very nice and very comfortable. fits perfectly. i was expecting it to be the absolute softness, according to some of the reviews. its not cloudy-softness, but its a very nice feeling anyway. thank you for shipping so quickly!!  i am leaving for my next assignment in north dakota as a travel nurse in a few days!<br /><br />should be a fun assignment and they have no problem with a nurse wearing capri pants.  i asked, just in case.<br /><br />will get a few more down the road.<br /><br />thank you again.  barb good quality great pants that fit a little bit large (especially in the butt and calf regions) but are otherwise good. quality of materials seems good and they are quite comfortable. love them fit great and super comfortable love this!! i\\'m a size 30&#34; waist so i got an xl and it fits perfect. just what i specified in my purchase, and the size, very comfortable, arrived at the required time, if required to make a purchase of this type of article this is the place. love the softness....fits a little baggy but it is a sweatsuit perfect for lounging. fit nicely and are long although a bit larger than my need but the quality is perfect, & i like the texture. great excellent pants. i will be buying more colors. love these. perfect for hiking, etc. outside. they dry in a snap! extra wide waistband is so comfortable and all the cargo pockets are great. i have 5 pairs of the \\'pants to capri\\' in different colors and a couple pair of the shorts ,too! just too long in the legs for a petite person. material wahes well and is very comfortable. recommended as a good buy. so cute love these pants!  the colors are beautiful and earthy, they are super comfy, and i can move in all directions with them, which means i can wear them to yoga. i\\'m a size 10, have a ample booty and these look good on me.  if your belly is a little flabby it will be accentuated when these are worn as pants, rather than a romper.  i\\'ve toned mine up since getting these so it looks much better now.  i get lots of compliments when wearing these.  i\\'d give them 5 stars if the pants were more affordably priced. good . great product and shipped quickly! cool these pants are very durable, well made, comfortable and stretchy. i am 5\\'6, 140 lbs, i also have a decent sized butt so i ordered the large, and they fit perfect except for the fact they were long. i didnt care though, i folded them under and they look fine! i would buy them again i got these pants in the middle of the expected time so that\\'s good.<br />they\\'re a legging like material so they\\'re sorta thin. i\\'m a 5 ft 6 and my pant size is 2-4 and they fit fairly well.<br />and as for the swastika symbol people keep talking about it looks like this (i took a pic of it) and it\\'s not like the one the nazi\\'s used. it\\'s the version that medical people in some asian country used to use if i remember right and had no harmful meaning like it does now. too long, had to have it tailored. when i first received these pants, i thought they looked kind of &#34;flimsy&#34;, but i could not have been more wrong! they are soft, thin and extremely comfy. i wore them throughout my pregnancy. the top part stretched out quite a bit, so i thought they would be ruined, but after i had my baby, i still wear them and they fit just fine! the material still holds up very well and surprisingly, the pants fit perfectly even after i lost the belly!  very satisfied. i love these pants. they have a jeggings feel and pick up hair and lint fairly easily. but you can\\'t beat the price actually fitted well. good length like it a lot these are super cute and stylish and my 13 year old loves them.  there is not a bit of cotton though so they get uncomfortable if it is too warm. leggings are nice, but not what i would consider &#34;compression.&#34; just normal leggings. seams seem strong enough, but the fabric is just average quality. interesting/fun design with contrast striping at bottom of legs; however, the seam that joins the two fabrics is a little awkward when nowadays we are spoiled with seamless leggings. the two fabrics are slightly different in texture/quality; both feel similar to swimsuit material. i would keep them but i like the other leggings i ordered much better (90 degree by reflex = awesome). sizing was as expected per the manufacturers guidelines. i had to wiggle into them, but they were flexible, comfortable, and opaque once in place. can\\'t attest to their performance under heavy use as i only wore them for 10 minutes before deciding to return. they seemed like they would stay up for a run or yoga though. i have a pair of these that i wear to yoga classes. the material is soft and stretchy making them very comfortable, however there is enough support in the fabric and waistband so that they stay put through all the poses that you encounter in yoga class. the waistband is well-designed; it has elastic but it lays flat.  the capri length is perfect as well since it is long enough to provide coverage and warmth yet not get in the way when you are changing positions.  the colour combination is also nice. good scrubs.<br />i went through a number of different brands before coming across these.<br />fit is good as well as comfortable. the 55 cotton/35 polyester is the right mix for comfort. the woman of the home loves them and i think they look great on her.  she will probably get more. great starter pair of bike shorts. love love looovveeee these scrub pants they fit absolutely perfect and are so comfortable and they look cute and have awesome colors!! i have now bought 3 pairs and am slowly making my entire wardobe of scrubs this brand. nice pants. they look great and they are very comfortable, the fabric feels soft and light, i love them. i will get another pair soon. perfect fit, nice quality. very comfortable great pants.  great fit.  comfortable and stylish. these pants are so so cute i love them !! i was a bit worried about buying these because i\\'m short... (5\\'2&#34; on a good day).  they are great and fit perfectly.  i walk 4+ miles a day and prefer to wear a yoga pant and tank.  these were perfect.  i weigh 125 and got the small and they were a perfect fit!  they have held up many washes and have not pilled like others have said.  i\\'ve bought 5 pair now (to get me through a week).  they are very comfortable and i would wear them every day if i could.  they aren\\'t super tight so you could even wear them out and about.  i love them and the price is awesome!  i definitely recommend these! i am 5\\'9&#34; and weigh 160. after reading the reviews, i was pretty nervous about the size. however, they fit me like they were tailor made!! i absolutely love them and just ordered another pair in a different color. i let the pants hang to air dry after washing and didn\\'t notice any shrinkage. the fabric isn\\'t top quality but for the price, these pants rock!! 5\\'4&#34; 100 lbs. ordered xs top and xs bottom. they look like the picture and fit me well in length and size. but i do have to struggle a little to take the top off if i don\\'t want to smear my makeup all over the neckline. and i have noticed few loose threads inside the pockets and around the hemlines. overall, the product is as expected. i got the tall size one. it is a little bit too long. it looks great now after i shortened the legs a little. love them and they are very comfy actually - better than expected...i love the pants.  i\\'m short, 5\\'2&#34;  and these fit perfectly! the fit is great and i really like the fabric recipient of gift loves it they are cut small so i would get a larger size than you wear.  i love the look of them so i am going on a diet to lose the weight to fit in them better. love love love these! cheaper material but you get what you pay for..  a helpful tip though- use hair spray on these when you wear them. the material is similar to nylon panty hose and can easily run. the hair spray halts this from happening. the appearance and color of this product is spot on and just as depicted nice jeans, a little snug without a lot of stretch. just order up a size maybe? they fit perfectly and are very comfortable for spring the color was as expected and perfectfor going to the gym. our model love this product thanks will keep on shopping with you 😃 perfect transaction and communication. i tried the medium plus size and fits good but reorder a size l because i wanted to wear longjohn\\'s underneath and i find there is not much of a difference. i am an equestrian and i love the pants they have lots of stretch in it. i ordered a third pair as a gift and share your page to my equestrian friends. just to let you know i\\'m 5&#34;2 and weighted 135 pound :) first of all i actually like these pants. there are actually two styles - pull-on style with wide waistband for folding over and a zip-up with drawstring style. i ordered one of each. and i ordered up a size because of all the reviews saying they ran small. i usually wear an 8-10 which is a medium, so i ordered a large and bought two pairs. one pair was the mocha pull-on style, the other was in black with the zip-up drawstring style. the mocha pull-on style is actually a tad bit too loose, but i can make it work and i love the look. the zip up style with drawstring fit perfectly - so it was good i ordered the large in that style.  i guess the bottom line is that the drawstring style does run a full size smaller - so order a size up. the pull-on style runs more true to size so i would recommend ordering your regular size in that style. little pricey but good quality and super comfortable. i wish it was a little cheaper but happy with purchase so far when i was ordering, the ad said &#34;runs small, order one size larger&#34;.  i wear between a size 14-16 in clothing, so i figured i better buy a larger size.  i ended up buying an xl and an xxl just in case.  the extra large fit just fine, so there was no need for me to buy the xxl.  so i would tell future buyers to buy what size they normally do and ignore the \\'runs small\\' quote. just purchased a second and third pair as requested from my wife. she loves them for zumba or relaxing. she\\'s 5\\'4&#34;, 120lbs. they fit nice, a tad long but it\\'s no bother. bought her a size m because she doesn\\'t like to be stuffed in them &#34;like a sausage.&#34;  (her words, not mine).  fast shipping! wonderful! i miscalculated my size! but it fits for the most part! i\\'m working out and losing weight so it will fit perfectly as soon as possible!! i\\'m happy with my purchase! these pants make me feel great! this product is really nice. they are cozy and have pockets too! these were made well. i got them in white and they fit really good. the have elastic so they will fit a range of sizes. i\\'m really happy with these. it is very nice but little longer for me i am 5.5&#34; perfect work pants! soo soft:) runs a little small. im typically a medium and i got a large and they fit great these are the best pants ever i\\'m ordering the grey ones too. they are a light almost t shirt material and are so flowy and so comfy cozy. i want a pair for eachday. only draw back is i keep having to pull them up no tie or elastic so as the day goes by they get stretched out and slip down they should cone in extra small. other than that i wish they had more colors love the material. i am a size large but ordered an xl for a loose fit...but it is not loose at all.  i am going to keep them and just make sure to wear a longer shirt. in different colors its nice perfect as to size, color, look and feel.  when i do not want to look too shabby, these are the &#34;go to&#34;.  easy for the day and can get into the night as well with a change of tops and shoes. i read and reread the reviews for these pants.  i couldn\\'t figure out why some were so good and some were so bad.<br /><br />about me: i am 5\\'1&#34; average build. but a slightly short inseam only 28&#34;<br /><br />here\\'s what i learned:<br />i ordered 5 pairs of large pants 2 black,  1 navy, 1 light grey and 1 tan. i bought these pants for a comfortable office option because i just had surgery and won\\'t be able to wear jeans for a while.<br /><br />the two black pants are made from a very thin material (you definitely need black underwear) however the inseam is perfect length and they fit comfortably not too tight or loose.<br /><br />the three colored pairs are made from a much higher quality material but are way too long.<br /><br />i love the pants and how comfortable they are so i cut between 2 and 3 inches off the bottom of each pair of colored pants and now i can wear them all with flats and flip flops without dragging the ground.<br /><br />i love these pants even the black ones are a good quality for the price your paying. i would recommended them but know if your short you may need them alerted or trim them yourself for anything other then black. i haven\\'t worn cords since i was a kid, which was a long time ago.  these are wonderful and fit well.  perfect for any season. havent stopped wearing them! i love the rust color. im a size 2 to 4 jeans and i bought a medium. im 5\\'7 and they fit perfectly. i couldve worn a small though. i recommend. great pants! good fit,and so comfortable! i would live in these if i could! great for casual run around days, and with the right shoes,etc, could very easily be dressed up. i had this since 2009, and this year 2014 i bought new one fit is very flattering. can be dressed up or down, soft and comfortable. exceeded expectations. size 11 was true to size and enough stretch to mask problem areas. feels as though you have nothing on, very comfortable. cute these are so cute. not thin like leggins but not thick like jeans, which is exactly what i wanted for summer.  the fit isnt low waisted which i was hoping not, and so glad, because im not a teen anymore😂. no muffin top! color is truly red, great fit even on us that have more hip and thigh. can be tight if calves are thicker, but the stretch helps. as a plus size gal, finding the perfect leggings isn\\'t an easy task.  many are too sheer and offer no support, and are basically a pair of tights.  i received this pair of leggings to review and i am extremely impressed with them.  i ordered the 18/20 and it fits perfectly.  the fabric is thick and offers control and support, you don\\'t have to worry about wearing a long shirt or dress over top.  this is definitely a high quality pair of leggings and are make the perfect pair of work pants for my office job.  i am in love with them, they are so comfortable and i feel covered when wearing them! love these! i love the pants.. they are super sun and comfy.  i am adult l and the waist is small for a osfa.  ankle too.  but overall really fun pant.  wish there were others like them... i would order them. i was standing in line at a starbucks when i saw a woman ahead of me wearing one of these. she looked so cute. i decided to search amazon and found this. i am 5\\'8.5&#34; 135lbs and i got the red in medium. very comfortable and looks so unique. the length is long but it works for me at my height. getting a small for my daughter, but will see it that\\'s too tight for me since i\\'d like the legs a little less wide, but hope she\\'ll wear it since she\\'s so sporty. so beautiful! nice fit and feel at first i ordered size xl, but they were just a little too snug, accentuating my flab. so i exchanged them for 2x and was very pleased with the results. these pants are incredibly comfortable and attractive, so i ordered them in several colors. by the way, the colors are phenomenal! i figure if i loose some weight, they will still fit and look good, only better. awesome fast shipping product was as described i want another one. is perfect! love\\'em. hope you get more colors in my size in stock. came before expected. great. i love these! they look better than they are pictured, and they fit great. very comfortable, however the legs feel much looser than the waistband. love these! these hot pants are true to the picture shown. they are a metallic \\\\\\\\\"wonder woman\\\\\\\\\" blue. they are a little cheeky, so definitely not appropriate for a conservative event but great for nightclubs or a costume. i found the sizing to be on the small size; since i am a size 25/26 in jeans i ordered a small and found it to be a bit tight. however it is quite stretchy. one thing i noticed is that after one night of clubbing, the metallic outer layer started to wear away in certain places, i assume either from sweat/heat (they are quite hot due to the polyester fabric) or friction from dancing. i anticipate that after a few more wears and washes the fabric will become quite weak. i will probably not repurchase due to the lower quality, however they are fun for special occasions or holidays. just like the picture! very comfortable bottoms. i am a curvy size 16 and was initially skeptical about the purchase. a lot of the time the sizing is specific to asian women, who are naturally petite (and xxl would equate to size 8 american size). i ordered these in a 1x and they fit great! the fabric is soft and feels great on the legs. much elasticity! superb quality. i used the tulip one step tie die kit, to personalize them. i like them but they are really small. new they would be tight, like all yoga pants, but they are really really tight. so tight that they are see through and i even got a large. they fit smaller so order size bigger. perfect fit and i cannot say how much i love these! they loosen a touch as you wear them, but hold true to shape. so comfortable and cute! these are soft and very comfortable.  i\\'m 5\\' 9&#34; and the length is fine.  so glad that i finally found a pair that fit. read the reviews, but still was very interested in trying them.  the fit is good, a little snug around the thighs, but i am used to that in most of my pants with the way my body is built. i normally wear a size 8/10 and i got these in large size.  i am only 5\\'5&#34; so the length is perfect and sits nicely with 3&#34; heels.  the material is comfortable and seems to be the wash and wear type (i am yet to run it through laundry).  i did receive my pants at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. nice pants, good quality.  top is just not as tight as i\\'d prefer it to be.  it\\'s very loose and i have to keep pulling them up.  probably should have ordered a size smaller. this is the second pair i have bought of these. firstly you cannot beat this price. secondly my first pair is still hanging in there strong a year later. i will continue to purchase this brand. comfortable and durable. the other nice thing is that it is easy to brush cat hair off of these leggings unlike some other materials. nice pants comfortable and chic these are really comfortable! i really enjoy them :) very nice pants. these leggings are so comfortable and hold their shape beautiful. fit perfectly. not too thin either. color is true to what the picture shows. love these! super comfy. can wear for pjs or to run errands :) let me first say that this is the first time i ever bought clothing from amazon and boy was i surprise they came within 4 business<br />days and they fit great.. love them and recommend them perfect !!!!!!!!  my measurements are 36c 28 39.  i weigh 155 pounds.  i am 5ft. 8 in. tall. i ordered a medium. i really really like them, but they are a bit big, and they tend to stretch out a bit while wearing them due to different sitting positions and moving about.<br /><br />waist: 22.5&#34;<br />hips: 32&#34;<br />largest part of thigh: 17.5&#34;<br />mid-thigh: 14.5&#34;<br />height: 5\\'0&#34;<br /><br />they get a bit loose around the ankles, thighs, and knees while also being about 2 inches too long for me. but, i like them anyway :) great !! perfect for the price i was expecting the typical thin, snug material. but was pleasantly surprised to find them nice thick quality with no fear of them being see through i am really liking these leggings.  they are holding up well after multiple wears and washings.  i was a little worried about the one size fits all, given i am short and a little on the plus size, but no worries they fit well.  i am also an amputee and wear a prosthesis on my right leg.  i was worried about the knee area becoming worn with the edge of the prosthesis constantly rubbing that area.  so far, so good.  the fleece lining keeps me warm also. love love love!! see through i like the fit overall. i wish they elastic was tighter. which i would get with a smaller size. but i didn\\'t want to have the pants too tight on my thighs and posterior. very happy with the quality and fit! cute shorts perfect for the beach!<br />buy 1 size up if you have a bigger butt the most comfortabel pajamas i have ever worn. lovely colour and pleased with my purchase-cheers l i love love love these....they fit perfect....everyone compliments me on how gorgeous they are...excellent seller and fast shipping.......thank you so much.. im getting these on every color!! they are super soft and comfy and warm.. well as warm as leggings can get... if you are somewhere below freezing you need a snowsuit so dont ask for miracles from these legging but they are great! i bought a second pair, these are great! the shorts are adorable and the seller is very nice. shorts fit well and look great. fit as expected. i absolutely love these pants. love love love these, but they were a bit longer than expected. i ordered<br />2luv women\\'s high waisted circle prints palazzo same size and the length was more my fit. have had tons of compliments on these and would reccomend them to anyone! awesome item these pants are super cute, can\\'t stop wearing them. they look just like picture. love love u should buy. :3 these are closer to a long capri than a full length pant. i would love if they were longer i love my chinese pajamas.  i wore them for halloween<br />as part of my costume & since they are purple i am wearing<br />them to a red hat sleep party.  they are really comfortable,<br />but since the material dosen\\'t stretch i would recommend<br />buying the next size. the shitz i received these in the mail today from the company rabbit rachel. i received this item in under 2 weeks from china. i have to say these are very unique looking leggings. i am 5\\'8, and i was worried that they would be too short, and they were long enough to fit me. the black portion of the pants, feels like an average pair of leggings material. i love the straps criss-crossing down the legs in the front. the back of the leggings aren\\'t that way at all. the mesh portions of the leggings are more like pantyhose material, it didnt tear or anything when i tried them on. they are very comfortable leggings to wear, and they would look best with a long black sweater or tshirt. i would advise you to either hand wash, or wash these leggings in cold water. if you are looking for an edgy or rocker style, you should definitely buy these, they are at a great price. these capris are extremely versatile.  they can be worn with almost anything- from a tank top to a swimsuit and have the person wearing them looking great!  they are cute and comfy for a great price! i love these pants! i was pleasantly surprised to see that the fabric looks and feels so much more expensive than what they cost! the fit is great too. i got all my friends hooked on these! tight are perfect to workout in. love the texture because it isn\\'t transparent (: defentely recommend them they fit my wife great and are comfortable. i love these leggings! they are made very well. i\\'m a size 8 5\\'4&#34; 160..and i have big thighs and ordered a large. they fit perfect! i wanted to order the white but they don\\'t have then in a large. they really do look rich! i usually wear a 3 in pants, and this fit a bit snug, but it works for me! not much stretch to it, so if you are between a small and a medium or anything above that, i wouldn\\'t purchase this.<br />look exactly like in the picture! :) very cool artwork -<br />colors are vibrant - pictures are cleared - can\\'t wait to wear them~<br />thank you~ i love these...i just walk out in them and get compliments! be warned these are really long! like 37 inch inseam long...i used my rotary cutter and cut off about 2 inches at the end and still could trim 1/2 an inch or so. i typically run about 33 on the inseam, so was happy to have the extra length, but feel they could have been shorter. i should have gone for a medium or small but wasn\\'t sure if this was juniors\\' or womens\\' sizing. i am 5\\'7 and 133 lbs. these leggings though a bit small are great. as leggings usually run to the smaller end of a size this was not an issue. they look great and i get nothing but compliments when wearing them. cute fit but still stays on good when wakeboard or doing active stuff in the water don\\'t really stretch once in the water. which is good looked really small when i took them out of the package, but fit well. bending over does stretch material enough to make it a bit see-through, but i love them. very comfy, breathable, will be purchasing more. only wish they had more colors. the pants are a little short. but otherwise they fit great. i should have just ordered a medium.  these were much larger than i anticipated.  i\\'ll gift them to someone else. i initially found these pants at nordstroms and was elated when i found them on amazon. these are the only skinny pants that are flattering for my body type - i have an athletic frame with large calves, muscular thighs, and a smaller waist. most skinny pants i can\\'t even get past my calves they are so tight. the mia slim roll twill and denim pants do not shrink if you put them in the dryer and run a bit large due to the stretch-fabric blend. i would order down if you like you pants tight, i don\\'t so i ordered my typical pant size. they are super comfortable and i now own 5 pairs. these are a great mid-rise casual pant that can be paired with heels, sneakers, sandals, or flats. these are definitly hot!!.....i wear these in az teaching pe. i  am going to wear them two days a week. i am only 5 foot and they come just above my knee....i wish they were a tiny bit shorter but its fine. i will weight myself at end of month to see how much weight lost....if any! so comfy! everyone kept asking me all day where i bought them! amazing pant, especially for the price! i\\'m normally a size 25 and the small was perfect. surprised to find that after washing it requires ironing, not a good thing! i love it i wasn\\'t sure whether i was going to get a sort of dark christmas green or a more olive green, based on the photos of the dark green pants and a dark green shirts. the shirts were more olive colored. i wish actually hoping for the olive green but what came was pretty much what is pictured for the pants.<br /><br />being that they are listed as unisex i chose a medium and they fit perfectly. i do wish they had elastic around the ankles. they\\'re just a tad long but i am 5\\'4\\\\\\\\\" so i\\'m not surprised. they are utterly and completely the most comfortable pants i own. just ordered another pair. beautiful fabric these are my new favorite pants. they fit perfectly on my size 12 frame. they are comfortable and stylish and i have already received compliments on them. these fit great, are really cute, and are made well. i wanted something different and these fit the bill. very comfortable. i am a size 8 and they fit perfect. love them! fit well and very cute it fitted ok perfect on the legs, but the<br />waist was big on my stomach, i am 128 lbs and 5\\'4 live it. was delivered on time! not what i expected, was too small. but i still like them. packaging was great no wrinkles love these yoga pants!  they are actually long enough for me and look great on.  i can actually do yoga in them (i know, a novel idea), or throw on a dressy top and be ready for a night out.  loved them so much, i bought another pair. i love it =) love these harem pants, very good quality also pros- i like these pants.  i love the quality of material. i feel like peace and love when i wear them.  they go with my whole natural flow.  the material is nice and silky.  i love the fold down option. cons- the only problem as others have noted, is the pants are too long.  i understand that they are maybe trying to compensate for every possible height but, they should have included a needle and thread or stitch witchery .  thank god i sew. overall i give these pants 4 stars. very comfortable very nice i am 5 4 120 pds and got a small and it fit me just right great quality material and well constructed... super cute! i am 5\\'9, length it too short but the pants are very soft and would be comfy otherwise. wish i didnt have to return them. excellent comfort theses are very well made little snug in the thigh, but that was as suspected. they loosen up with wear. these have a very nice thick linen and are not even a little bit see through! i would suggest these pants to anyone intrested in a nice light pant for a tropical vacation super soft and comfortable, and i usually hate wearing sweats or yoga pants. will definitely seek this brand again. love these pants love these capris by memoi. fit is perfect, really comfortable. can\\'t wait to order another color. love the fit i realized too late that i had made an error in judgement. normally i meticulously pick through all of the reviews on an item and seller before purchasing. however i was hasty with these, and did a 1 click order. a day or two later when i was checking on the status i started skimming the reviews and found myself quite worried that i was going to get a pretty shady pair of pants. but to my delight, no holes, no tears, perfect fit. they didn\\'t run large, they didn\\'t run small. i think we all just seem to have different opinions on our own sizes, and different brands are always a risk as to what kind of fit they will be for our own bodies. however these are great. the fold over top is the best part, it\\'s super super soft, almost silky. i adore these and plan to order more in the different patterns. (fingers crossed those don\\'t turn out like the other reviews.) unlike most clothing i\\'ve ordered, this actually runs on the big size. but very comfortable. more designed like maternity pants. elastic waist is several inches just like maternity pants. on the plus side it makes them quite comfortable ok these leggings do the trick in smoothing out a few unwanted curves. i only wish they were offered in a petite length. i need to hem them but it will be worth the effort. very comfortable. great pants. love it!!! i absolutely love these pants. they are very comfortable, yet light weight enough that they do not make you feel hot. i liked them enough that i ordered more in different colors. these are perfect for my 30th birthday party costume cute cut, nice fabric, but runs a little small. had to return for larger size. i got these to run a super hero 5k - fit was fine, stayed on for 3 miles and were actually quite warm. i agree with the posts i read about the pants before i bought, buy a size smaller. i could wear this every day, wish they had a pocket in the front, but no complaints! love these yoga pants fits, they are awsome, does not stretch out as soon as you wear them enough spandex to keep them snug i bought these for a  70\\'s party and they were perfect. very comfortable !!! i vacillated for weeks about getting these pants.  as a full figured 6 ft 2 inch woman, finding pants that are flattering is a challenge to say the least.  it\\'s always a crap shoot buying clothes online but when the price came down,i figured i would give it a shot.  so glad that i did.  these pants are so cute!  they hit me right at my ankle, so i will be rocking these with a cute tank or tee and some fly sandals.  the vertical striping is also flattering.<br /><br />at 15 bucks, these are a steal.  go for it! these pants are just wonderful! very true to size! i were 18/20, and these are a perfect fit! the fabric is great for winter. and the length is perfect for me at 5\\'11&#34; and well as my mother at 5\\'6&#34;.<br />the  quality is wonderful! they are similar to tights, but the fabric keeps the pants from showing off all your dimples!<br />the fit is great too. they are wonderfully designed. they won\\'t cut you off in the middle. they are pretty high waisted, which i love!  no showing of your behind when you bend over! i love these pants! they are like a jean material. i am usually a size xs in motherhood maternity/a pea in the pod pants, so i went with the xs in these as well. they\\'re a perfect fit and they look cute on! i\\'d recommend them for any pregnant woman wanting a cute addition to her maternity wardrobe :) i am 5\\' 10&#34; and roughly 130 lbs. the jumpsuit is a little above my ankles, but i think it looks really cute that way! the fabric is very breathable and i love it! nice and flowy for those fat days!!!! i finally decided to take the plunge and buy some nmdj and though they do fit well and the fabric and workmanship are good, i\\'m not sure they are worth the hefty price.  the particular fit (small waist, ample bum), which can be frustrating to find, is equally served for much less by either land\\'s end or gloria vanderbilt.<br /><br />the good news is i do now have a well fitting, well made, comfortable pair of new jeans. .....not sure i\\'ll come back for a second pair however...... extremely comfortable! these were not supposed to get here until june! i ordered it on april 24,i received it yesterday may6. i read how it ran small,so i ordered a 2xl. it\\'s a bit too big in the waist,so i just cinched it in a little. the rest though fits great! i don\\'t like my shorts butt cheek short or skin tight. they are short but well below being inappropriate. for example there is a customer pic, she has the pink shorts on. mine don\\'t fit like that. they are much more loose and much longer in the back. (btw the picture helped out a lot,thanx)<br />so these shorts are pretty good for the price,there were a couple of loose threads but nothing ridiculous. i got the blue ones and the color is acurate,its very vibrant.definitely order up though.i am 5\\'3&#34;, i wear between a 5/7,athletic build, proportionate,so nothing is particularly bigger. consider you own build,how you like your clothes to fit. i did get the xxl and had to take in the waist but my legs and butt are not suffocating! all in all, i love these shorts and the color is lovely. i would buy these again. perfect fit! very comfortable! the pant legs are a little long, not much sorter then the equivalent men\\'s pants, but they are super comfortable! i read the reviews so i got the appropriate size bigger and it works great! i love the pants as it fits like a glove but a bit too long for my petite 5\\'4 frame. its super comfy and very sleek i\\'m 5\\'3, 130 pounds, so for one size, i will say they are a little tight in the waist, but they could be a lot worse! most one size fits all are either too tight or too big, so these aren\\'t bad. the length is perfect, great with flats or heels, or lounging around the house, or even working out in. the fabrithe stretch in the fabric may show through to your skin at places where you bend or are larger but it\\'s not too bad that i noticed or felt uncomfortable. overall i love them, can\\'t wait to get more. i\\'ve been looking for pants like these forever. i had a similar pair but they were in desperate need of being replaced. then i found these. though i didn\\'t know they were &#34;plus size sweats&#34; until i got this email to review them. i\\'m a size 10, hardly a plus. the &#34;medium&#34; fits great. i wear them around the house when i want to relax and be comfortable. good for those cool mornings or evenings when i go walking, too. i would definitely recommend these. great fit great gift presnted to my wife for christmas even though we had to almost return due to size difference between the u.s. and china. very soft and good material. slightly large so i wouldn\\'t mind another pair in a smaller size. very cute and comfortable! i ordered my regular size and they were to small. they are still cute and look comfortable. maybe i will fit in them one day.. came back and ordered more colors. fit was good. fabric is stretchy. i love these pants they fit just the way i wanted them to roomy. most of all they are so soft and feel nice. these fit very nicely. i ordered a large and they seem like they were made perfectly for my dimensions (5\\'10\\'\\', 170 lbs, 42 1/2 \\'\\' hip). however, i will also be ordering a pair one size larger in case these shrink in the wash. love them, they arrived fast, the color is very beautiful yellow, not too thick, the textile looks interesting, in between faux leather and rain clothing textile, they fit very well. i like them, but the &#34;fold over waist&#34; does not look like the picture at all. a bit on the large side, and a magnet for cat hair. these are very comfy. they kind of remind me of maternity pants, but they are way cooler. i love these and will definitely purchase other colors!! bought these to be alladin for halloween. perfect price and fit. so awesome! they came super early! they fit well too, i\\'m usually a small/medium but i order a large and it works out great! definetly would buy again loe this brand! nice i loved them but they were too small. had to return them. these pants are so comfortble and can be paired with tanks, tees and even tub tops.  great for yoga and excersize as well. especially if you like wide leg pants and i do....  colors are great and accurate; length is perfect; material is medium weight and has a silky feel;  fit is as expected and the price cannot be beat.  seller is fast and reliable.  love this pant... i absolutley love these and have ordered several pair. ive had them probably 2 months and i wear them all the time and they are still holding up great through all the washes love these! i originally ordered up a size as was suggested. too big. so i ordered my regular size m. fits well. felt good riding in them. great flowing pant. this is my 2nd pair. i\\'m a bit short so i had to adjust the length but for the price i did not mind. fits great!  live these pants. even though they are too small doesn\\'t mean that they are not a nice pair of pants. they are to long also but i could probably take them up in the future. these pants are reasonably priced and very cute! be advised, there are slits entirely up the sides (which you can\\'t really see on the ad). one great thing is that they should fit most people who are a size 14-16, as well as fitting smaller sizes, because they stretch well. if you\\'re short, like me (5\\'3&#34;), these will drag the ground about 2-3 inches behind you. they\\'re made for people of average height. my one complaint are the clear stones that separate the splits on the sides of the pants. they are big, and to me look cheap and gaudy. smaller stones would look better, in my opinion. overall, i am happy with my purchase and would recommend these to anyone who has no objections to any of the product details i mentioned. love it, fits perfectly wife loves them very comfortable soft material. i haven\\'t worn them yet because i\\'ll have to have them hemmed. i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; and even with heels these are made for someone that\\'s like 5\\'8&#34;. had to return so many black pants to other stores..glad i found these..they fit perfect.. comfy but a little long. i bought two! very long, but nice and lightweight for summer wear. love this brand!! love these shorts! so cute, wear them all the time! fit was perfect! perfect they run small but it was easy to return and get the next size - they fit great. product was good quality, but not the right size, and material.  the shipping was quick.  had the product fit, i would have kept them. i love it but it is on the small side,i ordered the largest size and it is too small, i am a 14/ 16, so i passd it on to a smaller person...<br />be careful with this company they size asian, not american. i wish they had smaller sizes. they look so wonderful! product arrived three days early but that\\'s no problem. i usually wear size 2 pants in general, so i originally ordered a size 4 (l29) but still was too small. i planned on exchanging for one size up, but then i realized i would want a little bit of breathing room because i\\'d be working outside, so i went with size 8 (xxl). fits exactly the way i want.<br /><br />also, the material on these green ones are lighter than the black ones, which are are heavy duty material. so, green ones are better for warmer days while black ones for colder days.<br /><br />to wear for fashion/fit feel, order one size up from your normal size.<br />to wear as utility or work pants, order two sizes up. i always wish to find pants which are longer, but with this style the length is ok--not great but ok.  i am 5\\' 11&#34; tall though, so that may be purely a personal problem.  color and fabric are great. i ordered a xxxl which was a mistake.  i wanted them to be super roomy, but they were way too big.  for reference, i am 5\\'7 170lbs with a post-baby belly.  i probably should have gone with the xl.  they are very soft and comfortable. great for tall girls like me, i\\'m 5\\'8 and they fit really well, however they do shrink length wise after the first wash which made them quite a bit shorter, but still good for yoga! the thicker material provides an extra layer of warmth in winter. free shipping. really comfortable! came in timely manner. they an almost perfect fit. a little bulky at the hip. well made and good looking. i\\'d give these pants 10 stars if i could the size is what you\\'d expect maybe a little long bit for pajama pants that\\'s what i like. the fabric is so soft. it\\'s t-shirt fabric so not too light but not thick and heavy. i would live in these pants if i could there so comfy. very comfortable, soft fabric, i was concerned about the size but they fit perfectly! im 5\\'4 and about 125lb. must buy! i will definitely be getting more of these. love it the leggins are great they did run a bit big but they wash great and wrinkle free and do not loose color after  washes<br />this is a must have for go to sportswear or workwear after reading other reviews, i decided to order a size up which was the right move. when i got them and tried them on, i initially thought that i should have gone two sizes up, but after wearing them for a bit, they stretched out just where i needed them to and looked great. really comfortable! im absolutely in love with these pants! they\\'re soft, comfy to wear & true to color. i was scared at first that they weren\\'t going to fit because most of the reviews were smaller sized, however, being 5\\'8&#34; and 140 lbs they fit just perfect! they are gorgy!!! i\\'ve gotten so many complements from these pants and asking where i got them from. i threw on a teal blue crop top to set off the very small shade of teal blue in the design. i will definitely buy their other harem pants. so cute and sassy :-) the fit is exactly what i like -loose and flowing around the legs. just don\\'t care for the tie in the front (i tuck them under the the garter and that solves the problem). i have almost all the colors except would like it in brown which is not available. shiitake color may be my next purchase. the material is good quality which i only wash in cold water and hang dry-i live in palazzo pants all the time because they can be dressed up or casual--they\\'re pretty versatile and flattering on a curvy figure. i\\'m giving these five stars for the money. at less than $10 for these (shipping included), i was pleasantly surprised by the quality. if i had paid $20 for them, i probably would have given 3 or 4 stars. the pants are just cotton and polyester. perhaps there is a bit of variation on what you get based on what the other reviewer said, but i am 5\\'7&#34;, 135 pounds with disproportionately long legs and found the length to be good. i got the pants in wine red and the color was as expected. i was also pleased that they were not terribly thin. they are stretchy leggings, but they are not see through at all. perfect i\\'m in love with these joggers! going to order them in black now ,also. they are really a bit  too big but the way they drape and &#34;flow&#34; when i walk made it unnecessary to exchange for smaller size-and because they have elastic at the bottom you can have the exact length you want. i buy almost all my wardrobe online-and most of it at amazon.com because of outstanding customer service ,and prices are almost always lower than any other store there is an adorable vest in this moss/black combination by g by guess-so i plan on buying a vest and wearing also a great lightweight print short jacket ,and some booties . cute! i\\'m a 61 year old grandmother and schoolteacher  and this is an &#34;ageless&#34; outfit! fit like a dream very comfy. these pants are absolutely wonderful, minus a couple of things.  here are the issues:<br /><br />1) the sizing chart is somewhat inaccurate.  i wear a juniors size 9 typically, or a women size 8.  i ordered a size medium.  while i was able to button them, it was tough.  it was just too small in the waist, and the pant length was a tad to short.  it caused the &#34;its one size too small muffin top&#34; making it rather uncomfortable to bend or sit.<br /><br />2) they are labeled as dry clean only on the tag, and when i bought them the amazon description said hand wash.<br /><br />also just a general note.  these ship from china directly.  they showed up about a week and a half after i ordered them which was awesome, but that is why the shipping is so much,<br /><br />seller note:  the seller is awesome.  i contacted them via amazon about the sizing issue and they got back to me right away requesting measurements to make sure they get the right size if i was interested in getting some larger ones.<br /><br />i would definitely get these again, and i would definitely order from this seller again.  just be careful of the sizing! the only issue i have with this item is that you do have to be careful as it snags relatively easy. i luv this new out fit naught it to go out. but its so cozy i would wear it n e were these fit as expected and are suuuuper comfortable.  i\\'m kind of tall so i was worried about the length in the medium but they are the perfect length. washing them did not change the fit at all. very satisfied. these pants are perfect for just about anything you need to do from running around town or just lounging around the house. i absolutely love rompers/overalls/jumpsuits since i was a kid. back then, i used to wear them a lot but they went out of fashion when i grew up. so glad, i can rock this look again. it looks trendy yet adorable! the material of this overall is really comfortable to be worn for long periods of time. if you are around 5\\'2&#34;-4&#34; this is a perfect length for you. there are no zippers on buttons on this. it has a really simple design but it looks really cute. you can wear it with different crop tops or t shirts and mix and match the colors. for a more trendy look try these with heels, but you can also wear sneakers with it. it has pockets as well! and, who doesn\\'t love pockets? the stitching and fabric are strong so i don\\'t have any problem washing these in the washing machine. i am a us size small and i got it in size medium. i totally love it. if you are taller though it may be short for you in the crotch. in any case i would recommend contacting the seller to get help with ordering the right size. i had to contact the seller a couple of times they were so nice and helpful. i totally recommend buying from them.<br />sample provided without any obligations. somewhat large these are cute but for a more casual setting. i will use them for dinner out etc... just received my order of the heather grey pants in small and i\\'m so happy with the quality and fit!!  i was a little worried that the small would be too short (i\\'m 5\\'8 currently 140lbs) but they\\'re perfect!!  i am 2 months pregnant and these will be perfect throughout my pregnancy.  i will definitely be ordering more colors. got what i ordered with no problems. i think this is how i will be ordering scrubs from now on. love all the pockets! this belt is exactly what i was looking for!  getting it threw the belts loops takes a little extra effort but worth it i often redesign clothes i buy.  with these, i took out the elastic from the ankles and hemmed about 1 inch, i\\'m 5\\'3\\'\\' and an extra large in pants.  i wear the elastic part starting a bit above the waist,so the crotch does not hang down.  i\\'ve had complements wearing these.  so many of the \\'harem&#34;/wide leg pants made by this company are ugly.  i don\\'t know what the designer/buyers are thinking.  i bought another pair with a similar pattern, but different colors.  i only wish this was a blend with cotton in it.  rayon, poly, etc. are not a breathable as cotton.  i pay more for the cotton blend. great material good daily wear i wore these for the first time today. they are awesome. very soft and comfortable. i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; and 190lbs, and these fit great. not too snug and they come down to my ankles, and then some. they are completely matte and not shiny at all. so far i love them. i haven\\'t laundered them yet, but if i have any problems with that i will update my review. get these, they\\'re great! the yoga pants were super comfortable! i love it! comfortable and stylish--should probably get a size larger than normal-these are neat!  i knew this from already having a pair of t party pants--i have long legs and small hips but where a large. beautiful color and design.  a little small but doable.  may inspire me to lose a few pounds. fabric is soft and feels good on the skin. apparently i am no longer a large and the pants did not fit so i gave to my granddaughter.  next time i will need to order extra-large. love these pants! the only thing i\\'d change is to remove the useless zipper beside the side pocket. i\\'m a nurse and have purchased many different scrub pants but these by far are my favorite!! i have received many compliments on them... will be purchasing more!! i love the color, the wide leg and the fact that it fit perfectly! i ordered a size higher than what i usually wear. has plenty of pockets for storage and fits at waist. no hind sight.  very comfortable fit and the color is looks like the picture. lovely, light weight, great fit and nice linen-look fabric. they\\'d get 5 stars if there were finished.  weirdly the pockets weren\\'t finished. the inside seams of the pockets weren\\'t sewn. had to sew the seams myself. otherwise, loved these. super cute dresdy leggings my daughter loves her new middle earth leggings.  thanks. love these pants i just put these on for the first time. i\\'ve recently purchased a couple pairs of &#34;normal&#34; khaki shorts and cargo shorts, and these thai fisherman shorts are by far the most comfortable. by far. moving is just easier, especially any type of movement that would normally require &#34;hitching up your pants.&#34; the material is nice, seems very breathable, but it\\'s not too thin. i\\'m 6\\'7&#34; with a 34&#34; waist, and these fit me great. they come down two or three inches below my knees, &#34;messenger&#34; style, which is exactly how i like my shorts to fit. a con would be that they did take longer than i had expected to arrive, i actually forgot about them for a second. another potential issue for some people will be the possibility that you will either be mistaken for a hippy, or a hipster, as they do have a unique look. i live in a little city that has a high population of both though, so i\\'m not going to hesitate to wear them around town, doing errands, etc. i\\'ll blend right in. finally i\\'d just like to say that the demonstration pictures make me feel even taller than normal, they go down to his ankles, and he has them up to his belly button. such versatile clothing! i\\'ll update this review in a month to add my thoughts about how they\\'ve held up. they are very comfortable. i will definitely buy some more sets. they are a little  thin. they\\'re a little pricey but worth it.  it has all these pockets that nurses need and has a flattering fit.  love the expresso color. love this pant. fabric is smooth and very nice. these are by far the best scrub pants i have ever bought!!  i just wish there were more color choices. these pants are amazing! fun, different, and not to mention very comfortable. my only &#34;partial&#34; complaint is i order another in a different and these are much much baggier in the crotch area compared to the others and they were the same size. they still fit perfectly in the legs and elastic in the top is just as fitting. would recommend to others who like trendy comfy alternatives to dresses!  you can dress up or down with this! another pro! hope you buy and enjoy! these fit a touch larger than i thought they would. still, the pattern is pretty, and they\\'re comfy. love these scrubs! super soft and comfortable i\\'ll definitely purchase the other colors! fast delivery. . color was as shown and material is super soft. they run small so i would suggest ordering a size up. easy to stretch and move in it, and like the way it makes me look and feel in it.  wish it was slightly lighter in pink i have a couple of pair of these pajamas, in this material, from lands end.  i do not know why the tops are sold separately....i understand that some people have different sizes in tops and bottoms but i think at least some of the pajama sets should be sold as a set....for example, it can become very difficult by the end of the season to find the matching tops (in terms of color) for these.  (lands end cotton interlock pajama tops: [[asin:b004cudf4w lands\\' end women\\'s regular long sleeve cotton interlock crew sleep top]])<br /><br />the are made of a very nice, very soft material.  not flannel, not fleece. lighter than fleece, and a bit heavier, but not by much, than flannel.  very comfortable for lounging or sleeping.<br /><br />they have an elastic waistband, and also a useable drawstring so the pants can be adjusted to an individual\\'s comfort level. for me, any pants with elastic waistbands should have useable, not just decorative, draw strings!<br /><br />highly recommended! i purchased the l6 i weigh 120 and this fit me a slightly too big but i will be keeping them as they were very comfortable and sturdy for hiking. my daughter wears these prscticslly every day! she loves them! my tween daughter uses them in gym class.  she said they are very comfortable.  she likes how they stretch and she loves the leopard print. excellent quality, great price and fast shipping.  fits true to size. this outfit is wonderful. you can put a tank top under the outfit and use it as a more conservative dress suit. it also can be worn to look sexy. i love the way it also hides that pudge in the stomach as well. good quality love these!very soft and fit as expected. amaze-balls super cute!  a little long, but i am tall! ok the color and material are great! they do run a bit tight tho. other than that there awesome luv them! great. comfy these pants are awsome great quality but very long u will have to get them hemmed before u can actually wear them or u will ruin the bottoms after that they look great very comfy i love these leggins because they show off all that figure i have been working hard to get.this is a great product and i would recommend them to others. great these pants fit just right. i get a lot of compliments on them because you don\\'t find this style anywhere. i wash them in gentle cycle with clear soap and hang them dry. they don\\'t fade and look brand new each time i wear them. love them want different colors i like these alot and will wear them in the summer so as not to expose my pearly white legs. nice fabric, and lightweight and big enough to give you a breeze in all the needed places. fit perfectly on my girl, looked cute and highlighted her fantastic booty :) quality item. fast delivery. no complaints. fits great and just the way i wanted, arrived in excellent quality and quickly! i have worn thai pants like these every morning for years; for meditation. i allow myself this one comfort while sitting cross-legged for an hour or so.<br /><br />these particular pants are light-weight, but from inspecting all the seams, they appear to be well made, and i expect them to last. i\\'m 5\\'8&#34;, weigh 164 lbs. and have a 29&#34; inseam. these pants are plenty roomy for meditation sitting. i suspect they would fit someone quite larger than me, as they\\'re pretty much one size fits all.<br /><br />recommended! cool and loose could keep you relax . but the string belt should be a little longer. i ordered these about a week ago and i was very impressed. i have a very small waist so yoga pants never fit me. i was a little nervous about ordering them because i didnt know if they would fit right. the estimated arrival time was about a week later, but i got mine in just 2 days! the waist fit very well, and the fabric is very comfortable and i am so glad i ordered them. they were perfect and i wear them all the time! will definitely order them in other colors. definitely recommend! and best part, the pair i ordered were only $5.99 and i got free shipping with just that one pair! love, love love them! love the pants.... very comfortable. i am short and chubby and they hit me just fine. fit but are somewhat smaller than expected. these are so ridiculously comfortable, soft, and perfect for summer.  if i could live in these,  i would.  my only complaint is the smocked waist which is just a lot of fabric that confuses me as to how to wear it... under my chest or below my belly button, where the model has it is just awkward on my body.  regardless, a long tee takes care of any weird feelings about the waist. size is spot on! fit would be great if they were possibly a size smaller.<br />the &#34;boyfriend fit&#34; is large behind the knees.<br />so it bunches up a little when bent leg and pulls tight when straight however the tightness is not touching the back of my knee.<br />this is my first of lysse so i was unsure of the sizing.<br />i have since ordered a smaller size and they are amazing!  would definitely recommend. the material is soft and comfortable. i wear them all the time around the house. i love them i\\'m 5\\'3 they fit perfectly the material is also very good quality i think these are amazing pants.  i have short legs with thick thighs (no, i\\'m not obese) and a booty.  i find these fit very well. when i received these leggings, i was shocked at how thick and soft the material was. there\\'s just the right amount of stretch as well, making these pants exceedingly comfortable. i love the little pockets and zippers, which add just a bit of detail to make these black leggings a little more interesting. the fit was as expected, as i am a solid 24; the size 22/24 fit me perfectly. product provided by the company to facilitate this review, but all opinions are honest and my own. bought it for tahoe trip. fit well, and is very soft. i\\'m 5\\'1 so the arms and leg length is maybe .5 to 1 inch too long. i ordered a 14w.  i normally wear a 12-14 regular so i thought they would be a little roomier,  but they were a little small, but love them for work with my uniform tops.  wash very well and didn\\'t have to iron.  when i went to reorder them in a large size they were almost twice the price and that was only a few days later??? cute pants for spring and summer to hang out in. very comfortable i ordered the muscle leggings and i love them! warning to girls who are &#34;self-conscious&#34; they do make your butt look big because of the muscles, it\\'s awesome! one bad thing is they will get runs in them relatively easily, but they are super fun! i wore bone leggings under them after they got a few runs and started to rip... really freaked people out. adorable pants! fit amazing i\\'m 5\\'9\\\\\\\\\" 240lbs, 38 inch waist, sizeable rear; they fit perfectly and flow when i walk. cute with heels or flats. love them! love it!! i put these on as soon as they arrived, and i have to say, they are going to be worn every day. they fit great! i\\'m a size 8, so i was worried they would be too small. nope! they are very comfortable and light, which is exactly what i need as a sahm in la. i will definitely be buying more! 5\\'4 160 x-large! very comfortable . i could have ordered a large however i didn\\'t want it to fit too tight!! i purchase the all black and the pink and black... these pants are darling! they fit great! these are the best denim capris ever!  i bought a pair one day, and kick myself for not buying more!  i went back to get more, and couldn\\'t get denim, but got a pair of navy and red.  the denim are still the best, and i\\'ve gone to several target stores and could not find any anywhere.  please make more next year!  thanks! can\\'t go wrong with these!!! perfect fit, a little snug at first but relaxed after a bit. i am definitely a larger bottomed person, thicker through hips, thighs, and tummy area i never expected these to fit and cover me as well as they did. love the pattern as well! love these - very comfortable - using as my comfy work pants.  i will have to hem the pant leg at the bottom hem a bit, but not a problem for me.  it came loose pretty fast.  not exactly abnormal, though.  great comfy work pants! this item was absolutely perfect. the fit was good and comfortable i was happy with the shipping on this purchase.<br /><br />i already owned a pair of these that i bought at target about a year ago--same style number and and size--and have loved them. the new ones are slightly larger than my original pair. i don\\'t know if this means my first pair are smaller than the typical xl or the new ones are larger than the typical xl. i will put the new ones in the dryer and hope this shrinks them a bit. they are close enough, in any case. true to size. length perfect  for  5\\'6  frame. i am still looking for denser, thicker padding but these are the best that i\\'ve found so far.  i\\'m pretty satisfied though. love love love! great fit for petite full figured women =i\\'d buy it again- delivery was fast too i\\'m usually a 22-24 so i was skeptical about ordering but i said eff it. i ordered the 3xl and the bottoms fit more like 1x. they are snug but not umcomfortable.  lucky for me i\\'m not very busty to be plus size so the top fits great. i wish this came in a 4xl otherwise i like the suit love the color and material. very comfortable. nice enough to wear outside not only as lounging pants for indoors. i really love these pants.  i have trouble wearing women\\'s pants because my waist isn\\'t where the supposed waist is supposed to be so most of the female pants i buy put the waist under by breasts.  these fit perfectly. love the material great for winter  fit a little snug  but i make it work  great pants.  love the bunny jeans are great but very long.  this is a challenge for my hemming skills. i love it!<br />i bought a similar design from spanx which was abotu $100.<br />this product cost 1/3 of the other pants, and the fabric feels so much better.<br />love love it! these pants fit and feel great.  i am plus size and they are easy to move around in.  love them. i did remove the upper thigh fringe for what i think is a better look.  the smallest size i could get was medium, so that is why i commented somewhat large, i will alter for a better fit. great for summer evenings - bought several colors... i love jockey scrubs i have these yoga pants in black and *love* them.  the design on the leg and stitching around the upper thighs give the pants a unique flare; the pants themselves are so soft and comfortable.  i wear them multiple times a week as hang-around-the-house pants, and have used them for yoga.  highly recommended! these are my favorite scrub pants. they have lots of well placed pockets and are super comfortable. the only reason they get 4 stars is that they are already fading. i bought 2 other barco sets of black scrubs at the same time. they all get washed together and worn every week. the barco have not faded at all yet. feels great perfect fit, sizing was correct there was nothing i didn\\'t like about this pants. it was the perfect fit and felt very comfortable wearing it to places other than the gym!<br />thank you! the fabric is the star of this uniform, it does not wrinkle and stays in great shape after hours of wear! great pants love the paints order a 14  and returned. they sent a 12 and what a beautiful fit. love love the paints, lined and a soft cream color. everyone should buy these slacks. would love to have in other spring colors. this is a 10 star . i was curious to see how harem pants would feel. i absolutely love these. they are so comfy and i think they\\'re adorable. i\\'d love to get more in other colors. these were inexpensive, comfortable, eay to care for, and fit as expected. i love it soooo much for my girlfriend. but i am not sure of the size how you go about it. my girlfriend waist is 28 inches but you don\\'t posted the size of the shorts. please help out on that superbaby. thanks in advance curious if these are more athletic type pants, or if they could be worn dressy? good quality but is more large of appear even though i took a size too large the pants are good quality for the price. these are the best thing i have ever come across i like it, but.....very tight. [if you have very thin legs..... then it will fit perfect] fit well and fabric is soft but a little thin. these would make better lounge pants- but it is hot where i live so i will wear them out. the fit, style and quality is really good. wanted to order another pair just to have them for later, but they ran out of my size....:((( this is for a cosplay costume, and matches my portal 2 character perfectly. they also fit a male anatomy, without having to spend much more for occasional costuming. love these pants. very comfortable, durable, and soft. they are well made, and look good. the only pants in going to buy for now on. these pants fit great on my very hip-y frame. they feel good and are roomy enough for me to move around, but not get my legs or feet trapped in them. very comfy. i purchased five pairs and they are all great they fit well.  i just ordered some more in different colors.  they are comfortable and each to wash and care for.  the two buttons on the inseam click together as i walk so i just removed them.  if i need to roll them up i\\'ll just use the outside buttons. i like tight on my waist. love the feeling and the look. also i\\'m a trend setter! very nice and comfortable. the elephant pattern is very elegant and just what i wanted. the material is not shear so there is no see through.  one size does seem to fit all, in my opinion. they fit true to size, and so comfy!!! these yoga pants are my new favorite pair.  i love that the black hue of the pant is a true black and the fit is perfect.  they are very comfortable and worth the price. they are too long but i just take them up myself about 11/2 &#34; and they are fine.i\\'m 5\\'6&#34;. awesome! great quality. fit perfectly. just what i wanted for lounging about the house. i\\'m pretty short, so i expected them to be much too long...and they were. but the best part: after cutting off about six inches, i didn\\'t have to hem them as the edges just curled up into a neat little roll. great pants, great price! super cute and comfy came a lot faster than i thought! perfectly packaged, and the leggings are amazing! they fit really well, (i\\'m a size 0/xs), and the material is super comfy. plus for the price, i couldn\\'t resist to buy them! (and a few others hehe) i would definitely (actually, will definitely) buy more from this seller! it was too small but aside from the size i liked the outfit the pants are a good quality and sizes are normal comfortable and great to wear! not to long not to short. a great pair of shorts. these pants are the softest, comfiest pants of all time. a must for pregnant ladies everywhere:) came fast. thank you! a total new way of wearing leggings in such a fashionable way. i love them. thanks  5 stars these are very comfortable.  the material is thick enough to wear to yoga class and not be concerned.  i am 5\\'6&#34; and weigh 149, and the size medium fit perfectly. these pants fit very well, better than described.  the fabric is also very comfortable.      i am also impressed with the speed of the delivery of these pants.      all in all a very good purchase. i never write reviews, but i\\'m writing one about this.  rush to get your purse and buy these jeans!  they are worth every penny!  they look great, feel great, and fit great ---- and that is so so rare for jeans made for women who aren\\'t model perfect and thin. i really love the style and the wide legs are amazing. if your order them order a size smaller then you wear because i ordered a large and they stretched out a lot. the material is kind of thin but will be great for summer  they are the cutest pants though!!!  love them!!!!!!!! must shorten.  ideal for tall women.  comfortable.  i have black, brown, heather gray, charcoal gray and navy and cranberry on the way. bought these in dark teal and love the color. the fit is great and they are very comfortable! they look really good on, too. i would have given them 5 stars but the belt loops seem like they would come off easily if you tug very hard when pulling up the leggings. very soft these pants feel great. they fit perfectly.  i received them very quickly. i bought these to wear to work because i walk slot and it starts to get hot during the day.  they keep me cool ad i don\\'t feel weighed down.  i will be ordering more excelent, pants fit great, packaging and delivery was perfect. i usually wear a size 6 to 8 and bought the medium and the fit so perfect, it\\'s unbelievable. when i wore them to work the first time every commented on how cool my jeans were, because they are :) the only reason why i\\'m not giving them 5 stars is because the from pockets are a little odd. don\\'t really know how to explain that oddness. but it\\'s all good. hope you like them as much as i do. love these pants. they are not sheer. they are very soft and comfortable. i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; and 120 lbs and the medium size fit well. liked them really comfortable very good very warm like the material, easy to wash, looks nice, feels comfortable. as above size 10 a little big.  i would probably purchase korea jeans again. it made me sexy<br />thank u its so hard to find clothes that you feel comfortable in when you are pregnant. i tried these on and they are amazing, they dont cut into my growing belly which is truly amazing. very, very comfortable with a great waistband that adjusts to your waist. so, it fits your hips without being too large at the waist. i will but these again. perfect i love lindsey scrubs.  they are the only style i wear, and they are so comfortable and practical, i often wear them at home, too! i\\'m 4 foot 10 and weat size zero and they fit great. they are roomy but fit me proportionately. i love them. comfy and light. needed alteratons for small size as it was too long for me (i\\'m 5\\'3).<br />like other reviews i\\'ve read, it runs large in waist area as i\\'m having to pull it up often.<br />nice color very nice leggings. i love the crosses and the quick delivery service! i took a chance and ordered a pair of these puma capris to try along with some other brands, not expecting much, but i was wrong! most soft sweat pants lose their shape and get baggy after awhile, but these do not which is a pleasant surprise. the waist and legs stayed nice and close the way they should be. the colors don\\'t seem to fade after washing either. i\\'ve gotten a couple of compliments on these- i was asked what they were and where i got them. i bought another pair in black which are just as nice. puma is doing something right with these! nice fit these are the most comfortable scrubs i have found. they also wash up like new. perfectos the waist.is a bit loose.  folding over doesn\\'t help so i think a thin belt,  my waist is 27&#34;. the fabric is wonderful<br />soooo. soft.  sweet look. perfect fit my only issues with these pants is that the fabric could be thicker, they are too thin to wear in the winter on a cold day, and there are no pockets, i knew this before i ordered them. but i needed pants that were very wide on the lower leg. they got thicker when i washed them, and the fit is great. a good buy!!! i love these pants. i want them in every color. they are comfortable, cool, and great looking. easy on easy care. love them!  no regrets... looking forward to ordering more colors! these pants do not run small, they are more on the normal to large size.  i ordered them for when we are on the boat and they will be perfect! love the feeling these pants  fit well. pockets are deep enough to hold keys without falling out when you sit down. elastic waistband doesn\\'t roll. they wash beautifully. i\\'ll definitely order more. theese shorts look and feel amazimg. they fit extremely well. i would definitely buy them again. also arrived sooner then expexted. nydj jeans fit and make you look good/  wasn\\'t sure how they would fit and i\\'ve only worn them once so far but they are great even though they are really expensive. so many compliments on a super comfortable pair of pants! it looks great but for super skinny girls its a bit big....wish you would make an extra small...otherwise it was great these pants were great! they held up for a few months but began to wear after a few months. well worth the money and they fit very well. these pants are amazing, i am s happy i bought them. i am 5\\'8&#34; and 130 lbs. and the fit perfectly. i usually wear between a 4 and 6 in pant size. these pants could definitely fit someone a little bit larger then me. they can stretch quite a bit. highly recommend. also, i would recommend not drying them. i was mine on delicate cycle and hang dry. i\\'m 5\\'8&#34; and these are long enough to wear with 3&#34; heals. the material is thick enough so their not see thru. this line is finally long enough! kinds short and a lil tight but very cute. shows the right amount of booty(very little) and ihave a really big booty. first i loved them then i washed them and my long pants became short pants.. never dreamed they would shrink what a disappointment :0( i read the reviews but thought they were exagerated, so i purchased the small size anyway. it fits a little tight - not too much - but next time i will purchase medium.<br />the charcoal acid color looks very acid or washed, maybe because the background is dark.<br />the textile is very soft and comfortable. excellent quality, fit perfect. great pants. i wear them to work. great pants not too thick. comfortable. good item.  as described.  cheaper elsewhere. fits a little large but quality of fabric good will see after washes how they hold up. so rad! they fit very comfortably and are just so unique! can\\'t wait to strut them out on the prowl.... super comfortable and stylish.  i can wear these with a yoga shirt or wear with a sweater and go out.  very versatile pair of pants. these pants were surprisingly good. they fit quite well in most people, since the fabric is elastic and they are really warm. they have an elastic band at the end, so even i (i\\'m 5ft tall) could wear it without havint to cut pieces of fabric at the end (as i normally have to). 29.5\\\\\\\\\" inseam (significantly longer than cuddle duds). lands end sizing: size 0-4 is xs; 6-8 is s; 10-12 is m; 14-16 is l; 18-20 is xl. given this size structure, silk pant is true to size. feels wonderful under jeans and pants. lightweight, warm, comfortable enough to sleep in. very pleased with quality of all lands end clothing. for talls (33.5\\\\\\\\\" inseam), try eddie bauer, [[asin:b0049ay25g eddie bauer silk underwear pant]]. love them!! fit perfect, and the material is very good. these pants fit kind of snug but they\\'re so stretchy they\\'re very comfortable. i love them and will be getting another pair. true to size - fits like a nike product. material is nice. i wear these to work out at least 3 times a week! very comfy & cute. unfortunately they ripped th first week. i would buy again though & just be more careful. not good material for actual yoga exercise they were a bit snug. i saw a lot of people suggest going up a size, but neglected to do so because i\\'m a strange middle size. overall i love them though! they aren\\'t tight on my waist in a bad way and they are stretchy. i don\\'t feel like i\\'m going to blow the seams in them even though they are tight. if you\\'re a 6/7 in blue jeans, large will undoubtedly fit perfectly. also, these pants got here in 2 days. so fast! very pleased! the fabric is fantastic for hot summer days. love these!! perfect fit ♡ after reading all the reviews i ordered my 10 yr old 2 pairs of the woman\\'s small stir up tights and they fit perfect although without reading the reviews i would have ordered her a youth large and they would have been way too small!!!! they definitely run small my daughter is 85 lbs and the adult small fit perfect and we had no problems putting them on!!! the quality is excellent i was very happy with my purchase and most of all the price considering i would have spent $60 for 2 pair at the local dance store in our area shipping was also free and i received them earlier than what was stated the pants fit great i love love love these pants.  i purchased for my liturgical dance class and it met all my expectations.  i actually received several compliments about the way it fit and flowed!  great purchase.  when i am done with the class i can definitely use it for daily wear. looks very cute and worth d price. lovely stuff. i like it. to small for the x-large i cannot express how much i love these pants! they are so comfortable and perfect for summer. i ordered more because they are so perfect. there was a minor defect on the first pair i ordered but their customer service was very responsive and i had a new pair at no cost to me within 2 days. these are easily my favorite pregnancy pants! i just recieved these today, and i love them. here\\'s some things maybe some of you will find helpful. first off i\\'m 5\\'3 and around 110lb,so i got the small size.i have average length legs for my height, and a pretty flat behind. i do not have a flat tummy like in the picture which is always a concern when buying pants. i am also short waisted which means these do not sit on my hips, but thats fine, most don\\'t. i don\\'t have curvy hips, but if you do i think these have the room,and will look great. the length is what made my happiest. they just hit the floor with no shoes on, usually pants are always way too long. oh, the elastic waist fits snug, but i like that because i won\\'t have to be pulling them up all the time( small hips).as far as undie lines? yes,but nothing a thong or some kind of seamless panties won\\'t solve. super comfy material, i could sleep in them. i hope some of this is helpful to someone out there. got these and i love them. they seemed to shrink a little bit after a couple of washes, but not enough to be noticeable. i live in a very hot place, but these are perfect for both hot and cool weather, and are super comfortable.<br /><br />just a tip, i don not usually wear crop tops at all unless i have a tank top under it, and even then it looks a little funny just because i prefer not to show my belly, but it works perfectly with the high-waist pants because it doesn\\'t show anything and makes a good combo.<br /><br />i find it worth my money. love love love!!!! true to size i wear 3x and 5\\'9&#34; ish perfect length for flats or lower to mid  heels. love these - i have them in every color pattern available. they are comfortable and stylish as well as professional. these pants are just as pictured. i like the fabric quality, soft but sturdy. i do not think they will loose their shape. i am 5\\'6&#34; and the length is just what i want, same as the model in the picture. ordered a small. i wear a size 4-6 in pants, 125 weight, and the waist is a bit big. however, when the pants are cinched at the waist they are still flattering, even from behind which is good! someone with a bit bigger waist and thighs could fit into a small as well, in my opinion. worth the price! nice quality materials, i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; so i did have to get them hemmed shrinks when washed. i am still able to wear them, and they look great, but i liked the prewar he\\'d fit better. reviewed a pair of red pants from the same company. well-made, quality fabric/stitching, beautiful color, and comfortable. they\\'re just a half size too small. i\\'m a size 12 (+curvy) and purchased a size 13. the dimensions on the sizing chart should have made this a perfect fit; unfortunately, i\\'ll have to wait until i\\'m a few pounds smaller before i can wear them. i could button, zip, and sit down in them; but my stomach was muffin-topped, my bladder was compressed, and i was in risk of plumber\\'s-butt with every action. aside from the waistline, they fit perfectly! even with my &#34;thunder-thighs&#34;, the legs were an easy, comfortable fit. worth the purchase; just know your body and be wary of how clothes fit you. i just love the koi brand...  these pant are so comfortable .. and i get a lot of complements.<br />every chance i get to get new scrubs. they are koi\\'s..  you will love these pants!!!! super excited to have finally gotten these! they came in a couple weeks early so that was great. they fit really nicely, the elastic waistband is great and the material is soft and light! i\\'m 5\\'7&#34; and the length is fine, fits from the knee down like leggings, right to the top of the ankle. the animal print on is cute and good quality. overall really satisfied, well worth the money. order these bad boys! love these. i was concerned about them being too small. i wear a medium and they fit great. not too sheer in the butt either. this pants have a great fit in the seat and waist. i do wish they were a bit longer, as i have a 32\\\\\\\\\" inseam, but they are much better than any pair of women\\'s snowbaord pants i have had before in terms of length. it is difficult finding non-black pants for longer legs. if there were more colors, i would buy some more!  i love these plush, fleece pants great for sleeping and around the house.  fit like yoga pants nice blue color, not too see thru. these leggings are exactly what i was looking for and exactly as i hoped they would be. i am so happy with this purchase. as expected, they did run a little small, more than i expected but they still fit really well. the material is pretty good for the price, nice and stretchy to allow for a little &#34;give&#34;. i\\'m 5\\'5 and the length is also really nice, although i\\'m built a little more long than average and the waist band doesn\\'t come up as high as i would like but other than that, the length of the legs is perfect for me. i would totally recommend these to anyone looking to buy metallic leggings. affordable, stretchy, fits well, good quality. 100% happy i got these. i love these pants.  they fit quite well and the fabric is soft and gentle to the skin. they are so comfortable, and affordable<br />i am very happy with them. they were not solid black they were a print brown and white but i liked them. i bought these for my wife as a gift. she absolutely loves them. great comfortable pants-i bought every color available.  very soft material. they do run a bit large in size though. i love these pants but they are definitely too small. i was very pleased with these leggings.  i am 5\\'4&#34; and weigh 135# and they fit nicely.  the waist was actually what i would consider to be a mid-rise and i was very pleased with that.  others mentioned a chemical odor, which was present when i purchased them.  i\\'ve worn and washed them twice now and that is mostly gone.  they washed nicely without shrinking and have a very nice, soft fleece lining.  i\\'ll be buying another pair as they are a great value for the money. soon as i opened the bag they came in, i got a little nervous. unfolding them i thought \\\\\\\\\"i already hate them.\\\\\\\\\"  the shape of them is so different. but soon as i tried them on, i loved them. super comfy and they look cool. though the pattern i received mine in, may be the same color. but the actual pattern of the fabric is completely different. all in all, it was worth it. great for lazy/summer days. i love clothes that are out of the ordinary.  these pants are comfortable,  with beautiful coloring.  it is also nice to find a pant that is truly long enough awesome product. its comfortable. not too tight and allows me to workout without any problems. thankful i bought it. it was worth it i liked it, u have to wear a bodyshaper or have a cute shape for it to look right but no problems so far. i\\'m obsesses with these. i have a pair in red also. they look tiny when first opened but they stretch and are so comfortable!! i love the flare bottoms too. bought these for a family member and she really likes these cozy warm and plush pj bottom. these are amazing!! so comfy and a must have for cold weather!! i plan on buying more when i lose weight, god willing! lol i have been a nurse for 12 years, and koi is by far my favorite scrubs. if you are under 5 foot tall even the petite is slightly long. but those of us under 5 foot tall are used to that. ;) exactly what i wanted, fits perfectly. just right for a-line knee length skirts. doesn\\'t ride up either. soft, comfortable, but see thru and too big, order smaller than your regular size. bright red very comfortable... for a yoga beginner and not being real thin, these do the trick for comfort and style. i didn\\'t want to wear the skin tight yoga pants...this was the answer love these pants these pants are wonderful.  they are long as stated.  they are comfortable, wash easily and packs well for travel.<br />they have become a favorite. they look great on my girlfriend =] cute love them alittle long but fit great it looks nice the leggings are great quality and a very good quality, vibrant colors. awesome!! they fit perfetly if a little long because im short but that doesnt matter really. love them!! received really fast. ordered it last week and got it today. i\\'m usually about a 34/36 d/dd (depending on how small bra/tips are made) i ordered the 3xl due to everyone saying is really small i\\'m usually about an xl/2xl (depending on how small is made) does show a little side boob but side boob never hurt nobody lol. definately recommend! and is very flattering! they look more or less exactly like the picture, and i really like the fabric! i would never wear these on their own! but under a pair of white pants they are perfect! thank you best pants ever!!! like them just smaller than expexted i love these pants ! the elastic waist is perfect, it stretches and the pants aren\\'t too stiff on me ☺️ i bought the pokemon leggings. they are less colorful than i expected but i love them. the material is great! nice pants and at a nice price.<br /><br />i am 5\\'5 26&#34; waist and i got them in small which fit great. they are not super long like some of other palazzo pants i own, which is nice because i can wear them with my flats. great costume but the pants are kinda ugly very comfortable, perfect fit! i love these pants! very comfy, great pants! a little to short for me great pair of workout pants. i wear them while doing zumba. nice fit and the colors are nice. i will buy more fast shipping  person note with item good quality i\\'ve been wearing these pants for years. i have them in almost every color. they make you look so slim and the ankle pants look good with almost any heel height. great pants, had to return, my poor 5\\'10 daughter who is a size 20, can\\'t find pants anywhere that are talls and size 20, found them with these guys, but my daughter isn\\'t allowed to work them at the restaurant she works at because of the cargo pant pocket.  make these pants with normal pockets only as well please!!!!  good workmanship!  we had to return but we\\'re holding out hope from a company who makes a great product at a reasonable price!!!! i really do like these pants. the fit is wonderful and very flattering. the pants aren\\'t see through or cheap material like most are, and as most people stated. they\\'re very good quality for the brand. i\\'m a little short (5 ft 3) with hips, thighs, butt and got a large. perfect fit, just a tiny bit long. (i actually like them that way!) all in all they\\'re great pants to lounge or go out and about in. enjoy! love it. it loves my curves and its good quality. everything i expected. spandex material true to fit ...tip ( always order a size up when ordering online) unless there\\'s a review that says other wise. this is a shosho brand which isn\\'t mentioned in the description. i have these in black, espresso, dark gray and true navy. very warm, comfy and does not fall down! great to wear alone, thick and opaque. this seller and another by &#34;aleggings&#34; are perfect—both the shosho brand. [[videoid:74152a03e460326a8fd45ff20df11079]]i love these pants! i wear them all around the house and i can\\'t tell you how comfortable these are. i\\'m tall. 5\\' 9\\\\\\\\\" and they fit like they were made for me. if you roll down the waist and pull them up...this may help with the length issue that some people are having. bueno beautiful pjs. soft, comfy and i just love the print. these pants are so comfortable. they are literally so comfy and i can wear them anywhere because even though they are casual they have such a pretty design on them. another really cool thing is that you can have them at your regular waist or you can make them high waisted and wear them with a cute crop top! absolutely amazing. and the shipping was pretty fast too! definitely buying from here again if i can! love it i haven\\'t wore these yet but i did try them on. they are very comfy. the material is silk like & very flowy. the material is really thin so i probably won\\'t wear them on a cold day. they are too long so i\\'ll have to take them up some, but i\\'m also a little on the short side. shipping was quick. good stuff. used around the house very comfortable. what other colors? i am 8 months pregnant, and these pants are sooooo comfortable.  the material is thin and super stretchy.  they look cute on too! i love them but they are cut on the small size. these are very nice for the money and fit like a second skin, just what i wanted.  not sure how they will last or wash but time will tell. the pants are fantastic. they fit perfectly and were true to size. they look great as well as feel great on. wear with a black tunic dress.  looks fantastic! nice set for the price. was not totally impressed by the material of outfit.....but the pants are awesome and comfortable. i recently lost quite a bit of weight and had this style of capri in a larger size.  i love them so much that i ordered 3 more pair 2 sizes smaller.  these capris are lightweight and very well constructed. i love the wide waistband.  very comfortable to wear and the sizing is accurate.  i ordered a dark navy, black, and olive green in the capri and just yesterday ordered 2 pair of the same style in the long pants. these pants are very nice and comfortable. my teen daughter wanted them and they are different, she likes them very much. i\\' m happy with this product. thank you. i\\'m so excited that i found these pants on amazon!  i used to buy these all the time at a little beach store in san diego....but then i moved to the midwest.  i love the way they fit. i haven\\'t found any other sweatpants as cute/comfortable as these and at a good price point.  i agree with the other review, we need more of the light colors. they fit as expected and are a decent quality of jeggings makes riding my bike more enjoyable. long trips are a breese. i love the fact when i get back from a long trip my butt doesn\\'t hurt. i\\'m 6\\'2&#34; 200lbs and live in west hollywood and love these pants. get some! i bought this outfit for a party, sort of disco themed. i am kind of top heavy so it was not quite perfect for me but then i knew looking at the sizes that it might not fit perfect. i was pleasantly surprised, it stretched well, fit amazing on me, and though was quite revealing, that was the look i was going for so it was ok by me. and i got a ton of compliments on it! love these! they are long which is great for heels, would need to hem for flats. i am 5&#34;6. we love the look and comfort that the current palazzo trend provides! look sexy, stylish and vibrant while remaining comfortable and relaxed.<br /><br />we carry many palazzos like this, including this one, in our store in panama as well as our online shop on paystand. the added beauty of these is that you can customize the length yourself using a sharp pair of scissors. you can wear them with flat sandals or chunky heels! i have several pairs myself and tend to wear them out to an event in heels, then cut a few inches so i can enjoy the ease of wearing them to work and play everyday after the big night out.<br /><br />so don\\'t worry about paying a seamstress, take charge of your custom length!<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />if you want to see how we wear them, come join us on instagram! @nido_shop it was larger as expected but it great! i really like it! i. have a curvier butt and these fit just right, i\\'m 5\\' 5&#34; and the length was just right also the jumpsuit is awesome. the fit is perfect. they are stylish and so comfortable. i brought 3 suits! thank you amazon \\x1a\\x1a\\x1a\\x1a these pants are exactly what i was looking for! they are comfortable, allow ample space in the area of my growing belly, and my husband is a big fan of how they fit, too! i don\\'t feel like i\\'m wearing maternity pants, but just pants that fit well in all the right places. when these arrived, i immediately ordered two more pair to have different colors. highly recommended for lounge pants! i just received the black pair that i purchased a few days ago and am going back to buy more.  love them so much that i am probably going to buy another pair of black because i predict that i will be living in these pants :)  great for around the house and cute with a tank top for running errands.  can probably pair with a top for going out to dinner as well.  very versatile and extremely comfortable!<br /><br />i\\'m 5\\'3 and 125 lbs and the small fits great.  i will have to have the length hemmed but that\\'s par for the course as i have a long torso, so you can imagine how short my legs are at 5\\'3 with a long torso :)  will definitely be buying more and would recommend to anyone!  love. them. wife loves them i like them a lot and everything - they are comfy, but i wish the ankle cuffing wasn\\'t so tight. these completely fleece lined sweat pants are nice quality. they are not slouchy. actually they don\\'t \\\\\\\\\"scream\\\\\\\\\" sweatpants. unless your work environment is ultra conservative, these can be worn to work on a cold day....especially in the darker colors.<br /><br /> the material is heavier weight, very soft,  and warm. the all around elastic waist is not tight or binding. the band is approximately 2\\\\\\\\\" wide. the drawstring is functional and allows for tightening or loosening the waistband. the legs are a little roomier than photograhed. the side pockets are nice and deep, but don\\'t add any bulk to the hip area. they\\'re sewn into the seam very nicely. i think these pants run large. it\\'s best to check out the size chart before ordering. the fleece sweatpants are also available in a cargo style that has a big patch pocket on the leg.<br /><br />i  purchased the matching fleece lined hoodie in grey. with the hoodie, you get a casual, but very put together look. as of this review, the hoodie is 24.99. not oversized, it looks very neat and flattering. makes a attractive set. delivered quickly by fedx. i work in a business casual environment and finding maternity dress pants has been nothing short of a nightmare. now, these are not dress pants, however they are think enough to not show anything through them and can be easilly dressed up with a nice top and accessories. and for the price, these cannot be beat! they run big!!! i ordered a small. couldn\\'t imagine ordering an extra small. i like them though and they are comfortable. wife said it fits perfect and she loves it. very comfortable, perfect these are wonderful pants!  i love the print and how they fit and feel!  fast shipping too! this product is great for exercise wise and daily wear. this is really comfortable and once you wear it, you will wear it every single day.<br />the shipping was very fast and the quality is very good. this product looks just like the picture. it matches with anything with shirt, hoodies, and etc. highly recommended. these are very cute and fit well on larger hips and legs. they are very comfy and make you look slim . would love to have more in other colors. i purchased one size up as i do not like my pants to tight. it was perfect. great pants. good this is an extemely cute outfit for people that want to protect from uv rays. love i love them if you like comfort then these are the pants for you! my wife loves these yoga pants for the great value and good quality.  she rarely does yoga but says they work well for all types of work-outs.  very pleased. i love this out fit ! always try to buy pembrook when i can find them at a fair price. i paid for express mailing and was not disappointed at all. these outfits are perfect for running around doing errands and to lounge around the house. every women would love this out fit... sooooo soft on the skin. just wish they had draw string waste that\\'s the only thing i would say is missing. this is a must buy !!! bought these for my granddaughter.  she loves them and wears them all the time.  comfy and cute. at a great price.  what else do you need. fits me perfectly. i have three pairs of these and use them for gym. they\\'re really great, i\\'m sure they will last long... very comfortable! great multipurpose pant. i like it. love the photos!!! but- need to know sizing for pants. recommend if anyone reviews pants- list height/weight and how did the pants fit you?<br />baggy-tight............short or long? i\\'ve read reviews on a few sights and reviews are mixed. do these run true to size? or slim fit or not slim fit?<br />is a medium truly a medium? i\\'m 5/6 and 140...........i usually wear mediums and 8 pants........most brands. please- this would be so helpful love the color and fit, the only thing i dont like is how see through it is. i absolutely love these leggings! i normally wear a size 10-11 in pants and have a big butt, so i have to be careful about which underwear i wear underneath to prevent it showing through because i stretch out the leggings a bit, but other than that these are pretty great. another problem i have with them being a bit small for me is that they tend to slip down and sag throughout the day, so i just pinch part of the waistband together and safety pin it to keep it in place (i find i have to do this with most leggings). they\\'re sure to turn heads and get you lots of compliments/comments on your style when you wear them around! received on time. good quality. comfortable. but short, even with flat. my height is 5.5. fits accurate in the waist, but short- not as slouchy as in the photo. trying to return. otherwise very cute, bright polyester! it\\'s great quality. it fit me perfect.  i can\\'t think of one bad thing to say about these pants.  i would buy them again in a heartbeat. thought i was ordering spalding brand of yoga pants - that was what i searched for and this is what came up. don\\'t like this brand or material as much as i like spalding and material feels very flimsy which the price reflects that - did get a good deal these pajama bottoms are made by &#34;intimo for her&#34; neither of the 2 tags have the hanes or champion label listed anywhere.<br />i haven\\'t washed these yet, but they seem a little longer in length than most, and have a very high waist also.<br />the material is really cute, and the fit seems true to size. they have a warehouse smell, so they\\'re going right into the wash. hope this helps! kinda small, but fit fine. made my butt look bangin! they are high wasted and they are made pretty well i hesitantly ordered up a size due to the reviews.  i wear a size 14, and the xxl fit pleasantly more snug than i thought they would through the waist and butt, which i like, and it\\'s a nice contrast to the volume in the legs.  very flowy silhouette, and a nice long length for platform sandals, even with my tall 5\\'7&#34; height. symmetrical pattern lines up on both legs well, and is only slightly off at the seam. love them! this was my second pair  of gaucho capri wide legged  pants. i just love them. i have to wear a leg brace on my left leg and i can not wear regular pants, so these gaucho pants just fit right and  i will order some more in different colors. this is a nice fitting jumper that flatters your shape and also exposes any lumps so be wary. can easily be dressed up. love it great price! these pants are so cute and fit perfect. i am 5\\'6 and weigh about 185 and the large fit perfect. they are long enough to wear with heels and believe it or not with flats too. i didn\\'t know what to expect being that they show to be really flare, but they were not bad and i recieved a lot of compliments on them. great buy. really like these scrubs comfortable i just got these today i love them they look just like picture they fit great and came before expected date thank u loved it! great material, great colors and pattern!  so comfortable! .... just as before, i am a short plump woman in a tall world. 4 foot 11 inches like a pear. i wrote the same review for a dress from romans. i forgot to say i am disabled so heels are out. now lets see if the fashion world can help me look nice not frumpy. these are basically jeggings. pretty design. weigh about 140lbs & ordered a large to be safe. way too big around the waist but fits everything else great.  very comfortable, won\\'t ever having to worry about being tight around the stomach area. arrived on time....loved the pattern....love the fit, very comfortable....i ordered 3 extra to lounge in and in case one is in the laundry. love them!! yoga pants fit very well, extremely comfortable, pleasing style. good dress pants! medium quality but they fit well. i like the flare of the leg. love them!!! fit perfect, nice conforming stretch fit! true to size!! can\\'t wait to wear them on valentines day!!! love these pants! i have lots of the lindsey fit kois but from not on this is my favorite. they are so much more comfortable around the waist. love these! you will not believe the quality & fit of this product.  buying fashions online is very risky, sometimes.  i was especially leary to purchase yoga pants which can be too short in the rear and in the length.  maybe i just got lucky, but these are the most wonderful, gorgeous, best fitting, great length, comfortable pants i have ever purchased. don\\'t hesitate to purchase these.  you will love them! love it they are nice pants if they could fit. i wear a 9/10 and the one size just wasn\\'t working.  its a shame because i really like them. thank you! love the color,  all the cool pockets,  great cargos for hiking.  very comfortable pants!  just love my new cargos! can\\'t wait to buy another pair,  or maybe two. ;) great these are cute. material is a little shiny but not too much. the zipper at bottom side is a really cute accent. the material feels pretty sturdy. i\\'m sure they\\'ll last a while. i would recommend and will buy from them again these are very well made, fit perfectly and look like new after many washings.  they really do smooth the tummy, hips and thighs and look so great under tunics and tops - no tummy roll or bulge!  these are the 5th pair of leggins in this brand i have purchased and i highly recommned them.  they have a very dark, denim color. this item is amazing. my husband says that my butt looks very sexy wearing this beauty. all i can say go for it ladies and don\\'t miss the chance. very happy! comfortable , classy. i am 5.7 and i had to wear heals with the pants. they are long. but over all got lots of compliment . these tights are great and very flattering; i wear them for water aerobics and they\\'ve held up really well, despite the chlorine. i love the feel of the material. the fit is a little tight love my pants!!! ♡♡♡ so cute thx fit really nice and comfortable beyond in love with these pants. i can\\'t wait to get more pairs! i bought these for a beach trip and they worked well. i am short, 5\\'4, so the capris fit more like most ankle-length pants. this is typical for me, i hem most pants, but these looked fine and since they were for the beach, i kept them as is. the linen isn\\'t the best quality, but for the price, it\\'s worthwhile. i was really happy about the pockets, and surprisingly they didn\\'t wrinkle nearly as much as i had anticipated. i love these leggings!  they have a cute print and are soo soft!  they were comfortable and i would def get another pair from imixcity!! i seriously have my my new favorite outfit. ever! i am so in love with this jumpsuit.  i have never worn one before, so i was a little hesitant to how i would look in it, but i absolutely feel so comfortable and so stylish in it.<br />i chose the black jumpsuit and ordered a size small.  the fit was perfect, as expected.  the top of the jumpsuit has an elastic cinch tube top, with flowy fabric that cascades down to the waist- where there is another cinched elastic waist.  this really helps to give it the form fit in the areas you want to show off.  the fabric around the hips and upper legs fit great, and then the fabric flares out into a wide leg pant.<br />the best part is the fabric is thin and comfortable,  yet thick enough to where it is not see through!<br />i love dressing this jumpsuit up with wedges and heels, or flats, necklaces, or bangles.  i wore this out to dinner last night and received many compliments, and even my sister is already buying one too!<br />this is such a comfortable jumpsuit, that can be worn any time of the year, to any event.  i feel so good in it!<br />**i received this product to review in exchange for my 100% honest opinion. love something that i can wear rafting, surfing, or such that works. these are not board shorts that redefine the shortness of daisy dukes. i can feel like a human wearing these and focus on swimming rather than wedgies or other clothing embarrassments. i bought three different types of &#34;yoga&#34; pants at the same time to see which brand i liked best. this is by far my favorite. i\\'m 5\\'4&#34;, so length (too long) was going to be an issue. these are perfect for me; they reach the ground when i\\'m barefoot, but they still have some give where they can fit someone up to about 3-4 inches taller. the ability they have to fit on different areas of the hip, allows a good bit of lengthening or shortening as needed. the material is thick enough that the pants feel durable; however, i don\\'t think i\\'d buy them in a light color because those colors in jersey knit are very unforgiving. i have lost about 14 lbs. since i bought the large, so they\\'re not stretched out on me, but they have enough spandex, that they still fit very well (whereas my other brands are now loose). [just if you\\'re wondering what size to get for yourself, i was 168 lbs. when i first started wearing the large, and although they were comfortable, i wouldn\\'t go out in public much with them (without a long shirt or jacket), but now at 154, the large is still very comfortable but hangs much nicer.] for the price and the variety of colors, i would recommend trying them out. woolrich womens cord pants(dk. (laden green).  these are great cords.  i wasn\\'t sure about the color, but i love the color too!  they are warm and comfy. i am thinking of buying another pair, but a different color. use the size chart,  pants run larger but the chart works perfectly!  pants are nice and long and after one wash i am still not disappointed.  they are a bit on the thinner side but extremely comfortable for work or for casual.  ordering another pair for sure. these leggings get the full 5 stars cuz they fit me right, they\\'re comfy, & they\\'re so cute, 👍 none... very happy, a little long, but since i am short, this was expected. they have a very classy casual look.  fit was great.  however they do run long, after washing them i did have to hem them.  but so worth it. nice summer wear bought these for my sister who is usually a size small and she loves it, the fabric is thic enough not so much stretch but works for her.  she has normal legs not too skinny and suited her like a glove, i would recommend this to anyone between the sizes xs and s. it actually came faster than expected so we are happy with this purchase. seems to be as advertised. material is nice and fits well. i bout the r2d2/c3po leggings and figured that for (approx.) $7, they\\'d be kind of crappy, so i got 2 pairs. they are fantastic! the butt is a bit see through, as there isn\\'t any dark print there but they look great with long sweaters. much higher quality than i expected. i would have gladly spent more money on these! i wore them to work today and got tons of complements. i love these harem pants! i also love the zipper detail on them. they fit true to size. i am 5\\'2 and 120 lbs. but they will fit up to a size 6 easily if you get the small size. i did have to get the length made a little shorter since i am very petite lol. i can wear these casual with flip flops or dressy with heels! very nice drapey soft fabric. will buy again and fast shipping! these work really well in holding the bottoms of your pants down so they do not bunch up at the top of your boot.  i think i would like them better if they were made of elastic rather than a soft plastic. i loved the print... but the sizing was off for me... too small.  i shared them with a smaller, taller friend. excellent harem pants. i love ellazhu. i like how it fits and it\\'s very comfortable niceeee have you ever had bursitis of your ischial tuberosities (sit bones)?? well, i have, and it\\'s not a pleasant experience. i foolishly did some long distance riding without padded shorts & ended up with an excrutiating case of bursitis. i don\\'t ever want to experience that again. with these shorts, i can ride 30+ miles without any soreness in my butt whatsoever. i never leave home without them! :) very good deal comfortable enough,  but i would order a size down if i were to do it again.  they run larger.  they are also too long to wear under my shorts which is disappointing, but they work fine under leggings longer skirts. legs roll a little,  but i\\'ve never found any undershorts that didn\\'t at all. i got the smallest size.  top was large.  bottom fits good.  im 5\\'2 115 pounds.  i was worried that the pants would be long and needed hemming.  but these didnt.  good for petite people. makes up for the large top. i can deal with it with an undershirt.  just enough looseness is comfortably fine.  wrong top sizing forgiven i was more concerned about the bottom being too long anyway.. these pants are made well. they are very comfortable and cute! they fit perfectly and they are going to be great for lounging and some outdoor fun. i love the fabric. great deal! these could be a little more generous. great for very slenderly built women. at 5\\'3&#34; and 125#, these are motivating me to give up my love affair with chocolate. super comfortable soft material. they run long which looks beautiful but makes them sadly unwearable without heels. (i am 5\\'9) purchased for my 12 year old who wears about a size 16 in girls or size 7 in junior\\'s.  perfect fit.  needed a quick, cheap costume for a party and this was shipped fast.  tyvm love them need them for a hippie fest, so i haven\\'t worn them yet.  tried them on, they are comfortable and the length is great for me at 5\\'7&#34; i bought these for a neighbor of mine who could not find any pants that were plus size high quality. she loves them and they fit great!!!! awesome colors too! my first pair of pants that fits like a glove, i bought all 3 colours. great pants great pants and they don\\'t roll down like some spanx products! i returned this one because i received size m and i know my order was size s. i\\'m 5\\'1 - 118lb. so yeah it\\'s too big. fit great! love the design i absolutely lovvvveeeee these leggings it\\'s not faux leather but it\\'s not cheap material comfy and warm just got these today. so happy with how they look, feel, and fit! in the picture the stripes seem wider but once you get them the stripes are small.<br />they are see thur and very thin. do fit to the ankle though i am happy! ok the fit was good, just a little short for my taste my daughter loves music....listening, playing her instrument....so these were a great christmas gift for her.  she is 13 and fits a women\\'s medium and these fit her great. these are amazing!  fit perfectly. ordered medium in 2 colors and will order more. ooooh so perfect...yes a little see through if you order a light color, fix that problem & order darker, but these pants are perfect. love them i will always reorder and suggest these bad babies, if you\\'re a leggy person who enjoys highwaisted goodness and cruelty free fabrics, these are your jam! get em! these (sweat)pants are so comfortable and soft! the pockets are rad and cuffed ankle keeps its shape nicely. i love these, and want two more pair just like them. the fit is perfect, just as advertised and true to size chart reference. shopping didn\\'t take as long as predicted.  i ordered it 5/24 and got it 6/6.  i\\'m 4&#34;11 and 150 so i there\\'s the size large because i\\'m 5 months pregnant and expect to get bigger.  it fits perfectly and very comfortable!  however, the only weird part is that the waist band goes right across my belly and the bow is on my belly button.  with most maternity clothes, the waist band normally sits above or below the belly.  but it still looks cute! i wouldn\\'t recommend this to a tall person over 5\\'3&#34; because it might be ankle length. i wish these were available in more colors because i love them. i like that the waste is not super low so i can cover my muffin top. they are plenty long which is good because they shrank a little bit in the wash. i have thin legs so the small actually are a better fit for me than the medium because the legs tend to &#34;bag&#34; out a little when you wear them. they shrink up again when you wash them. the waste band is very comfortable and my favorite feature. these are cute and flattering but a little bit see-through, and a little smaller than i\\'d imagine a medium to be. almost like juniors sizing. but they\\'re super soft, nicely stretchy, and the color is great. i also love that they have pockets. the neighbors are going to howl alfred dunner never disappoints. i always buy these pants for my basic wardrobe. am very satisified with the merchandise.  fits great and also the right length.<br />always happy not to have to return merchandise. lost for words so many compliments everywhere i go. confortable and relaxed fit. honestly, just go with the size chart and if you have to measure you waist, hips and thighs then do it! everyone\\'s body is different. overall, i love these pants and i will be buying more. when they say big legs they mean it. go a size smaller. very fast delivery!! daughter loved the pants! this is a really nice palazzo pant! it\\'s not too wide, which i was afraid of because i am a small person. they were a little long, but then again, i am short so it may be okay for others. it had a nice feel to it; it was a little stretchy but not really. it is high-waisted which is very flattering and also has a fold-down waist. it is also cheap! very nice buy! best yoga pants i have ever owned - nice bootcut leg and very high waist to keep in the bit of postpartum bagel bulge. expected to receive these by the 7th of january ... received them the 31st of december!!! they look good, fit well and feel very nice. i\\'m 5\\'8 and these are way long, great for heels and better than being too short looks and fits great, well made comfortable, flattering fit, very soft fabric. great fit very nice very nice fit perfect right length for 5\\'4 love them pants are very nice and good service i love love love the pattern on this high waisted bikini. i am a size 16; 44-38-46. i wear a 40 d bra.<br /><br />this bathing suit is a good purchase for the price. my only complaint is that the top is made far too small. i ordered the 2xl and was worried about the bottom fitting over my big butt while still fitting snug around my natural waist. the bottoms fit perfectly but i was spilling out of the top. fortunately because this is a bikini i can simply go purchase a different top to go with!!!! i am getting more in different colors cute new stuff but some run a bit small, and it would be nice to include more bottoms. they are a little thin but the length is good and they are a really great color. they fit like my other palazzo pants around my behind and hips and that\\'s a plus. if i would have seen them in a store though i\\'m pretty sure i would have passed them up on account of thinness but i\\'m not going to return them. they fit pretty big, but very comfy! will have it taken in at the sides and length wise, very long i\\'m 5\\'6 but beautiful and cannot wait to get size mediums hi,<br />i was searching for comfy pants in the my last weeks of pregnancy and ordered this a week ago. i am very pleased with them. they are soft and very comfortable. i hope to order another pair. in fact, i\\'m wearing them now!! i\\'m 36 weeks pregnant and don\\'t like anything tight against my tummy. these are heavenly.:-) i am so happy that i ordered these. absolutely love them. fits nice and snug! what is not to like.....the detail of the &#34;buttons&#34; is great....and the fit is perfect as well....can\\'t say enough good things about them. very comfortable but very big. material is thin. i really liked the look and fit of the jeans. the only thing i didn\\'t like was that the color is darker than the color in the picture, but they are still cute. i love these jeans! they are a little tight but if you wash them with cold water and gently stretch them they do stretch and fit perfectly!! i also love the ripped bits, not too much or too little! i recommend these jeans, but do keep in mind that they are in asian size! i ordered a medium which should have fit but they are very high waisted and big around the waist.  i just rolled the waistband one time and i\\'m good to go.  i live in florida so i may be able to wear these even in the summer that\\'s how light weight they are.  they don\\'t appear to be sheer either.  other reviews have posted that they received tights that were smaller than the true size.  i am taking a risk here but i am ordering another pair a size smaller trying to get a little compression in the fit.  this size isn\\'t compression fitting for me at all and that may not be possible with such a lightweight material.  if they end up being too small i\\'ll give them to my daughter. very cute pants. love them! these pants are exactly what i was looking for!<br />good fit but i could\\'ve got a small instead of medium<br />the first pair of loose pants trouser that are actually long enough for me from china. ordered 2 other pair from different sellers that was to short.<br />looks just like picture will go great with pumps or sandals :)<br />fast shipping ordered them april 9th got them today april 17th.<br /><br />i recommend these pants. very nice, but i am a size eight and i think this is for a size 4 maybe.  i\\'m giving it five stars for the price/quality combination -- the quality is good considering the low price glad i ordered them but thy were a little on the small side, not so small i can\\'t wear them.. do like the color and material... super comfy!!!!!! decent! wish they were made of a more breathable fabric, but they served the purpose i intended them to serve. fit just as i wanted good fabric all around a 1 i bought this mainly for the shorts and i knew i\\'d wear the top with other things but these shorts aren\\'t high waisted and the top is rather tight so if you\\'re a larger person i wouldn\\'t recommend this outfit for you. i am 5\\'6 120 lbs and i ordered a medium, i am pleased with the fit of the shorts, they sit comfortably on my hips and the pockets are cute as well; they\\'re not too short and too awkwardly long. i look forward to wearing them look very well made and terrific feel. i wear a 28, so that is what i ordered.  i wish i had taken time to read previous reviews...they do run small.  however, they feel great!  the fabric is very nice and soft.  as someone else said there pockets are for show only, there are none.  the seller was quick to respond for return. the color, the size are expected these are amazing and comfortable. somewhat small around the waistline. other than that, love the style and fabric. love  it ! its fresh good to wear wonderful to practise yoga or to used in a daily basis , in a normal day. the colour is amazing i´m very happy with the purchase i alway get xxl and they fit great. i\\'m  5\\' 8 1/2 &#34; & a size 14-16. i love this dress...it fits my simplicity. i am 5\\'7 and 11 8 lbs. i purchased a small and it\\'s sooo free and comfortable. i only don\\'t wear it on a busy day cos when i have to use the bathroom and all the hustle...i can\\'t stand it!!! they fit fine, just too long for a short person. they are comfortable and stretchy and perfect for petites. i am 5\\'3 and they fit just right. lindo le quedo muy bien a la nena. me gusto haberlo comprado. era lo que esperaba. la pr&oacute;xima vez compro once my daughter got the petite extra small, which fit her petite 5\\'2&#34; frame, she loved them.  we had to visit a uniform shop, where she did try on some other brands.  her comments were: the other brands were not as soft and they &#34;made her butt look too big!!- very baggy!  she now owns 6 pieces of the grey\\'s anatomy brand of scrubs and is ready to start vet school!! fit great!! love this brand of pants love these pants, i will be buying another one soon. the leggings fit, but barely.  they are not one size fits all, these are not &#34;bigger&#34; girl leggings.  the image is clear and you can\\'t see through them. i would buy leggings from this manufacturer again. family initially bought me a pair and i loved them so much i bought another two in different colors. the pocket is perfect for my keys and cell phone. very soft and absolutely pretty. i\\'m 5\\'2.5 and 126lbs. fits me perfectly. but slightly short. and in a place like michigan  where snow is heavy, i doubt it\\'s going too keep me warm when i go outside. i might wear fleece stockings inside it and snow boots  if i need to go out. these pants were perfect for the look i was going for. they are shinny, but i quite liked that. fit was perfect and i got so many complements! i am living for these pants! i\\'m 5\\'9&#34; and the length and fit is perfect for me. it\\'s hard to find pants for tall girls.  these are my favorite pants because there light weight jersey material and never wrinkle collect limpet, pile, or shrink!  i love how they hug me in all the right places.  about to order my third pair! absolutely love the pants! very comfortable, but fabric is kind of thin. they\\'re not kidding about running small. i ordered 2 sizes up and it was still a bit tight. very comfortable kinda short. i am 5\\'5 and they are a little bit like high waters on me. i received two pairs of these last year for my birthday from a speciality store.  the pants were over $80 each pair.  i was so thrilled to find these in another size for such a reasonable price.  the brand worn is so comfortable and looks terrific one. i really love these pants, they seem very comfortable.  i think they will be great to pack for vacationing.  i really like that the waist band can be worn high or scrunched down or rolled down (depending on the outfit).  the material is rather thin, so not great for new england winters, but thats not what i bought them for anyways.  i purchased the black - i  would think the other lighter colors would be see through.  they come un-hemmed and you are instructed to just cut them where you want them.  this is the only part i didn\\'t like....not sure if i was using lousy scissors, but the hem is a little choppy...i\\'ll have to figure that out. also, i normally wear size 8/10 and i ordered a large. these pants are so comfortable for the summer months to come. these pants and a solid color blouse will be a hit, i can\\'t believe how cool these pants are for a casual event. this should be a must have for summer. my daughter is 89-91lbs tiny frame and 5 feet 1 inch. the pants are about 2-3 inches too long for her (as expected). the waist fits her okay. worked well for what we used it for these are great.  i purchased a large 5\\'5&#34; 130#~they are a bit loose but i prefer them that way over too tight. very comfortable, part of new fall wardrobe love these uniforms!! :) they fit as expected perfect sizing they look great and are super comfortable. comfy, great size (i am a 5) great anti-slip, takes a long time till you get them these came to be the perfect size and all great comfy and does not pull only thing is the length these are meant to be worn with pumps or heels quality is outstanding. the leg is slightly baggy but nothing socks and a little bunching can\\'t solve! these are fabulous!  the blue bled into the white and red after washing but they still look great. i\\'m already receiving compliments on this pants.... exactly what i was looking for. it\\'s an ok cargo pant it\\'s great material for the price. it fit perfectly and i will buy more love these pants! i\\'m definitely buying more; they fit perfect and i love the color! hope the color lasts after washing .👌🏾 bought these for my wife when she complained about needing new black yoga pants. it\\'s been a month and she love them. she is either wearing them or they are in the laundry. love them! love these! lovely print... great fit... i would advise you to get a larger size if you are like me and want loose, comfy pajama pants! as i measure 1.83 meters the pants legs were a little bit short, but even short it looks good :)<br />i it as very confortable paint and i already started using it.<br />it is a very well made pants and i recommend it. love them! true to size and fit great love these pants!!! they are extremely soft and comfortable. i\\'ll be ordering more in different colors! they are perfect paired with heels or wedges. got this for my mom and she was happy. great summer pants. really happy with these pants. i purchased the navy in medium, in long. i believe petite was an option. yet they are perfect for my not quite 5 foot tall self.  the elastic waste band is a bit tight with the non-working fake draw strings. however i did manage to stretch it out a bit by pulling the waist band when not wearing them. now they are perfect! very comfortable, light pants, especially for summer!<br />i will buy more! highly recommend i love these leggings, they are in great condition, and they fit perfectly!  i was worried they\\'d be too short as i am 5\\'11, but they are perfect.  they also came like a month faster than predicted! love it! it was too small but i\\'m getting the next size up! the material of these leggings feels so good.  definitely need to wash them before wearing, as they came with a slight chemical smell.  i\\'ve only worn them once, so i\\'m not sure yet how they will stand up to washing and wearing,but i will update this review if i feel the quality lacks.<br /><br />otherwise, great fit and super comfy - i would order again! so fun and so comfortable. like yogs pants on a different level. i bought the neon green yoga pants & i got them within 3 days. way faster than i thought & they fit perfectly!!!!!!! i bought this for my sister. she wear this pants for yoga. she says that this design and color fits best for that purpose. i bought a medium sized pants for her. and this product is best because she can bend her legs more easily than wearing a track suit. the multicoloured-a1 was her choice. i\\'m glad that she loved this product. these are a must have pair of pants. i bought them in black and decided to order them in this color too!!! the fit is unbelievable, they are sooooo comfortable! they are like a dressy legging. well made and fit well. they\\'re long and i\\'m tall so it works. nice weight.wear them all the time.i\\'m 5\\'3 so they are a little long but good around the house. these pants are fit for real american women by the usa!!!  did i mention made in the usa!!!  these are my most favorite pants and i\\'ve only tried them on!  will def buy more! i love these pants and i don\\'t even work in the medical industry. i was just looking for soft cargo pants! i also love the waist. these are a super comfortable pant and run roomy. i\\'m a size 12 and i ordered a 12 tall and have plenty of room w a baggy fit which was just what i wanted! i normally wear a small, i\\'m 5\\' and 110 pounds and these were very small.  i\\'ll need a medium.  i have returned them and will order them in medium. i\\'d give many more stars if i could for these everlast pants!! and i so want more of these, one for each day i work out or simply am leisure in style. fits luxuriously & just right!!!!! frankly i\\'m shocked because my body type is hard to fit no matter what but these pants rock!!!!!:) i look and feel as good as the model!!! third pair i bought! i ordered one pair of charcoal gray just to see how they would fit & now have ordered one each of \\\\\\\\\"evening sand\\\\\\\\\" and light gray.  they are very soft and comfortable, just like a brushed cotton.  and i\\'m thrilled to finally find some comfortable pants that actually have a natural waist (i hate, hate, hate the \\\\\\\\\"modern\\\\\\\\\" roll-down hip huggers that are popular now).  these fit like pants should and are terrific for yoga, stretching, walking, and just hanging out around the house.<br /><br />i\\'m relatively short (5\\'4\\\\\\\\\") and so are these pants; they\\'re about an inch too short for me to wear in public, but they are perfect for knocking around the house barefoot.  the waistband is a wide elastic that\\'s very comfortable and not overly-binding.  the legs are flatteringly wide (not a tapered leg), so if you\\'re a shortie like me, these give the illusion of more height.  stitching and finishing are excellent; there\\'s a nice notched accent at the cuff; really cute--these are my favorite \\\\\\\\\"comforters\\\\\\\\\" and they\\'re very flattering for a casual pant.  exceeded my expectations; highly recommended! i really loved the these pants for my daughter. they were a perfect fit! she also loved  them. i would highly recommend them to any parent who\\'s daughter has to kaki wear uniform clothes. i received a different pair than what i ordered, but they are still galaxy and i still love them, so they can still get 4 stars. they are thick and warm and soft, they get all of the attention when i wear them. i wore these pants across europe and they were perfect. very comfortable, fit as expected and lasted 10+ miles a day for a month. you can hide stuff in them and it\\'s harder for pick pockets to get at you. definitely felt like olivia dunham from fringe everywhere i went as well, which makes them even cooler. apparently husbands don\\'t like cargo pants, but skinny jeans and stilettos aren\\'t always an option are they? red hanger women\\'s high waist slinky palazzo pants regular and plus sizes  for review<br /><br />i need to say this was a item for my wife, the pants fit her perfect but i noticed that i could see thru the material; i only say this because some ladies don\\'t like that but i can tell you from a mans point ohh we like it, just not on our wives. i just want to be with her when she does wear them because i love to see my wife, and that just spices it up a little, but yes consider that issue when buying. as far as looks go awesome ; the wife compliments them very well and they fit like a glove. i inspected these pants and tried them on right out of the packaging and i love them! i have no complaints. i like the material and they stretch! i also like the fact that the leg openings are skinny so they fit perfectly (comfortable) while wearing boots. very comfortable love the fit and the feel. love these scrubs, they fade quickly i love it it is exactly what its says it is and it fits great. they was nice but i couldn\\'t fit them. i tried returning them but ended up returning a pair of jeans by accident. so could the seller please contact me so i can get the item i sent to you by accident. i would really appreciate it. these are cute but thicker material than i thought. they run at least a size smaller! i wear an eight and these fit like a 6. these pants are comfortable, slimming and stylish i would like more of them. they arrived on time and looked exactly as described. i love these and want another pair love, love, love these. they are long but can be trimmed with sharp scissors. raw edge isn\\'t a problem. i love this romper!!!! it not only fits great, but color is beautiful and soft. i used it for mothers day to just walk around and be lazy, and my husband just kept admiring how great i looked.<br /><br />thanks i bought these as a holiday gift for my daughter.  they wash well, with no shrinkage or discoloration. they are a good value for the money and run true to size nice pants very soft fabric. i love it i love these pants! they run a little big with the size 6, but that\\'s perfectly fine. i don\\'t wanna risk a size too small. i\\'m buying another pair. i wore the ones i got yesterday to work. best cargo pants i have ever had! these pants are great, especially for the cost! i am 5.5 months pregnant, 5\\'5&#34; tall, and probably approx 170 lbs by now. the size large fits me perfectly and definitely have room to wear for a few more months, if not all the way through the rest of my pregnancy. they look pretty much exactly like the photo - a bit tighter in the thigh area, and flaring out a bit down toward the calves and ankles. a good amount of stretch while looking a bit nicer than the usual exercise/yoga pants. these will make a great addition to my work wardrobe! love my pants!! down side the are a bit long and kinda big. i wear a large in everything (just about) and i\\'m 5\\'2. she loves them excellent fit ,exactly what she wanted i choice this rate because fixed  excellent in the body of my wife, i loved thank you for every thing these are so soft and comfortable plus they do not add bulk to your figure like some sweat pants.  i am 5\\'9 and the length is perfect, i normally wear a 33 inseam. these also wash well and have remained crisp white after 4 washings. i love these!! they\\'re comfortable they fit perfectly.  looks exactly like the picture. these workout pants fit great and look great also. i feel that when you purchase stylish exercise clothing and enjoy the look, it makes you work just that much harder. review and adjust the sizes, and review the guide table according to the sizes used in different countries, to prevent changes. very nice scrubs. wash great! 3rd pair. nice fabric, dries quick. so many compliments at the gym. a real deal for the price! sure will be buying more the quality is amazing and the fit is great! has a glossy rayon finish, and stretches like a charm! really like these -- very comfortable and love the styling i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; and 162 lbs now, and i have thicker thighs, so i got a large. when i received the pants, the material felt rough, but they did soften after washing them. the pants actually felt just right, almost on the tighter side, so i thought these are not going to last when i get even further along in my pregnancy! however, they do loosen up when you wear them and start to feel perfect as the day goes by. i do really like them, especially for the price and comfort. nice gf loves these. love love these pants. they came earlier than expected and fit great. comfy fit as if i am not wearing anything. i just had a baby and they are very forgiving around the waist and kind of hold that area in in a comfortable way-i got the elephants and the peacock feathers print and they look beautiful- good quality! look nice, the only thing is that they are not low raise as it look like in the picture the are really high wash well very comfortable lounge pant love these. just wish the stitching was slightly stronger. was able to fix rip myself and also bought a 2nd pair. fast delivery better than the picture good quality product for price. i added some bling with iron on gems and it will make a holiday gift for my daughter. thank you! great design and quality - wore it to my first musical festival and was extremely comfortable. wish it came in more colors! one has a seam not sewn for about 2 inches, the appears to not have any elastic, wont stay up. perfect fit otherwise. these pants are great. they have an even stripe, which many don\\'t. they have a very good fit and the fabric is wonderful. there great but that\\'s what betty boop always is. i love the angel/devil combination. very comfortable. very impressed.  this fits perfect and is as cute as can be! love these..fit is great and they are very comfy. very cute and comfy!! great product.  length was a little too long.  but love the comfort and price excelent this is really cute it doesn\\'t stretch as much but it is still nice i would recommend it but i would say get a size bigger love it. great fit. although the pants were for me too large, the seller has excellant service! i was refunded full amount. thank you very much! the quality is very good and the style, just buy smaller size and everything will be ok. reccomend the seller, very careful and gentle. great as expected, great colors very vibrant. perfect fit can\\'t wait to wear with my boots thank you a lot will shop again soon i was looking for a cheaper yoga pant that compared with the victoria\\'s secret ones i\\'ve fallen in love with. these fit the same and are super comfy. but they are more see through than the previous reviews led me to believe. if you bend over, everyone will know what type of underwear you are (or aren\\'t) wearing. other than that, great product, good color selection, and would order again. so comfy!!!!!!! do buy! i will be buying more!!!!! love cute linen capris. linen can be a little rough so keep that in mind  - though they will soften after a couple washes. great fit and quality great outfit. they only had an x-small left but decided to give it a try as i typically wear medium. it fit perfectly! i would say it runs large so order a size or two down. pants fit perfectly  wish they were a little heavier very comfortable i really like these pants. they are perfect for my workplace, which has a career casual dress code. do order a size larger than you think you will need, because they run small. i normally wear a size 12 jeans and the xxl in these are snug. they are comfy and lightweight, so even in this california heat, i\\'m not sweltering. i purchased these pants at a reduced price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. cute for the price, good quality but heads up, runs small. i am a size 6 and it fits perfectly. if you are a larger size you may not be comfortable in this. nice pants very comfortable. exactly what i was looking for. i love them! super comfy! they are a little longer than i expected. they pull up on my stomach or fold over comfortably either way. i\\'m definitely happy i ordered them. these are just as good, and wayyyyy cuter! my boyfriend says they make my butt look awesome too. jeggings, best invention since the push up bra. this run a bit big but it\\'s still really cute on these are really well tailored for the female form. back zipper and small front pocket. these corduroys are rethought in their design. balances your proportions. two things i would want changed are the silver zipper on the back (it would have been nicer if it were white) and beige colored lining in the pocket versus white so the pocket lining doesn\\'t visually pop out as much. the corduroy is soft and these have a much nicer line than what i have seen at j. crew and gap. chic and affordable. love it!! its what i expected this is a nice quality snow pants. it has an enjoyable warm second layer. had question about the size and contacted seller, got response quickly and had issue resolved properly. i\\'m 5\\'6&#34;/130 lbs and the small fits perfectly. it\\'s casual and comfy, but still cute - perfect for hot weather. these pants have a great drape in person.  also i am 5\\'10&#34; and ordered the xl for the length.  they show a little more of the ankle so they don\\'t seam as overwhelming as the photo shows.  they look very nice with a hi low tank and sandals now and birkenstock clogs and a sweater tunic come fall time.  the linen is a nice heavier weight and not at all see through.  another quality piece from this company.  i really recommend this company.  customer service is top notch and the pieces i\\'ve ordered arrive very quickly. great value and my wife loves them! thanks to amazon and my prime membership, i aldo got free 2-day shipping... you can\\'t beat that with a stick! the size on the pants states they are a large but they are obviously a junior large and they come no where close to fitting me.  a large is usually too big on me but i buy large so if they shrink they will fit comfortably.  i was very disappointed at how tiny these pants looked when i opened my package and even more disappointed when i tried them on and they didn\\'t even come up past my knees. this was the 1st time i have ever purchased any clothing item offline and honestly i am very satisfied! i purchased a large in black to wear to a wedding and i got many compliments on them. i am 5\\'9&#34; tall and honestly a little chunky and they are the prefect length, they come to my ankles and are very stretchy, i would recommend hanging them to dry though because it will help keep the legs longer due the material being a lot heavier when wet. great buy, thinking about getting another pair so i can wear them more often, and with more colors. definitely use the size chart they have listed in the description it lead me to the perfect fit and there were no panty lines showing either. i love these pants! great for summer because the fabric is thin and very breathable. fun print! these cords are fabulous! great fit for a great price! the only thing -and i mean only thing!- i would change is the silver zipper. maybe a black zipper would be less obvious. of course i plan to wear my cords with the coordinating jacket so no worries of the silver zipper being seen! it would be nice to wear the pants sans jacket at times, though.    all in all, great product and a super value!       keep making your wonderful designs for target, isaac! we love them and love you for making them! was very happy with how quick my items got to my house. my girlfriend was super happy with items! they look great on her! got them as a gift for my 15 year old daughter and she loves them. as other reviewers wrote, these run a size larger than normal. so i ordered the next size down and they fit great. and super comfortable! love the flared leg, it\\'s not too much. i just ordered a second pair!! my wife\\'s behind is very well represented with this pair of yoga pants. i think she should wear these all the time. i am one lucky guy ;^) for this to be a small, it\\'s too large. i\\'m 5\\'2&#34;, 105 lbs, and these are baggy in the arse and hip area, although perfect in the calf region... and i have a decent arse so it ain\\'t me. if they fit i would love them. still hot, got compliments when i wore them. these scrub pants are the best fit i have found. most scrub pants are too big & the legs are too wide. the koi skinny pants are just right. perfect for camping in the cold and skiing. not very long but large size otherwise these are super cute and fit perfectly. very warm in our cold winters. i purchased several pairs and very pleased with them. keep their color when washed and don\\'t lose their shape. bought this for an elderly person who needs pants that are easy to put on and easy to launder.  these appear to be both.  she\\'s very happy with them. i have a hard time finding pants that fits me correctly. these are perfect. they\\'re souper cute and comfortable, and look just like how they were advertised. they seem a little cheaply made, but not too bad. perfect!  i use size large but i been loosing some weight so i check in the size chart and i order size medium wich is between 8/10 and they fit just perfect . i cant wait to order more! beautiful, lite, comfy. i ordered xl and i\\'m 5\\'10&#34;, 225, and they\\'re just a little bit tight.... i\\'ve gotta lose a few lbs anyways :-p delivery was excellent! 2 days. going to order another pair! i received the package on time. it was just as described. the pants are incredibly soft and do not wrinkle at all. great nice look. love the feel of the material. the size is perfect. i\\'m 5\\'1 so i had to have them hemmed, alittle too long. loved them! awesome leggings, held up to running several 5k\\'s and glow in the dark paint!  great for an 80\\'s party or run! super cute. a little tight after you first get them out of the wash but they loosen up a little as you wear them. soft & comfy. i got every color of these pants that were in my size. i love the legging feel but with the thicker texture. i don\\'t know how they will fit after a wash but i do not think they will strink too much. the colors are very bright and vibrant. i hope it doesn\\'t fade when washing. make sure to wash on cold and air dry if possible. i am happy!! i like the imitation leather part in the front, and the ponte material in the back. warm pants. i would recommend trying them. you can dress them up, or go very casual. quality, the fit, just wonderful!  i am super happy!  arrived sooner than expected since these were coming from another country, great experience, thank you! i really do enjoy these pants, they are very soft and silky to the touch. they are lightweight, breathable and slimming without being constricting. my biggest concern was the fabric, however you can see no panty lines through there and it\\'s not so thin that you can see outlines at all. quality material without being too bulky in the heat of the summer is a perfect mix. i\\'m 5\\'11 with very thick thighs so these were a bit high for me, so i had to adjust them occasionally. i paired them with a blazer and heels and it was perfectly work chic and then threw a tank top on underneath for yoga. these have no spandex in them really so if you\\'re looking for something to cling to you, these really aren\\'t it so check your measurements before ordering. i have no other qualms about these and i highly recommend them.<br /><br />i received this at a discount in exchange for a review. wonderfuly made, just too snug in bust and i have long legs. usually wear size 2 pants and small tops. i\\'ll be ordering a small next time. i was a little apprehensive getting these bell bottom pants, but they are seriously very cute!!! i am 34, 5\\'5&#34; and around 135 lbs so i ordered a medium and they fit perfectly! as i was strutting around my house, one of my 12 year old daughters stopped me and started raving about how much she loved them so i changed and let her try them on. she is almost as tall as me, but way skinnier and they fit her perfectly as well. i promised to share them with her so she is beyond thrilled.<br /><br />since these are a little long, i prefer to wear my wedges and the pants fall just above the ground. the material is a bit thin which is great for keeping cool, but i do recommend wearing a natural colored undergarment as my pink lace showed through a bit. i did have to really look, but i would rather be safe then embarrassed later. all of the seams appear to be sewn very well and if you need to, the bottom could easily be hemmed up a little to reach your perfect length. i have worn and washed these a couple of times with a regular load of clothes (no zippers!) and have only positive experiences.<br /><br />i am very pleased with the quality and comfort of the bell bottoms. i received this pair for free to test out and provide my honest feedback. most comfortable pants i own i love this style i\\'m crazy about these pants they look too small in the waist but i can work with that the sweatpants were of high quality potl this product is great quality and supper comfortable, but i\\'m giving it 4 starts because its way too small, i ordered a large due to the previous review knowing i\\'m a size small 5\\'2 and 102 pounds. so unless your supper thin (model body) than this can work as size large. other than that, these pants are supper cute. sadly, will have to return. very nice why didn\\'t i discover these years ago!!  i love them!  i thought they\\'d be too big since i had to order xl instead of a l, my normal size.  however, they fit perfectly.  i like that they are a soft cotton.  they are soooooo comfortable under a dress or skirt. super comfy, nice length, wash well! really like these pants and have ordered in several colors.  even though they are hemmed i just cut them off a bit without re-hemming, since they are very long, and i usually have a hard time finding jeans long enough for me.  really comfortable,  can use just for around house or with a nice top and shoes, dress them up to go out. these have become my favorite workout pants!! i know they are cheap but the quality is excellent. i have bought cheaply made pants which seem great only for them to rip at the seams. these amazingly didn\\'t, very stretchy,  and comfortable. highly recommend. will definitely be buying more in different colors!! these are the best pants ever! they are incredibly comfortable but don\\'t look like pajamas. the print is rich and trendily elegant. flattering fit. i wear them to work & they look good as well as are super comfy.  i\\'m gonna buy more. was happy with my order great purchase. pants were affordable and sturdy i\\'m always hesitant to order clothes on amazon, especially in asian sizing since americans are usually larger and proportioned differently.  i\\'m happy to report that these leggings come in standard us sizes (s, m, l, xl) and fit perfectly.  our college age daughter loved the black geometric pattern and the silky softness of the polyester/spandex fabric.  they are closely fitted from waist to ankle without any bagging or sagging, and the waistline comes to just under her navel.  she wore them to class one day this week, and got lots of compliments on them.  and even after a day of sitting, standing and walking, they still fit flatteringly.<br /><br />these leggings come in three different patterns/colors and look great with boots and a skirt, or with a long sweater and ballet flats.  they\\'re priced very competitively and compared to the fit of some leggings she bought from walmart, these are a much nicer fabric.<br /><br />i received a complimentary set of leggings for testing and review purposes.  i wasn\\'t asked to leave a positive review, nor was i compensated in any way for giving my honest opinion of this product. fabric is kind of thin, but they fit! they are awesome thanks! perfect fit, good quality, love them! was as advertised. great ski pants, but a bit snug in the butt!  5\\'6\\' 140lbs ordered the m- usa way to long love the fit i have enjoyed wearing these palazzo pants! i would order again!!!! just a little long over all i really like them! i purchased these a gift and the recipient was super excited when she unwrapped them. they looked fleecy/fuzzy, but were actually a light cotton. if i had read that, i would\\'ve purchased a larger size for the length, as they will probably shrink quite a bit. great fit these are great! these pants truly go with anything! i have bought several pairs over the years, the dark black color never fades, can be worn for dress up or dress down. i love these pants! they feel nice and came in as expected. very happy with purchase. this fits me pperfect.  i am 5\\'3 medium build. looks exactly as shown i love the material and the leggings in general but, i definitely should have ordered a size smaller. i wear a medium in everything. except these apparently. i am 5\\'4&#34;, 130lbs. the mediums fit just okay. smalls would have been much better. absolutely love these pants! the quality is great and so is the fit. the pants are extremely cute and comfortable. every time i wear them i get compliments on them!! plan to buy more of these love these scrubs! great fit, quality fabric and very soft!  i bought the longs and just wish they were longer! the leggings are so beautiful and very comfortable to winter time the delivery was very fast just a time for cool weather these pants are great!  i read all the reviews and had a good idea what size to order.  just to help, i\\'m 5\\'9 and 165 lbs.  i ordered the l pants and they are plenty long.  i can roll the high waist over and still step on the bottoms.  they will work great with a bit of a heel.  hope this helps.  i will be ordering another pair.  they were better than i hoped for.  i expected it, but the fabric is super thin, like other flowy clothing, so i\\'d be leary of lighter colored ones.  cheers! i love them, my butt looks amazing! i really like them but i was reading that they ran small so i bought a large generally i\\'m a medium(us) size 4 in jeans.  and they actually fit a bit too big for me :/ but i\\'d still wear them i absolutely love these pants! they are even better looking than the pictures and the colors are great! the material is light, soft, and somewhat silky, providing a very comfortable and breathable fit, perfect for summer! i wore them out running errands today, and received three separate compliments from people, asking where i had gotten them. needless to say i will be ordering more! also,  i feel that it is worth noting that you can also hike the legs up to above your calves, turning them into adorable capris as well. :) very nice cut but the waist was a little small. i will still use them. the quality is great! i bought these for my teen daughter.  she said that they are comfortable and wears them around the house.  the material is kind of thin, so i hope they will keep their shape and hold up with use.  overall, i think they are average for the money. the fabric is a bit thin and i am not thrilled with the tie on the front and they are a bit tight in the crotch area.  having said all that, i do like them and they don\\'t hang all over the floor.  i am short. 5\\'2&#34; and a lot of these pants are just ridiculously long.  reading the reviews helped me make the purchase because other people my size found them acceptable. these pants are wonderful. i wear them in the gym or with boots or like leggings,they are very comfortable and flattering. i will buy another one full length soon. extremely comfortable and good looking. the quality seems nice, it actually exceeded my expectations for the price, and they have not ripped so far. totally recommended it is just like the picture shows.. ordered for my daughter too short for her fits me perfect. very cute arrived before expected these scrubs are comfy and look really good on! i don\\'t really trust buying clothes, especially pants, online. i took a chance & i like them! they are a good fit very comfortable. but just a little large than expected. confortable we ship a lot of amazon items to our office, so i picked up some of the tan pants for my colleague who\\'s pregnant.  she loves them and is going back to order the other colors. love the fit and color.  i usually wear mediums in pants, but in the koi, i wear a large.  love all the pockets. these pants look and feel like they are much more expensive yoga pants. i love that i got them for a great value. this pant runs big. ordered my usual size and it was a whole size too big. very generous fit. otherwise, it\\'s a nice, comfortable pant. i bought a pair in black and they looked so good over my swim suit i also bought them in pink too! fits good. i like the sara and the lindsey pants, but these are even better.  i ordered the small tall- i am 5\\'8&#34; and 140 lbs and they fit perfectly. i like it, it\\'s a bit more green than in picture. but other than that it\\'s just like picture. very pretty and fun.  i ordered a large and they fit perfectly.  i generally wear a size 6. these pants could work well for a variety of heights, depending on where you set the pants on your hips. the fabric is light, so neutral undies recommended. i bought these to wear on a long flight for cute comfort that isn\\'t pajamas. very comfy love them....fit great, so comfy. i am tall, 5\\'9&#34; inches and they were long even for me, could hem them higher an inch maybe.  but love them. i am trying to get a fellow swole sister to lift more. she mainly does cardio. anyways this was a christmas gift to her and she loved it. took awhile for shipping but for the price you can\\'t go wrong. love the fabric. they fit just a touch too baggy which takes some getting used to. the fit is good.  the fabric has a good feel to it.  i wish the legs, at the bottom, were a little wider, but generally, i\\'m very satisfied. super fun and comfy pants! love the vivid colors! arrived very quickly, but then again i live in la! famtastic! i am 5\\'6 size 10. they are a size large and a bit baggy but i like that. they are extremely well made and unbelievable for 10 bucks! so cozy and yet perfect for the office. i will be ordering these again! i love my pants they run 3 sizes smaller they sent me the wrong size which work out perfect, the shinny buttons add just the right amount of bling. i have washed them several times on gently cycle then air dry.  holding up nicely. love the pants, didn\\'t fit.contacted the seller and they were so awesome and worked with me. i would difinitely recommend seller and purchase from them in the future love these pants,very. comfortable like everything about this item, but runs a little small...will order a large next time worked perfect for what we needed them for. good quality! perfect fit. i will order more often from this vendor. for the price i can dress them up and make them look classy the belt is cheap looking but doesn\\'t really matter to me. order at least one size up. print and material are beautiful. the cut and style make this one cute suit ;) would totally get another pair, very nice booty, great if you wanna have a good date night ;), feels like i\\'m in the 80\\'s my step daughter enjoyed them i\\'m impressed by these - i ordered the small and the fit is great. the color is super-saturated, glorious crayon-box purple. as with most stretchy pants, the waist is a bit of a problem for me... instant plumber\\'s crack when i bend over. but a belt will solve that problem. i was leery of buying yoga pants online after reading mixed reviews of many others that people were receiving them and they were too long. the description for these says that the inseam is 31inches for a small and that was perfect for my 5\\'3&#34; self. they came just as i expected. i was also worried that they would be thin see through material like so many others were saying but i\\'m here to tell you they are not! those people may just be wearing the wrong size and they are stretched to the max then because the black pair that i received is actually decently thick, especially for being so cheap!the only reason i am not giving these 5 stars is because they are a bit more of a high rise waist than i expected or like for yoga pants. also, they are not flare leg like described, definitely more of a straight leg fit. none the less, for the price, they are great!. very well pleased  with this pair. looks great fits great and is very comfortable to work out in<br />love the colour and pattern and especially the fact that i do not have to keep pulling up the pants they run a bit small. i love the color an the material. only 1 problem, the sizes run extremly small. but other than that they are nice. love these! these pants are soft and sturdy, but very lightweight.  they come down to my knees, and the elastic around the legs isn\\'t too tight.  i use them for yoga and zumba, and i haven\\'t had a single problem with them.  i bought five pairs, but if i needed more,  i would definitely buy them again. fits great it fits great, i love it. i quite often wear large, but can also wear medium and this fit perfectly.  very comfortable and looks great. it fits nicely and it\\'s very comfy. but i\\'m not sure if i would call it &#34;dress pants&#34; it\\'s more like a thick leggings in terms of how it\\'s right and you can pretty much see the shape of your body very clearly. i must say please dont say one size fit all because its not true apart from that<br />it is ok it will be nice for spring/summer. fits well and will look very stylish with a nice pair of sandals. feels very comfortable. so i wear them.  because they fit.<br /><br />the fabric and quality are fine too. these are great for a costume, or just being that bizarre person like me. i\\'m a size 1, and these fit me perfectly, but any more loose and they wouldn\\'t be tights anymore. so anyone who isn\\'t as lucky as me in the size department will still find these wearable. the material is just as sleek as it appears in the image, it\\'s not itchy, but smooth.<br />they also took around 7 business days to ship, amazon says 17 minimum. so expect them to be delivered at an appropriate and more reasonable date. im 5\\'4&#34; 150lbs. i ordered a large and it fits well. a tad long, but most stuff is on me. vwry soft and comfy, good quality material. very cute top but runs small. i bought one pair for my 13 year old daughter. she loves them so much and wears them all the time, i just went and bought her 3 more pairs as a surprise.  the price is good, and the quality is good. she\\'s going to be so excited. 13 year old daughter loves these, she\\'s very tall so they aren\\'t too long. standing up to the teen wear and tear nicely. would order again. this is the first time i\\'ve ordered a pair of scrubs pants on line that actualy fit to the tee. i love the style and all the pockets it has on them; that\\'s the way i like my scrubs to be with alot of pockets and yes i will tell my friends about this web-site. i also like the slit on the leg also. my daughter loves these pants. these are definitely tall! i\\'m 5\\'6, and i have plenty of leg room, and slack at the ankles as well. i\\'d recommend going down a size for these, as i picked up a 5x and they\\'re very roomy. i love cat\\'s so much,  and as an atheist the upside down cross was just another expression of myself :) i can not be more pleased with this product! came a bit early and i can\\'t wait to wear them. these pants are nice material! they are soft, smooth, flexible and all around comfy! i love the pockets and the drawstring. the bottom of the pant legs are looser than pictured, i personally prefer them to be more fitted. same with the pant legs, they are not as fitted as they look in the picture. i bought the wrong size, could do with how loose they are in the leg, and i would buy a smaller size but i found something else that better suits me. shipping is really fast, it shipped to me by standard shipping in 2 days. the seller is fast with responses. great service as well! also, if you\\'re going by the size chart, go by the pant size. i followed the waist and hip size and it ended up being way too big. i like the color and material.  i have use it in yoga classes.  very easy to move do the yoga poses in it. i will recommend to my friends the pants were small but if you read the reviews you can figure out if you order a size or two big ( based on american sizing) you can get it right. the pants i recieced were damaged but the seller did a great job communicating with me and providing me a refund great scrub bottoms. i am 5\\' 2 1/2&#34; tall & these fit pretty perfect for length. and at 120-125lbs, the small fits great! good quality. pricey so hoping they last. i really think they will. dressy, casual and comfortable!! i absolutely love hatley products.  i have aprons, coffee cups, tees, etc.  this is the first pair of pj bottoms i have ordered from hatley.  i am 5\\'7&#34; tall and weigh in at 145, wearing an average size 6 tall, or 8 tall, as all of my height is in my legs.  i ordered a large in the pj bottoms, as i like my pj\\'s long and loose.  the length on the size large is more than generous, which i love; however, the size runs very slim through the hips and thighs; more for a teen build than a woman\\'s curvy figure.  typically, a large equates to a size 10 - 12, sometimes even a 14.  this pj in a large is much closer to a size 6 or 8.  they still fit, but if they shrunk at all, they would be too snug.  as such, i have to wash them in cold and then let them hang dry, so it is a good thing they are so soft and adorable!  unless you like your pjs snug, order a couple of sizes larger than your true size.  there was also a slight 2&#34; seam on the leg that had been missed in the sewing; no biggie, i just got a needle and thread and whipped it up! over all?  love them! i have never gotten so many compliments on pants. apparently they are rather complimentary to an athletic rear. anyway, they fit great and feel comfortable. very colorful and fit well if you are a size 6 or 8, which i am.  i am 5\\'5&#34; and they are not too long for me with a normal size heel.  look just like the photo.  perfect for a 60\\'s or 70\\'s party! these are a bit long (i\\'m 5\\'6&#34;) and i wish i knew how to hem them rather than cut off the bottom fabric. goes good for wearing other things instead of biking shorts while riding bikes i love the leggings thank you i am very happy with the product i love them! i was so tired of nursing scrubs fitting me all boxy and looking boyish. these scrubs fit me perfectly and made me look so much more womanly. i love them! i\\'m 122 pounds, 5\\'3 and  i bought the black in large, nice fit. i like these lounge pants mostly because it has cartman all over it. they are a little baggy though. as soon as i put these on i bought a second pair. very soft, comfy and stay up!! i\\'m in love they were the perfect fit for my girlfriends birthday. she loved them and they came right on time.i still think they look like karate pants, but they are comfortable according to my girlfriend i read the reviews and decided to order the medium size. i\\'m 6 foot with 37 inch hips and rarely don\\'t have high water pants, but these babies are actually long enough! they\\'re nice and long, form fitting, and definitely make me feel sexy. they are extremely comfy and i haven\\'t even washed them yet. i normally have to throw any new clothes straight into the wash, but these are super soft. i will say that these are not seamless, so if you\\'re going for that sexy sheer look, then you might want to consider seamless. i love these though, i might have to buy them in some more colors :) they are nice and dark (a good true black).  they have a  slight sheen to them, they are not very thick, i\\'m a plus size lady so i only intended to wear them with a tunic so the fact that they are snug in the waste and hips doesn\\'t bother me.  i\\'m 5\\'9&#34; tall and i usually have a hard time finding pants or dresses or skirts that are long enough, but these pants are long!  i would say they are at least 3&#34; too long.  i\\'m trying to decide whether i should cut them off and hem them or just cut them off and leave them.  the reason i might not hem them is because sometimes when sewing this type of stretchy fabric it can be tough to not have it gather or pucker and i want it to flow and stay as wide as it\\'s supposed to be.  i got them about 6 weeks ago and only wore them once for a couple of hours but took them off because they were driving me crazy that they were that long.  i just need to cut or hem them so i can start wearing them again.  i would rather have pants longer than shorter because you can hem / cut them but you can\\'t add length to them. roomy & nice material and nice patterns  very pleased this is the second that i bought because my daughter love it. love love the color and length like the wine color. goes with the blouse/jacket i ordered it for. fits comfortably. really pretty pants! all the designs make them really stylish and cool. i\\'ve worn them a couple of times so far and they have given me a lot of compliments. although, there are swastika\\'s on multiple places on the pants. but the pants are overall really neat. i love it it is perfect! love the color and the way it fits! first time scrub pants have ever fitted properly. loved it i got these for my walking/exercise pants but they are so comfortable and lovely they can be worn with nice tops and evenings out too  wash well, the type that is wonderful to pack since they don\\'t wrinkle either.  .i plan to get more like these in the future. looks like short pants on me (i\\'m 5\\'3&#34;) but great otherwise. i bought a small, and it was too big around the waist and longer that i expected. (im 5\\'3 140lbs, waist 28inch) however the drawstring allows for tighter pants. the extra pockets are nice too! love these pj\\'s - great quality - soft fleece and high quality waist band - the elastic is made into the waist and does not twist up inside the waist band like others.  love the junior fit - does not sit too high on the waist.  i am about to order another pair! they look a little funny on but that\\'s what harrub pants are made to look like it makes me want to listen to mc hammer for sure i kind of love these love these pants. i usually wear a size 4 (us) and the medium fit perfectly. it was a bit snug when i first put it on, but within minutes, it conformed to my body. breathable, flexible and comfortable. great fit! nice fitting and comfy these pants are very comfortable plus they feel like a better quality fabric then what i am accustomed to. i bought the x-tra large size because i am a tall woman ( 6 feet), and believe it or not, they actually longer then i expected. a much better clothing product then what i usually buy, i usually buy my clothing at discount stores, like wal-mart.i recommend this product to anyone with a twisted sense of humor awesomely comfortable pants; i absolutely love them. fit perfectly and are very snuggly. i\\'ll probably purchase more of these in a different color. i like them a lot. however they do start to sheer if you wear them a lot like i do. they probably would fit better too for skinny people without a huge butt like i do, otherwise i would had been comfortable in a medium. very nice thanks you these pants are very flattering and the fabric is comfortable and forgiving. i wear them with the tech jacket often and it makes a very hip ensemble. i wear a size 10 and have a lot of &amp;quot;junk in my trunk&amp;quot; but the back doesn\\'t gape at all which is a plus. i recieve compliments on these pants every time i wear them. buy these pants before they run out!! i have worn these jeans for the last three years and love them.. they are the only jeans i buy anymore.. very comfortable and long. very nice made of nice materials, tailoring is superb. they fit very well. i highly recommend those leggings nice color, nice fit and different from everything else i see around;)  wore them immediately and wait to wear again. these are very nice but a bit small. i have a bit of a big butt so the don\\'t like to stay up. i should of gotten a biger size but other then that they are perfect~! i just got these pants and they are great, good quality. i am 5\\'6\\' and ordered a medium, they are about an inch too long so i  may have to hem them but they are totally worth the price. happy i found them in the usa, so i didn\\'t have to wait for them to ship from china! fit me perfectly (i usually wear a s/m legging). opaque. i pulled them out and thought they were a little too sheer to be worn as the traditional legging (maybe have to wear them as tights instead) but they are fine on. when i slipped my foot into the ankle hole, i was worried that they would be far too tight but they were\\'nt.they are a little bit short for my frame but with boots, leggings, or high socks, that can be taken care of.<br />they fit me perfectly!<br />but a big warning: they say &#34;one size&#34; but i highly doubt that\\'s true. i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; and 105 pounds and they juuust fit me. there isn\\'t a lot of stretch at all especially at the ankles so if you have a curvier lower half of your body, these are likely to be too tight (which could cause them to rip due to the nature of the fabric) or not fit at all. i get so so many compliments on these pants and they are super comfy. i am ordering 2 more pairs in different colors. i am a size 9/10 and 29-31&#34; waist and the medium fit perfect. they are super long for women of any height and are easy to cut/trim to fit. i always struggle with finding pants that fit right.  i need a short size, and these fit perfectly.  they are comfortable, and the price is right.  i wanted to make sure i had a couple of extras in case i don\\'t get laundry done on time. nice absolutely perfect!!!  they are exactly what i was hoping for!!  i ordered an additional 3 pair and may order more.  the skirt is just long enough to provide the look i wanted.  they are soft, fit well at the knee and have the perfect amount of flair.  they are also nice and long for those of you with longer legs. i am so happy i found these!!  i train at the gym, but i also dance.  these are perfect for both. nice fit. comfy but thin enough to wear to work under my slacks. love them! great fit! great pair of shorts for the price. they get the job done and help keep me from being too sore. the padding is a little large though. makes you look extra ridiculous. i bought this for a cosplay outfit i\\'m putting together.  the pants for well for 3x.  i wear pants size 3x (26) because i have a large belly.  this will work for my cosplay, though i wouldn\\'t likely wear it for anything too active, the material is especially thin, and wouldn\\'t keep me warm in cold weather, might not hold up to lots of thigh rubbing during exercise, and while it isn\\'t noticeably see through in my house, i won\\'t be wearing light underwear beneath it, just in case. took a while but they are cute great pair of lacy shorts, super comfy. fit is great and very sexy to boot! fast and as described i would buy them again. good product i love these pants. quality is good, color is brilliant, fit is comfortable and roomy. only ordered one pair to make sure of the product quality and fit and  i will definitely be ordering multiple pairs next order as they do take some time to arrive being they come from thailand. definitely worth the wait!! i was concered the one size would be too small but its perfect i am very happy the green was a little darker than i expected not as bright but i still love the jeans.  they are a snug fit. nice and soft. loved it. was hoping for the shiny rayon material, not a cotton blend type. because the more it is a cotton type the more it hugs my imperfections. runs on the small side but my daughter is tiny so it worked out well for us.we ordered a size small and it it fits like a size 00/0. made of durable, but also soft and comfortable material. colors always bright and true to pictures, and don\\'t fade in the wash. wish the price was lower, but worth it for sure. also love that it has a functional tie as well as belt loops in case the tie isn\\'t enough. plenty of pockets and room for gear. love it love very nice and good quality this is all i wear, yoga pants in whatever colors i can find. nice, light weight and comfortable. want more color choices. great pants! theyre comfortable and absolutely beautiful pants. im 5\\'1 and it goes probably 5 or 6 inches above my ankle ! ok wish we could get it in a tall as they are great pants, but have a standard inseam. i love the pants.  they fit exactly like i expected and are extremely comfortable in the muggy weather. they wash in cold by hand and hang dry. they dry very quickly.  they were delivered much quicker than expected which was a bonus!  definitely worth it! i ordered a 16 bit i could have gotten a 14 it fits great to my shape thou. i ❤️it they are large, especially in the waist. but i believe they will shrink when washed to be just the right size. love it love them absolutely love these leopard trousers. they fit perfect and super comfortable. i am 5\\'3&#34; and when i tried them on they were about 2&#34; too long.  after washing and drying on medium in the dryer they are still long but at least an inch shorter and wearable.<br />very comfortable! this came fast, correctly packaged and great fit. they were just what i was wanting and expecting. i would definitely buy more. the other reviews were right that these are super long in the legs. but they are also super comfortable. comfortable waist. slimming look.<br />i am 5\\'4&#34; and i need to have about 8 inches cut off the bottom. would be perfect for tall women or those willing to make adjustments. they don\\'t seem to shrink which is good. i like them in spite of the length, because to me it is more important to be comfortable in the stomach. i wear these under my wetsuit when scuba diving. very comfortable and they make the wet suit go on and off so much easier. i highly recommend. they are also nice to wear under a skirt on a hot day to prevent thigh chafing. love it !!! recepient happy with these pajamas. very comfortable love these n color very comfy came in mail on time like color rated high cuz it met all my expetations nice fit i can wear these to work and still feel good.  they are just classy enough for our business casual environment.  my only gripe is that i wish i could get them in more colours.  the fit is great.  they are soft and comfy.  plus it has pockets and a belt loop for my work id badge clip (always a plus in my book). the product arrived promptly and in good condition. great, except she needs one size larger i get a lot of compliments on these, i may buy a second pair! my daughter loves the style and fit! comfy lightweight material. would buy more similar to this! sexy leggings!! great product! very fast shipping!  got a little small but not bad love these pants!! i\\'m pregnant and needed pants that had a stretchy waist band because it\\'s so hard to find actual maternity scrubs...these are perfect. i usually wear the koi lindsay pants but these are my new favorite. one size up from my normal non-pregnant size fits perfectly now and will hopefully fit throughout the next 3 months as well. love love the mocha color and fit! quality fabric and elegant fit i bought them in medium like i would buy everything else in medium. they fit. maybe because of the spandex type material i could also wear a large, they kind of squish my butt a little flat. makes me wanna do squats. i love these pants, the only issue i have with them is the stretch out and get longer as you wear them. very comfy. delivery was really quick. like the quality. but have to be careful about size. i usually wear jeans between 26 - 27&#34; and ordered small. it\\'s sort of tight but still can wear so i can say the width is just ok. but the inseam is very short. my height is five feet and four. these pants don\\'t reach my ankles. super soft and comfortable. love the design. no pinching, not to tight or to loose. love them! i will be ordering more. i love them and came back to buy another pair to find that they went up substantially in price so i found them at 6pm wish i had gone with my normal size. i\\'m usually a medium, but got a large after reading the reviews. i think the medium would have fit perfect. but these are the most comfortable pants and i can\\'t wait to bring them on vacation! they are warm and definitely a conversation starter! they\\'re incredibly comfortable and fit extremely well. i love them! these pants are great for lounging around in in the evenings and weekends. with the right top, i could probably wear them for casual friday at work. the elastic waistband is very giving and doesn\\'t cut or bind. fits perfectly. this is the best palazzo pants that i\\'ve had, however the quality of fabric could have been better. nice wear on the dave koz jazz cruise pj party . just right in length, i\\'m 5\\'2 and most pants are too long. very comfortable and not to thick. plus, they do not roll or slide down when bending. thank they fit fine. nothing specials. just yoga pants. a size 2 or 3 when they sell odd numbers. i\\'m 5\\'5. i bought a medium.<br />nothing else to say. nice fabric, love the pattern.  the reason for only 4 stars is because they run so small. i like my jammie pants roomy. love these pants. very comfortable and great for around the house! any johnny depp,captain jack sparrow, or pirate fan would love them. i love them just are a little bigger then i thought they would be i have to roll them. i love these! the colors are definitely true to the picture: i got the mint ones with the flower print and absolutely love it; very pretty. these palazzo pants are very comfy, the fabric is very nice and cool, even these are long pants they are perfect for hot weather. i am 6 feet tall so it\\'s usually hard to find long enought pants, but these are even a bit too long, you can trim these as you like, but i actually didn\\'t because i love that it\\'s a bit longer, would be perfect with heels. true to size, and the fabric is strechy as well. i received this product at a discounted price in return for my honest opinion. i agree with some of the reviews, but my purchase was great!!! i love them!! i would buy again and of course a size bigger i ordered and xl i would go a size bigger and the length for me is perfect i\\'m 5\\'8 and with the perfect shoes i will look hot. these are very comfy and fit just right for me.  they were nice in the pool and the hot tub. the waist is perfect the length was a little short. having a 5\\'5&#34;, 90 lbs, and size zero teen makes it hard to find the exact fit. good thing leg warmers & boots cover the shorter length. these pants are perfect for dance/zumba class. i\\'m a zumba instructor and i love how the fabric stays cool even after dancing for one hour. they are very comfortable and fit really nicely. i\\'m 5\\'6 and they are very long for me. i\\'m also very slim and they are not baggy at all. love them!!! too big, but great product!!! exactly as pictured! will keep 16,great feel and look have three colors, accidently ordered two red pair. they are a bit snug i am 5\\'7 130lbs i have an athletic build. i like how they look with heels! they get a little shear it the top by the thighs.<br />they dont give you a muffin top which is a big plus!!! they do have a funny smell but i am sure with a washing or two it will subside. i will probably order a few more pair. exactly how they looked i will wear these often this coming spring and summer , very comfortable i will buy more of different colors , i would like price to decrease the more you buy would be nice , hope they don\\'t shrink when i wash them ,as they fit well now  and that would be disappointed i will air dry them to be sure , i say description is accurate ,price is reasonable and love the variety of colors , i will be buying more for sure. i\\'m only 5 feet 1 inch and 160 lbs. but they are very forgiving and fit a variety of figures ,tall ,short somewhat over weight, or not you will love them. i recomend them to all who enjoy easy living,yoga and/or just to relax warm and cute! i\\'m usually 4/6 size and this time the 28 size was perfect for me.  beautiful, despite the price and an acceptable material i love these lysse boot cut pants. they give great support and look dressy because the bottoms fit over a shoe or sneaker. very flattering! they are fabulous!  the look nice and are easy to wear.  a little long....but workable! these pants fit great, and though i typically wear a medium in women\\'s scrubs, in these i wear a small tall. i love the cargo styling. however, i repeatedly ordered ruby and ened up with grey. after two tries, i ordered these pants from somewhere else. i returned this item. sooo comfy!! product is very comfy, so that is a big plus but it seemed to shrink and around the legs taper after a few washes,even in cold water. i love this outfit but the top is small and the bottom is a little bit two big but it\\'s okay super soft pants and great price. the only thing i would do different is order an xl instead of a large. i have a thick waist but can usually wear a large with an elastic waist. these are a little snug in the waistband. other than that, they are super! nice timely delivery, perfect fit, thanks. really nice looking jeans but ran very large. these are very comfortable and well made. soft fabric. i am very happy upon receiving this product. i have been wanting since i saw this online and when i got it, i wasn\\'t disappointed. i bought the large size and the size fits me as i expected based on the pictures. they are extremely soft and comfortable to wear anytime of the day. i love it\\'s design with stretch fit & wide leg silhouette, it makes me sexy. the fit is flattering and laid back look but still trendy. i have inspected the material and you can see that it was made with quality. the materials are made from 96% rayon and 40% spandex. it is a very versatile pants as you can wear it as casual wear, for night party or informal dinner. this is really a 5 star for me. for stylish women out there which are looking for comfortable clothes, i highly recommend this product. i got this as a discounted item in exchange for an honest review. these shorts are a great value, good fit and quality. they\\'re cute but the design was a little blue and they\\'re kinda small. i\\'m a us size 9 and they were either tight on the thighs or too short. shipping was nice and fast. i\\'ll probably order again. love love love this. i like these pants...but i don\\'t love them. they\\'re very thin and more of a legging quality than i was looking for (since they were categorized as pants). but i can wear them out and to work and again they are pretty comfortable. good fit too. very soft and comfy! i\\'m a size 6-8, and these pants are pretty  big on me, but luckily they shrunk up enough to wear for pj day in my classroom! they are now my favorite pj\\'s at home! very comfy! very soft! i ordered these cargo pants for my daughter who was going to play paintball.  they ere perfect.  just the rigt weight and the fit was great. i rocked these pants and i cannot count the compliments i got in them.  i hope they make them in a thicker material for the winter and i will be all over them. if you\\'re looking for perfect yoga pants, these are what you want. i\\'ve bought hella pants on the internet and either they would be too stiff, too thin, or too bad quality. i got these today and i love them. i have no complaints. i got them in three days, they\\'re soft and stretchy but not see-through. they\\'re tight mostly everywhere but then flare below the knee, which is flattering. i\\'m 5\\'4 and they\\'re a little long, but i like them that way. idk why anyone is saying they\\'re not that great, cause i\\'m pretty satisfied. at first i was skeptical about the one size fits all but it fits pretty good, very stretchable. if you\\'re obese it probably wont fit but chunky fits fine, and it has drawstrings for skinny people. material is very light and breathable, made of rayon. the only downside to it is it needs to be hand washed but besides that i love it. color is vibrant and feels soft and breezy. awesome pants, highly recommended!!<br />they are such great pants! cool colors ( i got 9 colors!).<br />the material is so soft, comfortable and not as crazy rayon see through like most pants of this style are. i would absolutely recommend them and i\\'ll buy more shortly. the fabric is pretty nice. the floral pattern is really cute. i like how the shorts fit me. it is definitely a great deal at that price. great fit comfy light and easy to wear. took 2-3 weeks but it\\'s great!! perfect love these. wanna get more. i love these pants.  they fit perfectly and are great for golf.  i will be buying more of these!! my first time wearing yoga pants and i\\'m hooked.<br />i\\'m pear shaped with short legs. bought the petite fit and they are perfect. nice and roomy in the thigh area.<br />definitely buying a few more pairs. thank you ! they loved it so comfy! it\\'s hard not wanting to wear them everyday i can only say that my wife loves alfred dunner ladieswear. my problem is that i ordered the wrong thing. she actually wanted alfred dunner &#34;corduroy&#34; pants not polyester. i was not watching what i was doing so i made a mistake! still a good product! good for summertime but not for winter. my wife loved them. excellent material and comfortable very nice and extremely comfortable i want to buy these in every color/pattern available. so comfortable, fit great and they are long enough!  i have really long legs and it\\'s hard to find good pants.  so love them!! absolutely love them love them.. these pants are super comfy. the fabric is light weight without being flimsy. i didn\\'t give 5 stars because i am tall (5\\'10&#34;) and the pants are just long enough. another inch in length would make them perfect for me. these workout pants are quite comfortable and the fabric is very nice. however, i would have liked the bottom to be narrower (it is 10 inches wide). the pants look much narrower on the picture than they really are. i wanted comfortable pants to wear at home, and these pants are perfect in that sense, so i did not return them. good quality ... comfort it feelss great to wear and is very comfortable for work and play.  love it it\\'s very nice to wear. nice and soft and veryt cool being a gym rat and in college i\\'m always looking for base layers that can remain comfortable throughout my workouts, and these are hands down awesome. good compression, great length (don\\'t see ankles if properly tucked in socks), and maintains elasticity through squats, deadlifts, and cardio. can\\'t complain =) i got these pants to go with my corset that i got from amazon for comic con they fit perfectly and they go great with the corset that i brought from amazon. very nice pants, perfect fit, nice fabric recommend it fit in all other aspects, but i am rather short so they did fit a little long and sort of bunched up in places. the leggings were super cute, but the black part is a little off black and not as dark as i was hoping for. all in all, they did their job in providing me an alternative and inexpensive harley quinn look and they were super comfy. hips and legs too wide for my waist size, but beautiful material, a steal at the price. had to return for size only, but manufacturer graciously offered to send custom-made version at no extra cost. i would really love that, given that this is such a beautiful product. i picked these up at my local target store and i\\'m glad i did.  they are well made, comfortable and great for those with long legs.  i will say they run big...i normally wear a size 6 and these pants in a size 4 fit just right.  they\\'re a great value with very good quality! these have got to be my favorite pant purchase adn i plan on buying mroe in different colors.  they fit well, are comfortable, and wash well. i love it! i was worried because i tougth it run small. but not, it fit well. i wear it with a red blousse, and everybody at the office love it. im gonna buy more.  - the blanck part its not transparent these came a day early and they fit great! i can\\'t wait to wear then to run and to the gym! thanks for the great product! love these pants!!!  relaxed fit and super comfy. can stretch and bend no problem in pants that look like &#34;normal&#34; pants. runs true to size. nice mesh pockets in front; two additional velcro closure pockets in back. i wish there were some half sizes in the lindsey\\'s.  like a med and a half.  i first ordered the xl-tall according to the size chart, you could fit 2 of me in them.  i ordered the large they are still a bit big but i know that i can not fit into a med-tall.  i just wish that the legs were slimmer as i do not carry weight in my thigh\\'s.<br /><br />i ordered the talls because i want the pants to go past my ankles.  these fit the bill for length.<br /><br />i would recommend them to others and will order more as they are good looking scrub bottoms. all colors are true to what is shown online. these came very quickly and it was with some trepidation that i tried them on (you never know buying clothes online), but they fit perfectly. i\\'m 5\\'7&#34;, 116 lbs and bought size 7. i probably could\\'ve fit into their size 5, as well, but i don\\'t really like tight pants. these fit snugly, but are not binding in any way. the length is just right, too--coming just below my ankles. the fabric is soft and has a slight sheen--as in the photo. they\\'re quite comfortable--always a bonus! love these! perfect length for me. love my new sleep pants! they are true to size and very comfy, nice to lounge and sleep in. would buy again if there were other patterns. perfect shorts for wearing around the house. i absolutely love these pants.  i only own one pair, but plan to order more. i am 5\\'9\\\\\\\\\" and they are plenty long enough, fit true to size, and wash well.  i wear these pants around the house more than any of my others.  i wish they came in more colors so i can order a variety. i love these scrub pants! i have 2 pairs, about to buy a 3rd. they are so comfortable and stretchy, almost like yoga pants. i\\'m 5\\'9&#34; and have trouble with &#34;tall&#34; sizes being too short still- not these! they are plenty long and look great with danskos or tennis shoes. cannot say enough how much i love these! if you\\'re still questioning whether to buy them, go to a local scrub shop then buy them on here for a better price! pants fit perfectly.  great quality.  no complaints. love! they are really nice. lightweight material, comfortable, and relaxed! overall, great!<br />great for wearing around the house or for yoga...<br />i got them in black, red, and blue... love it! great fit, very stylish. definitely five stars. runs slightly large. great quality and stretch is amazing. bought for my niece and she tried and like it as she finds that it is comfortable it\\'s fits on her well. the price is also reasonable. it is very light and good shape of skinny. i have a size large as size 8 or10 in usa.it is nice stretchable and very comfortable. i washed several times still feel tight and same look ...must have item... i ordered these monday and they were at my door on thursday.  the fabric is lightweight but not translucent, great for summertime.  i\\'m 175 lbs, 5\\'9\\\\\\\\\" and the large fits perfectly.  they\\'re nice and stretchy at the top, very comfortable.  i usually prefer something that isn\\'t so loose at the ankles, but these are and i still like them.  they are loose, but not bell bottomy.  they would be great for yoga.  because of the fabric being thin, my underwear line is pretty visible. i probably won\\'t be wearing these out in public unless it\\'s with no line panties or a long t-shirt... they\\'d be great to slip on over a swimsuit.  the fabric is akin to t-shirt material, just a bit thinner and stretchier.  very soft.  if they break down over several washings, i will update this review.  if you don\\'t hear back, you can expect they\\'re durable as well.  if they hold up, at $10, i\\'ll be ordering a few more pairs.  uber lazy-pants! i really love these pant! they fit great! the color was the same as in the picture, or maybe a little brighter, candy apple red. the material the pants are made of is really soft and comfortable and they are loose fitting like in the picture. i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; between 105 and 110 lbs and bought a small. it fits perfect on my waist (i wear a size 1 or 3 depending on the pants). the only reason i didn\\'t give these pants 5 stars was because they\\'re long. they are made for someone who is like 5\\'7&#34; at the least, and, as i said, i ordered a small. i\\'m probably going to have to get them hemmed or something because i love these pants too much to send them back. so a warning to all the short girls like moi, these pants will pool at your feet, but if your fine with that i would definitely encourage you to buy them. they fit great and they\\'re cute. love it.  6 month update: still love these! they really hold up well to multiple washings. other brands i ordered at a similar price start to tear the upper in-seam. i wore theses constantly in winter and spring, and they\\'re still going strong. i\\'m 5\\'4&#34;, so they\\'re a bit long, but it doesn\\'t bother me and the heels haven\\'t frayed at all. my girlfriend loves them! makes her butt look good too! hahahaha!!! thank people! as expected! ++ they hang so beautifully.  i am a big girl size 18.  these pants make me look like a 14.  they are extremely long though, but i ordered a very large size, so probably that is why.  but in all other ways the fit is so nice.  they are so cool and breezy.  love them! far thinner material than i expected.  polyester has come a long way.  extremely comfortable.  you can go out for a nice evening feeling like you are wearing pajamas.  i can pair it with my boyfriend blazer and heels for an elegant sophisticated look or heeled sandals and top for a more relaxed look during the day.  i ordered the small and these are very long.  i am 5\\' 6&#34; and they reach the floor, hence the necessity for heels. i got this for my sakura con cosplay costume. i\\'m going as toad from mario kart, which is arabian, or something. although it looks like he has no legs in the game, i do have legs, so this is much better for a costume than what my friend said i should wear.. a diaper. nice koi lindsey scrubs but petite size is still to long.  i am 5 feet tall and will need to have them shortened. this is an extra cost. i like the color and style so i will keep the scrubs. the only improvement i could suggest is to make them a couple of inches longer-  they shrunk in length when laundered.  pockets could also be deeper. i absolutely love these pants! they fit really well. they are a little long but thats how i like them. i love them but they are see threw :( 👍 thanks** love these pants!  cute and comfortable!  i have only washed them once, but they seemed to come out nicely!  i am looking forward to wearing these on our vacation!  i don\\'t know if they stretch out yet, but if nothing else i can wear them around the house, since they will be so cool for the summer!  love the waste band, no zippers or elastic:)  material weight is good, not too thin! i just got this item and am in love with it. i bought a medium (i always fit in medium pants and usually small tops) and both pieces were extremely small. pants were not high waisted but material is very stretchy. wonderful customer service from the company. good!! good only thing i do not like is i have to have them hemmed because i couldn\\'t find any in short. fit nice. cool but the pants legs are extremely long - i am very tall and they were way too long for me. plenty of room for spatulas?  i keep all of my cooking gear in there!  i dont know what random guy was complaining about! fits as expected. love these pants. will order on other colors i bought a pair for both my husband and i. they are super simple, really comfy, and nice enough looking that one could leave the house with them. my only complaint is the pocket.  its in a strange place and only on one side. the fabric is super thin (nice for summer) and doesn\\'t shrink in the dryer. pretty color very comfortable and fits very well only problem i have is the material grabs lint from anywhere and there is white fuzzies all over black scrubs love them. i had some difficulties getting my package but once i received the product i was very happy. these skinny pants are true to size and comfortable.  i plan to buy more in the future. love these pants! so soft and comfortable, the right length.. every thing you could want. these are my favorite scrub pants. i love koi scrubs and they are currently the only scrubs i own and purchase. bought a size bigger and still too small love the pants just wish they fit after reading the other reviews, i understood that the pants would be too long.  they are, but i hemmed them pretty easily.  they are wicked comfortable and fun! great for the summer days if you don\\'t want to wear shorts or a skirt. just love these pants.i bought 3 pairs and wish i could find these in many colors. i would them again in a split second these pants are well constructed.  i order the petite and it does not need hemming.  they wear well, wash well.  i have worn the same pants during the day to a yoga class, walking the dog and dress it up in the evening to go the kennedy center.  i have 7 pair and wear them every day.  they are a great value! i was on the fence about ordering a 4 or a 6 as idid not want to hassle with returning.  from site info should have ordered a 4... most of the reviews saying how small they ran edged me to a 6.<br />they still fit but are a bit loose and i need a belt but i love them and ordered another pair in a different color in size 4 love how they stretch, glad i got them i ordered a medium these are the best pants i have purchased in a while. light, and a great fit. i usually have so many problems finding pants that fit...i have large hips and thighs and a little waist. i am 5\\'7&#34; and a size 14 pants and ordered the tall xl.  they are perfect! nice i bought the lindsey pant and normally buy the skinny lindsey.  i prefer the skinny pant it just looks less frumpy.<br />these are a bit baggy but they don\\'t have the skinny pant in as many colors. the leggings i bought were a great selection. i should\\'ve gotten a bigger size but i was still satisfied. i love the allegra k brand. nice! the pants don\\'t seem as long as they look in the picture. they start to flare at the knee for me, but that could be because they are a bit larger than i expected. i ordered a large and generally fit size 10-12 but it is fairly loose in the waist, tight in the thigh, and flare at the knee, as well as being a fairly thin material (when stretched you can see a bit of skin tone but not nearly as bad as some leggings people are passing off as pants these days). they are very comfortable though and i do not regret the purchase at all. these pants are sleek and fit very well. they are soft and comfortable. the pants are hem is unfinished but all you have to do is hem them or just take them to the cleaners and let them finish. all together great pants i loved the uniform! but despite xs say it \\'ll stay like giant xg ... i could not use it .. would like to get a little truth in uniform... were returned to small.nice material good workmanship. very nice and the color is beautiful!! looks great,  quite the assortment of colors and patterns.  none of which were pictured online but they are all awesome!  individually wrapped and came in a timely manner and in great condition.  feel great and fit awesome!  i found that one side is usually much brighter and loud,  the other side less busy and a bit more everyday.  i\\'m a guy and i love these pants. wear them as pajamas almost every day! love these pants! they are not too wide and not too tight. absolutely perfect! they are superrrr long. i\\'m 5\\'5 and i cut them 3 inches and now they are perfect to wear with flip flops. shortening them is very easy too because the type of material can have an unfinished end. no sewing necessary. great pants. just a tiny bit small. but doable. soft, comfortable,and fun. why get out of bed? very happy with the pj\\'s! ordered a size up based on reviews and pants fit perfectly.  love these! sorry, but i don\\'t feel i &#34;owe&#34; more, gave positive feedback. love the pattern and quality of material.  fits as expected very pleased love the pant great fit feels good on the looks good.. my girls love these leggings. they are silky feeling and stretchy for comfort. my girls are 12 & 14 and can\\'t wear them enough. my youngest daughter loves the alice in wonderland and would wear them all the time if she could. good quality leggings that fit perfectly love these so much i had to buy more. everything was as expected from fabric to color, except the sizing. i have other brands of this same style and fabric that fit great. this pair however are overly snug so they don\\'t flow nicely like my others. but because of the cost of returning i am keeping and will just wear them with long over sized tops.  (tan color)  updated:7/22/15 the second pair i had ordered in white arrived. same issue, very tight but will work with a tunic. if you have no lumps or bumps and are in perfect physical shape you will love them! but if like me there are areas of the hips and thighs you would rather not have highlighted these would be good. i never thought i would say anything was too stretchy, but these are! the pockets expand easily.  good front fit with the elastic.  rear fit still gaps without a belt. fit better then expected...im 5\\'5&#34; & the lengh was perfect... this is sized for asia. i am a petite 5\\'3&#34; 120lbs and ordered a medium with tag size large. because while i am a small (sometimes even xs) in america, i am a large in asia. that\\'s just how it goes! that said, it fits perfectly and i love it. highly recommended. fits great. very comfortable! i will keep these pants as a favorite and buy more if them, if they come in different colors. they are nice, and this is my second pair! i lovey pant, very my much! they for perfect, i love the color!  they get them, yesterday in the mail. today, is wednesday 22, 2014. i will order my some different colors on two more week. thank u for the wonderful services from amazon. i been getting all my order before time. thanks alot for  every body hard work from amazon! i give a rate every thing is a 100 percent. melissa a. carter☺️😊😉 please bring these pants back!   i\\'ve also been to several targets and they are sold out!   i cant find black velour pants anywhere else    the demand is huge! nice and comfortable they are a little wide in the calf area and not as tapered as i think they should be. they have awesome color and have been washed once so far with no fading. they are comfortable and i am happy with them. perfect these jeans are perfect. they fit my curvy body (32 waist and 42 hips) without being granny pants, aka, no waist up to the ribs like most pants that fit my proportions.  thank you, worn, for this jean!   they stretched a bit after wearing (especially in the waist where i bend a lot) so i will still need to take them in an inch or so at the waist, but hey, that small of an amount tucked behind the beltloop will be fine and won\\'t be noticed a bit.  they fit great enough everywhere else to go through that small trouble.  they are long in the inseam too so great for tall gals (not me) but i like that i can pick the length.  they\\'re easy to hem and let me say it again, the fit is worth it. these pants are da bomb. they fall nicely, they feel great, they are nice enough to wear out and comfy enough for lounging around the house. so comfortable! nice gift. love these pants. took me a while to figure out how to get them on, but when i did they are great! so comfortable. i will be attaching a bigger pocket to it for convenience i am 5\\' 7&#34;  and athletic. the knees kind of lay a little above mine but nothing too noticeable. even with  the mis alignment in the knee area  they still come all the way down pass my ankles. i got so many compliments and inquires on them. for the price they are s great buy. i love these shorts. they are exactly like the ones from american apparel but a bit shorter. they even say american apparel on the label. i expected these to be faulty, but they were 100% legit. also it came within 16 days since i ordered it. the only bad thing is that it didn\\'t have the hole to put the button in cut out, but that was easy to do by myself. i am really happy with this purchase! love the pants and they are true to size , but it took over a month to receive the item ! finally my order have just arrived today yes!! and i like them, the fabric were very soft as expected, but hopefully next time will be at least no more than 2 weeks waiting to receive my order. thank you i was looking for some dress pants that fit good and still be able to wear on evening outings with my husband or friends. i like the way they fit, their so comfortable with the elastic waist. i like that their a little high top so i feel comfortable, i don\\'t worry about anything rolling down. the material is nice and thick, they slip on like leggings but are made from a better material than regular leggings. these dress pants are very flattering and mold your body. over all i love that i can use them to go out or to wear when i go into the office for work. their great! love! i lve it. thank you, granrad77 its made of a very comfortable material and has a fun pattern.  a unique pair of leggings. comfortable and pretty. my daughter is a doggy lover. the p.j.\\'s are cozy and true to size. a great gift for any doggy lover. fits alright, but i feel it will fit better when i lose some weight. i am between sizes and have a difficult time finding clothes that fit comfortably. it\\'s comfortable and i feel beautiful but, it\\'s beautiful! very comfortable but the side pockets do stick out a bit. great color. great fit these pants are great. they are not see through, seems to be well made, are not super long like most linen pants, and are true to size. i wear a 6 in misses and a 9 in juniors. i ordered the medium and have no complaints.\\\\\\\\\"  for the price offered here you can\\'t go wrong. the material is soft very comfortable 5\\'5&#34; 140 lbs medium fit great color very pleased! these pants are super stretchy and very light.  i ordered the baby blue, and they are gorgeous! they are very flattering, i am at the larger end of the size range i bought and expected a little squeeze and bulge, not at all! pretty dress.  too small because i do not know how to order properly for foreign sizes compared to u.s. sizes.  no fault of seller. material & fit was just like picture these are perfect! not sheer/see-through at all and they have a nice silky shimmer to them. really good quality for the price. they were delivered way faster than i expected as well. one caveat, i have to second what a lot of other people have said, i am 5\\'5&#34; and 117 lbs. so (please i mean no offense) bigger hipped or taller girls may not find these as good a fit as i did. this was a comfortable and sexy outfit for the event i attended. i got a lot of complements and enjoyed the feel and sexy of the outfit. arrived early and nicely shipped. super thin material, but they are pretty cool... i am not shaped to wear one pieces. my top is heavy but my bottom is small. this piece fits so nice that i wore it unexpectedly as a birthday outfit. love it!!! i love grey\\'s anatomy scrubs. you don\\'t feel you are wearing baggy scrubs. these pants are a bit big. i am usually small or even medium at the hip but with those i fit in x small. nice fabric and nice cute. love them love these. they came super early, within 2 weeks. they are super cute, not as thick as i\\'d like it to be but that\\'s ok. they fit perfectly in terms of length but fit a little weird around the waist but not too big of a deal to not make you return it. great product for the price. good i received the geometric capri pants and they are the most comfortable pants i\\'ve worn.  i could wear these every day.  i love that they have a stretchy elastic band with drawstring.  i got so many compliments on these pants.  they fit perfectly, as i received a large.  perfect pants for summer!<br /><br />***i received this product, in exchange, for my honest opinion.  all opinions are 100% my own. very long, but good pants. comfortable...affordable and was perfect for the pool party i attended. im sure these will come in very handy for upcoming trips/vacations. hopefully i can order them in more colors, to have more options. they fit perfect to my body, and make me feel sexy and chic i love these. they are so compfy. i\\'m 55 years old & in for comfort. i had surgery & gained some weight. i weigh 160 now & they still don\\'t fit to tight. love that.  they came way before the delivery date also. i would order from this seller again. i hope this was helpful. these are my favorite scrub pants on the market.  love the skinny leg, the waistline fits well. great to work out in love them!  the color is true to the picture.  the material is nice and soft and very comfortable wear.  really enjoying wearing them. these pants are cute & comfy. they do run small so if you have junk in the truck go one size up. i get compliments all the time, wanting to know where i got them and who they are made by. i like them so much i bought two more these are exactly what i was looking for! i\\'m glad i read the reviews about sizing - i ordered an xxl (im usually a l or xl) and they *just*fit! i will have to hand wash cold and hang dry. it\\'s hard to find shorts for exercise at this length, which is why it is worth it to me to hand wash. they are super soft and surprisingly made well..i will definetly order more colors. just tried on and decided not to keep. was looking for a full cotton pair of pants, without any polymers added,due to severe allergies. needed to be able to wear in public. these pants are very see-through so they don\\'t work for my intended purpose. excellent pants for lounging around the house though if you need 100% organic cotton. seem to fit as long as you follow the sizing chart. night gown is short but makes a good t shirt i am 5\\'10 and was worried about this being to short fits perfectly!<br />however it\\'s a weird fit with a tank underneath i\\'d suggest a bado for the super low cut these are the most comfortable pant i have ever had.  perfect fit, soft, they don\\'t bag after wearing them for hours. i wish they had more in stock so that i could buy every color.  i would recommend these for everyone. i love these pants and they fit perfectly too! these are great to wear when traveling long distances by plane. they are comfortable, dressier than sweats, and most important of all, don\\'t wrinkle. the xs small fits a 24 inch waist perfectly. fit well . bottoms a little tight they run very long i had to shorten them, other than that they are a nice thinner material for summer. these are really nice bottoms. the pattern is nice and colors are too. the waist fits a bit higher than i like but i just folded the waist band over and they are perfect. the fabric is a nice cotton, not too flimsy and not too heavy. they are perfect for the spring and i know i will get a lot of wear out of them. they wash well too. very nice these are perfect for winter, i mean, i\\'m from a place where snow is not there (torrid zone), i\\'m experiencing my first winter ever, so i have to wear 2 of this, but still, it works for me like that. i got one of each color so i match them with oversized sweaters, looks so cute. my daughter wore these on our last cross-country ski excursion here in montana.  we went to glacier national park in early january.  i think the high was 8 that day.  she was warm, and she loves the pants.  she normally wears a medium, so i ordered the extra large and they were perfect.  they look very nice on her too.  she will get good use of them at college in laramie wyoming. love the pattern!! and the length is perfect for a 5\\'10 gal. i have several pairs of the lysse leggings.  the denim with slit fit exactly as expected except the slit is a little lower on my leg because i am short.  but they feel good and look great. i loved this pants that i already got three. however for some reason this pants are a little tight on the waist. not as comfortable as i was expecting. they came today and i orderd a large and im bigger in the lower area but they fit perfect!! these pants were returned because they didn\\'t fit.  i usually wear a standard size, but these were too small and way too long. for my size its difficult to find pants like this that look good on me, is wonderfully comfortable, & can be used casually & at work. i will be ordering more of this. after washing it still fit the same, no drastic shrinkage which is what i was worried about. okay, that was a horrible joke in the title, but these flannel pajama pants are perfect! they\\'re super cute with the bear design, and they\\'re also very warm. i bought a size up because i like my pjs to fit loosely, and these fit great. plus, the drawstring waistband makes them fit in the waist even while being baggy in the legs (which is what i wanted). they\\'re somewhat longer than i expected. i\\'m 5\\'4, and they extend at least 4 inches below the heel of my foot. again, this is what i like in my pj pants, but i thought it was worth mentioning. i love these leggings! i\\'m short and chubby, i ordered size medium and they fit perfectly! soft material and perfect fit. love this brand of pants. i ordered a size large but one of the tops received was a small. i wont bother to return it though. i also got 4 other tops and 1 pair of stretch pants. overall happy with the package and like the surprise element of the purchase. the clothing was decent quality. i will likely try this again in the future. nice slim fit. too tight fitting for work but i like them very much i love these pants for work.  no they don\\'t last forever, but you can\\'t expect them to at that price.  i am sad because i have not been able to order them for a while and winter is coming around the corner!!!!!  they need to get these back in stock in all sizes because the xxl is too big for me now.  i went down to the xxl, but now i need to go down to the xl.  please, please, please get these back in stock they are pretty awesome.  however, i\\'m not especially small (size 4), and they are pretty big on me. fit was good and the length of the pants were right on.  soft material.  washes up fine. these were a gift--said she loved them! i bought these for my best friend for christmas, who\\'s a crazy cat lady...haha she loved them! her mother thinks they\\'re ugly, but i think they\\'re cute and so does she. beautiful pants.  well made.. these fit great!  i read that they were too long, but i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; and the small size fits perfectly!  i wouldn\\'t say they are the highest quality, but they\\'re much better than i expected for only paying $15! pants are great bought these for practicing poi and juggling, and to take with me to festivals over the summer. they are super comfortable and having pockets in them is great. my only worry is that the seams appear to be somewhat thinly sewn, though i have had no issues from them as of yet. love them! nice and comfy daughter loves them. so perfect for work. very flattering and comfortable. love them! obviously, i got these for a costume party. they are very cheaply  made and are one size, so don\\'t fit exactly right. but, for the price for costume pants, they are definitely well worth it. just don\\'t be disappointed that the quality is not great. i have worn these pants for years and i love them.  they are so easy to travel with and the bonus is stain-resistant.  my only wish was that they would offer the plus size in petites, as i do have to shorten these pants when i get them.<br /><br />i will keep ordering them as the fit is good and they never need to be ironed. what a wonderful pair of pants. they are true to the size and look astonishing. very soft material. they go perfectly with my heels. it is a perfect pair for the office look or official business as they look very classy and upscale. the seam running down each leg makes the legs look skinnier and not like some other pants, bigger thighs wont stretch the upper part of the seam out. i will get these ones in all colors. worth the cost. i am so thankful to the hot from hollywood company for providing me the career fitted double button pants at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. i love the material it was super comfy! arrived very fast and as shiny as shown in the picture. i hope they stretch an inch or two as i wear them but overall excellent purchase. i read the reviews carefully before buying and was very careful about  buying the right size. why these? i liked the price!! i actually use them for yoga and they are a good fit! very sexy love them love them!!! there a great fashion statement, i love a bold print & these pants will def give them!! great for a date, girls night out etc love it! kid loves it they are nice great quality and soft velour fabric. enough room and very comfortable. overall this item is as described and am very satisfied with this tracksuit set! would purchase again! looks nice. nice quality but little large for me. xsmall is always fit for me but this one is quite big for me. planning to order another different color. love them!!!! they feel great on! these pants are amazingly comfortable. the colors are even more beautiful than in the picture. the pocket can fit just about anything but is more for show since the material is so thin, but i\\'m not complaining. i am soooo impressed with these. i hardly wear anything else now (i\\'m not joking. my mother has been complaining that i only ever dress like a &#34;hippie&#34; now, but i can\\'t help it.)  they\\'re good for sleep pants if you\\'re not into wearing hippie clothes out in public, but they look great with neutral colored tee shirts and plain white or black tank tops. they inspire me to do more yoga so i can look like those meditating buddhist people on google images. these pants are good for mind, body, and soul. do yourself a favor and get these for yourself. just got these pants. they are extremely comfortable, and a bit long on me. i\\'m 5&#34;5\\' and weigh 145lbs (23 weeks pregnant), and feel comfy in the size medium, with room for growth. they are very thin, which is nice for the lightweight factor, but i\\'ll be sure to wear a long tank-top that covers my butt! i exchanged my medium for a small and they fit great. i am 5\\'7 and 126 lbs. the length on the small is great. the are wide leg, light weight, and super comfy. i will prob order more of them in different colors. love them! the pants themselves are super nice and comfortable, they do run large. really nice love these! they fit perfectly and even though they came from china, they came quicker than i expected. although the waist seem a little tight but the pant is so classy. this a good one for high classy babes ;) nice and comfy love these pants. i have had several thru out the years and will keep buying them as long as they are available. they look nice and feel comfy. the sun protection gives a different level of &#34;comfort&#34; knowing i am not getting too much exposure on my legs. i use other clothing items from collibar for the same reason and have be very satified with every one. i love the quality and the fit of these pants. the outfit fits perfect and i am looking forward to purchasing more perhaps in different colors. i like these and can wear them in warmer weather unlike my other leggings. so i\\'m 5\\'5&#34;, 160 pounds and typically a size 6. i ordered a size small because i\\'m a tight wad and wanted the cheaper option. well when i took them out of the package, they looked quite small (no duh, i know), but when i tried them on, they stretched perfectly and fit amazingly.<br />i\\'ve worn them only 3 times and the thighs are starting to bead up a bit which sucks, but it\\'s not shocking since i have thunder thighs and they are cheap sweats.<br />but seriously, these are amazing sweats for the price. i love these pants.  they are so comfortable and at the same time beautiful. super comfy pants! great fit! the only unfortunate thing was that the seam in the crotch came apart after just a few wears. i was able to stitch it back together but it was disappointing. otherwise they\\'re very comfortable! the pants are worthy, it looks elegant and sexy. te only drawback is that it is somewhat transparent so you need to ear a suitable underwear. but i really like it. overall for the price i got what i paid for. the material is a bit thin and they did run a bit small. not a bad pair for around the house workouts. love them. comfortable, well made, soft. my favorite yoga pants. these leggings look exactly like the photo, which made me very happy. they fit pretty great and they stay up well unlike other leggings with a tendency to slide down and then having to constantly readjust them. they\\'re not see through, which is also great. the shipping does take a while (ordered on the 11th got them on the 24th) but, that\\'s to be expected and the seller clearly states that. i\\'m happy with my purchase. cute design, fits well, very comfortable. bought it to wear around the house. material is a little rougher than i would like and fits a little tighter than i\\'d hoped it would but other than that it\\'s a nice pair a pj\\'s or lounge pants. great purchase i made, i hope to buy again soon.<br /><br />thanks you voglee family!! really like these pants. they are fitted thru the thigh with a flare that starts below the knee. great for yoga every time i wear these purple pants strangers stop to tell me how much they like my outfit. it is truly the pants that make the difference. i wear them with two different shirts that i had in my closet and never once got a complement on. these pants do turn a decent shirt into an outfit. love these pants so much. they are a little long for me but i am only 5\\'3 so i expect that. these pants fit great, with plenty of room, and looked like i should have been in a john t. move dancing thanks so much love the fabric! i loved this  color so much the only problem with it was that the pants ripped of maybe they were not sown good from in between my legs so sad:( but other than that the material it very good and it felt good these pants are wonderful!!!!!!!. i just love them.  i got two pairs and they are great.  i will bebgetting more. i ordered 3 pairs of pants:navy, black and rust. the quality of these pants is superb! they seem much more durable than any other linen items i\\'ve had in the past. only drawback is the length. i\\'m 5\\'4\\\\\\\\\" and size s. i need to hem them.<br /><br />otherwise, i am more than happy. good value and classy addition to the wardrobe. picture made it look like pants,their actually cropped. love my pants great color nice fit fits smaller than anticipated, but very pretty and sexy i love these pants! i have two pairs of these now and plan to get more. they are thin, but that\\'s a &#34;pro&#34; for me because they\\'re light and breathable. super comfy and despite the thin material my first pair has stood up against frequent wear for nearly a year now and they still look great. i received this product in exchange for a review of my honest and unbiased,the shipping was fast as it normally is with amazon prime  and it was packaged securely, easy to open very high quality material feels nice against the skin and very comfortable,lots of pockets  and loops for belts color doesn\\'t fade in wash and doesn\\'t shrink in dryer would buy in more colors nice design from a trusted company,.all buttons and zippers work nicely with no snags it is soft comfortable and doesnt have any defects.the size is almost a good fit with some looseness but not too much. this product is great because its made of durable materials, its very usable, fashionable and hip, and is a great product that does as described. these pants have a few designs with a variety of pocket choices comes in many sizes and colors can be worn to dress up or dress down any outfit. i referred this product to all my friend i have got many compliments on this pant this review is my own and my opinions may differ from another personst i\\'ve only had the opportunity to wear them once, so i\\'m not sure of the long term quality, but so far i love them!  i would definitely suggest them for this price!! really awesome. great fit, high rise, metallic. excelente producto.. 100 % recomendable. my wife purchased she loved them very comfy bough 2 nice colors good fit. these pants are my best buy of the season! they are comfortable, appropriate everywhere, and the fit is fabulous. but, please adjust your sizes...if a 5 foot, 8 inch tall, 125 lb, woman like me is a size 4, what does a petite or very slim woman do? the moment i put them on and went outside, instantly i got compliments on the pants. it is very cute and literally goes well with most things! the pant itself has very cute usable pockets, although the material is a bit thin. good for any season except winter. it\\'s a good one size fit most pants. i\\'m 5\\'2, 110 lbs, usually i wear a size 2 for pants or small, and this one fits well. the little golden metal at the belt line adds a little sophistication to the pants so trying to be stylish is effortless! love these leggings omgggg. love these pants, perfect fit these seem to have a slim, tall juniors fit. i\\'m normally a 2 in ladies/misses, got these in m and they fit well, meaning not as tight as the picture. the legs are also wider than pictured, giving them a nice vintage look, sort of 1930s. there are drawstring ties at the hem so they don\\'t drag. they do run long -  i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; and these require heels or hemming. aside from the crazy sizing, these are great pants. fit as expected im 4 11&#34; 125lb and m fit me good! they look very cute! the only thing im concerned about is that they do not look sewn well so im scared they might rip if i bent down or after washing them. i love these pants. super flowy and comfortable and satiny enough you can wear them in public without looking like pajamas (but just as comfy!) very comfy!! nice pants, just bought another style and print. these pants run a little small but are good quality for under $12. i was happy that they offered prime do i got them with free shipping. some say they are sheer but mine are not, just not as thick as other pants.<br /><br />overall, i would buy more in the future if these last more than a few washes :-) perfect fit and fast shipping since all the negative reviews are related to the size, i wanted to be very specific about my experience with the fit.  i am actually happy with the pants.  i am 5\\'1&#34; and 106 lbs (athletic build, not very curvy) and purchased a medium.  they fit exactly the way i wanted them to with just enough room to wear thin thermals underneath and still be comfortable. these pants are a good addition to your fall/winter wardrobe!  the quality and style are good however, different than the picture shows online.  also sizing is pretty \\\\\\\\\"off\\\\\\\\\". i am a true us4 in most brands and after reading the reviews ordered a 6.  got them faster than expected (yay) but they were very tight all over!  i am awaiting a size 8 now and returning the 6.  also i am only 5\\'4 and the length was perfect on me. i had tried these pants on at marshall\\'s but wasn\\'t sure whether or not to get them. i didn\\'t and instantly regretted it. luckily i found then here for a close price. i love them! flowy, but not baggy, i think these will be perfect for spring, fall, or a summer evening! perfect style and fit! i absolutely love how these jeans fits me so well, i honestly never knew it will be this good. a friend of mine recommend this to me and i\\'m glad i heed her advice. the jeans looks well tailored and has the right size. i didn\\'t have any issues with it so its 5 stars for me. these uniforms have a perfect fit.  the person i bought it for loves it great pair of hippie lounge pants... soft and comfortable.  great product. it does look like the picture & fits great the only thing is & it might be because i\\'m tall & have long arms but the sleeves come up a little bit but other than that it\\'s good was too small but vendor helped me out. the shorts run a bit on the large size. bought a large but probably could have gotten away with a med. great pants! nice, perfectly worn style. pretty true to size. i am usually a 29, but on a good day i am a 28 and they are nice and snug. i really love the color grade but the problem is the size ! i usually ware s size and i bought xs .. its still a little bit large .. on the whole i like this brand .. recommended ❤️👌 cute but runs small. i have 2 pair of our menswear style pants &amp; i really like them!  i have shown these pants to my sister &amp; she bought several pair too.  i love the fit except the waist is a little tight.  the rest of the pant is stretchy (just a little). i wish the waist was too. or just a litttle bigger.  and i wish i could get them in kakhi.  i hope you continue to make these pants forever!  i really like them! comfy & stretchy. fit great. don\\'t order up. great product this is a silk blend, and made of sari material.  it has no chemical smell from the processing.<br /><br />the top elastic roll is of regugular elastic, and there are several rows of thin smocked elastic, because of this i expect these to last a long time.<br /><br />with other garments in this material, i wash in a lingerie bag, or by hand, and line dry.  if washing in the machine, make sure there are no garments with hooks that could damage this delicate material.<br /><br />of the 5 i received, three of them had symmetric prints and borders.  two of them showed the 1/2 and  1/2 variation one sees in sari materials (asymmetric).  i consider that to be a style and like it, others might not.<br /><br />paired with a colorful tunic, you can wear casually.<br /><br />this is flattering to apple shaped people. loved it, hugs curves, waist high enough for crop tops. i\\'m 5\\'5 170 lbs except for them being tight on my butt (which i expected) they\\'re awesome! i love the designs the material is comfortable like what leggings would be made out of and the elastic waist band stretches very well and doesn\\'t construct you or anything ! i love them ! good quality fabric and nice fit. i just had a baby 10 months ago, so needless to say my body is a little more volumptuous than it was before!  i\\'ve never worn gaunchos, but thought that they\\'d be a comfy summer work option.  i can\\'t believe how great these fit!!  i\\'m 5\\'2 as well, and they fit perfect!! very slimming and fabric is effortless to care for... very nice, bought these for my wife. i couldn\\'t take one more day of jogging pants while she is off of work in the summer. they fit great and look hot. i like these pants...they\\'re very nicely made but they were much too long.  i hemmed them - ugh! - and they\\'re still too long.  i\\'ll hem them again.  the pants are too nice to just leave them hanging unused but wish i\\'d known.  for the price, tho, it\\'s hard to complain toooo much. these are great leggings, quality stretchy material. these pants are terrific. modern style yet sophisticated enough to wear to the office. and they are washable. the cuff at the bottom allows us tall people to add length if needed. please add more colors especially khaki for the spring! nice pants. i ordered the navy, and ordered a size up as all the other comments suggested. i\\'m glad i did. (5\\'7\\\\\\\\\", 130lb, normally wear a 4, chose size m.)<br /><br />the only thing i didn\\'t expect is that the leg is very wide, much wider than it looks in the picture! if you\\'re looking for pants that will hug your figure these aren\\'t them. these pants were comfy but too a tad too small, also thin fabric but not thin enough to matter to me. they don\\'t exchange for this item so i returned it and kept another knit palazzo pant i had ordered from elsewhere. fits great and is actuality long enough for my 5\\'10&#34; frame. color is bright. fits perfect even though they did not fit me, i\\'m giving these 5 stars because they are beautifully made.  i\\'m am leaving this review specifically to help out potential buyers.  if you want these to be &#34;big, loose and flowy&#34; like on the model, i wouldn\\'t suggest you order these if you are over a size us 8.  the reason being that even though the waist stretches to 37 inches, the cut seems a little bit narrower at the top, not good for big hips (mine).  when these didn\\'t fit me i had my size 12 daughter try them, and they were snug on her as well.  so i wouldn\\'t suggest over a size us 8 on this one.  hopefully that will help avoid &#34;ordering mistakes&#34;. :-d  but yeah.  i love them.  i just wish i could wear them!  i did talk with the company and gave them measurements for &#34;average us figures&#34;, and the said they would be manufacturing larger versions.  their customer service is impeccable. luv these pants .fit real well and color beautiful. perfect for celebration i am attending!!!!! i am 5\\'7&#34; and have to wear heels to make the length as the picture.  however, this fabric can be trimmed with no difficulty as there is no formal hem.  so you can make them whatever length you want with no degradation of appearance.  they also don\\'t wrinkle so a great travel pant.  very comfortable, but the fabric doesn\\'t breathe, so a cool weather pant that hugs your body and shows well. very soft and comfortable! these pants are great.  i am 5\\'9&quot; and about 160 pounds.  the small fits great!  the material is so soft and does not ever wrinkle. i get compliments on these pants almost every time i wear them!!  nursing is a demanding job.  these pants allow me to do my job in total comfort!  definitely going to buy more. i love it!!! i\\'m super duper small and it\\'s sooo hard for me to find clothes that fit right. i\\'m a size 0 i ordered a small and it fit perfect and it\\'s comfortable. i recommend it for ladies that are small and short. good these run big.  normally i wear a 2x, but having dealt with woman within orders in the past, for the most part their clothes do run large, so i ordered a 1x which still had plenty of room.  nice to bum around house in but also nice enough to go shopping in..  i am having knee replacement surgery this month and wanted decent wide legged pants that would go on easy and off easy.  the quality is decent and wash up nicely.  i bought a couple more in different colors.  good quality for price and nice & cozy. order at least a size down from regular size. wife ordered these - usually wears a medium, these fit a tad on the small side. will be sending back & getting a large. very nice material, long enough for someone 5\\'11\\\\\\\\\", worth the hassle! i love these pants they look good and feel good i bought the large and i have 44 inch hips and they fit perfectly great fit. a little long but got them hemmed comfy and cute. got the shorts and came back for more. good product for the price. i wanted some loose cotton hang-around-the-house capris and these are perfect. great product. delivered on time and as advertised. koi is my favorite scrubs vendor, for obvious reasons. just look at how cute their scrubs line is. then try on a pair of their super soft and stylish scrub pants or cutie pie tops and you\\'ll be sold too. i love this particular cute of koi scrub pant. they are as comfortable as yoga pants or even pajama bottoms. the waist folds over, if wanted. my favorite koi pant. excelent they fit nice and are lightweight which is what i wanted for the summer. but they run large. i normally wear a medium and ordered a small and they keep sliding down around my waist. they are also kind of long and i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; these pants are super flowy and comfy at the bottom, while being more fitted at the thigh and waist, but still plenty stretchy. i wear like a size 10 in jeans, but got a medium with these and they are fine. when i say flowy, they\\'re very flowy. they almost look more like a skirt until you start walking. also, the only reason i took away a star is because the material is super thin, so in the upper thigh area where they\\'re more form fitting, they will show flaws in the body with any color other than the darker pants. i purchased the black and the coral, and while the black look totally fine, the coral shows my cellulite on the upper part of my legs. so maybe order a size up in lighter colors, or wear leggings underneath to smooth things out if you have that problem, as well. nice quality.. quick shipment.  run small but i ordered larger than needed and all is well.  well worth the cost. nice i will need and lil bit  big size too excellent qualtiy.<br /><br />very satisfied with the item. i love these pants.  from other reviews i knew they would fit quite snuggly but i love the way they fit and the blue was perfect.  even the shipping was perfect cause i needed them for the weekend and got them the day before i needed them. very cute!!! love the jeand-ordered a size larger and still to small. when ordering  go 2 sizes up most comfortable piece of clothing i now own! love love love these! so light and comfortable, i want more now!<br />the fit exactly as i expected them to and the burgundy color is beautiful. good effective i have black, light blue, 2 white and a kahki/white print that i love!! the price is amazing for the great quality. even though i am an 8, i still have the thicker waist that goes along with middle age. these have a very flattering fit (especially in back), but most importantly, they are soooo comfortable. i discovered them this year and am glad i bought as many as i did. i went back for more and can\\'t find them in my size. i would love to see them in darker colors and longer length for fall and winter. cherokee is a great line! this one fit me right, the only thing is the material is kinda too thin... but over all its very comfortable to wear... very comfortable and breezy and would order again. fits ok.  tks these are  so comfortable, wow! they fit as expected! the length fell perfect, just on top of my foot! i am 5\\'5.5&#34; i love these, but any curdling or cellulite is seen...may want to wear longer shirt or spanks or go to yoga! i\\'m tall and usually wear a size 7 in jeans.  these have a nice and stretchy waist.  i was worried they would be to tight or short but they are perfect. came promptly in the mail even tho i accidentally goofed on the address, and are nice and smooth to feel very comfortable :) i bought it for my daughter age 10, tall around 5 feet. the medium size fit her well. the straps were a little long, probably because her chest is small, but an easy fix with safety pins. the dress was beautiful! the quality good. good for the price, fits good!! capri is perfect.  just need to get use to using these to swim.  prefer plain colored top with these jazzing designed pants. looks high waisted but not much room in the rear. pretty! i bought 2 scrubs from this brand and they\\'re perfect! fit great and very comfy !! these pants are wonderful! i\\'m 5\\'6 and 130 lbs, purchased a medium and they fit great. not too tight, not too loose. they aren\\'t at all see through. i got a pair in all black. i used prime shipping and they arrived on the expected delivery day. very much satisfied! i got these for my 9 year old daughter. it fits her perfectly (she is thin but tall). i would imagine it would be tough fitting an actual adult however. just got these today and i love them more then i thought i would. i wanted a pair of white jeans, for the longest and thought i would try theses out. i took a risk buying from online but it all worked out in the end. the reason i gave it 4 stars is because when i took the pants out of the package, some of the gems came off and loose, not really a big thing but still. i can fix that with some fabric glue. also the price is great for these. i got these for a friend and she loves them, came on time an its a great fit made for people with bigger hips but overall it fit nicely with the too folded and they are really warm 8/10 :) bought for mom and she loves it. fits perfectly and light and comfortable very comfortable and a nice fit. the fabric is soft and lightweight she loved them pants fit perfect.  love the pockets and stretch waist with draw cord.<br />the shorts are almost the right length.  i\\'m short so was surprised they were not longer on me. i love it! it works perfect for my tardis outfit when going to the conventions and i will definitely be wearing it again. i just had a baby and these pants fit me well.  they are long enough for me and im 5\\'10&#34;. they are nice quality. these were a hit. i won 2 costumes contests. i would definitely not recommend them if you were bigger than an 8. i\\'ve been buying koi uniforms for a long time. i\\'m always happy with them. these are beautiful! thou i must say it does run on the small side. i\\'m 5\\'2\\\\\\\\\" & if i were much taller they would be on the short side! i weight 117 & they aren\\'t lose! i didn\\'t think they could really be as cute as pictured but they are! i love them i just may get another color! i detest tight clothes, so the fact that it was somewhat large was a plus for me.  i just ordered a size down. great quality, fits well. very comfy and stylish. can be dressed up or down. exactly what i was looking for. would reccomend for most sizes. a++++++++++ these pants do not look like the same color or print in person and the material is kinda hard and very thin and still after i tried them on i walked right over to my computer and ordered another pair! they are so comfy and the style is so unique. i can live with the slight changes in color and print and they are bulgy enough to be on the thin side. hope they hold up after washing. these are my favorite pants in my closet! i am a size uhhhemm- 14 and i bought 3xl they fit perfectly! they are so silky but yet i can wear in summer or winter and they are uuuuber comfy! must buy ten times over in every color! overall positive experience with these pants: i am 5’5 125 lbs, with a runner’s physique.  the elastic waist is the best part of these parts. it is a flattering look and comfortable.  i wish the pants were just a bit longer.  since i have a small waist/butt and thicker thighs & calves, the pants sit a little higher above my ankle than i like. on a thinner leg the length would be ideal. they are perfect with ankle boots though. these are worth the money and arrived fast. thanks! came in on time and was wrapped up good. sizes are the way they say they are , i\\'m 5\\'1 weigh 115 size i got was medium.  the material was good for the price. i like the way they look and feel real comforable good price also going to tell my sister about them these were very nice pants and fit me well in the size 12, even though i normally wear a size 8 or 10.  i ordered a size larger after reading other reviews.  i am 5\\'8&#34; and have long legs.  these pants were just a little too short for me.  with the detailing on the back they are also for casual wear. the material is kinda thin. perfect!!!  excellent quality, very pretty.  got lots of compliments and asked where i got them.<br />would highly recommend them. the pants are great, good quality and the size is ok for me i bought for my vacations in the beach and was very confortable  to use whith my bikini. these pants are amazing. i was really hesitant about ordering them from the 1 review that\\'s been written. i decided to take a chance and i\\'m glad i did. i do agree that the leather strip down the sides of the legs are a little too wide and the bottom does flare out just a little but these were not a deal breaker for me. i ordered a size 18. they\\'re not too tight and not too loose. they\\'re just right. i\\'m also about to order a 16 for when my weight goes down and a 16 won\\'t look too scandalously tight. the 18 is conservative right now. i got a total of 6 in the last 2 years. i plan on buying at least 3 more over next few months just got mine today!  great quality.<br />true to size. love the logo! better than expected :) excellent product so comfy! ordered one size up as recommended by other reviews and they fit great. they are very comfortable but very see through, watch out for what underwear you wear with them. i love these pants just great for summer a little overpriced but oh well. i hope after wash they still look the same the purple in the pic is more of a plum, but it\\'s more of a true purple than the pic, which is what i was hoping for. beautiful color.<br />ordered a large and it fit true to the size chart. like the other reviewer said, it can be difficult to find them to fit if you\\'re not tiny, but these fit me and i\\'m a 12 to 14. i\\'m 5\\'4&#34; and they are a tad long, but will be fine. if you\\'re taller than 5\\'6&#34;, they might be too short. they have a slit to the knee, so it\\'s helpful for movement. i could see myself even wearing these out with a pair of platforms. i think the price is a bit too high, but they are cute and comfy and i know that they will get a lot of wear. hope they hold up well! washes and wears well. very durable. high quality. only wish it had front pockets, but understand this style doesn\\'t have pockets.  really like this color. unique. these pants look and feel great on. the only issue is that they are starting to unravel a bit but i guess that is why they were so cheap. i truly love the look though so i will probably buy again since they don\\'t cost that much money. i have a small upper body and torso, so the pants fit perfectly and the top was a little big, but i still love the set. great purchase! i will probably be buying more in different colors. these fit perfectly. i wear a size 18 in jeans and ordered the 2x just to be sure they\\'d fit. i don\\'t find them to be see through as many others did, but i did order the black. they look very stylish and have a nice swing to them. i absolutely love them. very comfy. can be dressed up with a nice top or dressed down with converses and a tee. i was concerned because some ratings had these as too tight or not high rise enough. i am 6\\' and skinny, these leggings are long enough to fit into combat boots, the material is good and i\\'ll defintely buy more for this amazing price. highly recommend love it finally after 11 years together, i bought my wife a clothing item....she didn\\'t want to return or make faces at...lol these pants are gorgeous! the colors are bright and texture and feel of the material is great. not the best construction, but it fits the bill. i would say they run a tad small. i am usually an extra small, and the small in this brand fits not as loose as i would expect. they arrived two weeks before the earliest estimated date, which says great things about the seller too. good fit nice fit i think i was just hoping they would fit.  looks like i need to lose some weight.  cute pants though. considering the price, these pants are a terrific deal. the fabric, cotton with spandex, is fairly heavy, like the old days, before chinese engineers put their ingenuity to making fabrics as thin as possible. it\\'s comfortable, too.<br /><br />the seams around the waist are banded; how often do you see that these days?<br /><br />i take a curvy size 10-12 and the size 10 in these pants fits me like a glove. (i need to find out if they will shrink.)<br /><br />yes, they are long -- i\\'m about 5\\'2&#34; -- but i\\'ve found i have to hem most pants any way. comfy fit.  higher waisted than i thought.  not a bad purchase overall. i love these pants. they were thin. heavier material though. perfect length for me. (i\\'m 5\\'10&#34;) would definitely recommend this pants are light weight and super comfortable.<br />love them. 😍 i was glad the cut was so generous - i don\\'t like tight pajamas.  i also liked the material and the pattern. thanks i love these pants. the material is like the soft t-shirt material you find in comfy clothes. great even for summer time in phoenix, az they are nice to wear and fit ok, the best scrubs in the market i want to say because the price is reasonable for the product in my opinion... i order size xxs even though i should go for xs according to the chart because xs was too big for me and they don\\'t shrink even after you wash them and dry them for 70 minutes... i have these in 3 different colors and i will be getting more... i just wished more colors were available for my size... love these pants!  am getting a second pair.<br>great for working out, lounging, and sleeping.  cute enough to wear anywhere! love it. runs a size small.  i ordered one size up and fits perfect!  these pants are not made cheap; they are heavy and quality material.  they don\\'t fit too low or too high on waist or too tight and they are very comfortable.<br />the snap is a little bit hard to snap and unsnap, but i like these pants so much and bought more! i just got these and they were really worth the wait. they are inexpensive for high quality. obviously they took long to arrive, they shipped from far away. and i\\'m ok with it. they are amazing. i knew what  i was getting into with the upside down crosses, because... i have eyes. also, these didn\\'t have the burned plastic smell a lot of people spoke of, so maybe they perfected the screening.<br /><br />all in all, i love these leggings. they are so comfortable these trousers were the perfect size and length. will most certainly buy again i love these leggings! i live in washington state and we have really harsh winters. i bought these just as we started getting freezing temperatures and they are really warm. i love the color because they are really black (not faded black) and they are really soft. i read some other reviews that said it ran small so i got a size up and they were really big. also, a lot of lint and other materials get stuck to them easily. other than that they were great! i recommend them to anyone that wants warm leggings. these pants are so great for lounging but can also be paired with a casual tee for a comfortable everyday look. good! i already had one pr. of these pants and loved them , they were perfect and i expect to wear them for a long time. great light weight fabric! fits great! i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; and @ 160 lbs. low-rise waist.<br />con - fabric does pick up lint and cat hair. i wish i could by more of these pi\\'s!  yes, they are not thick, but as much as i like to wear fleece to hang out in, it makes me way too hot.  these are soft, comfortable and fits wonderfully. great fit!!! beautiful print!! love these pants thank you very comfortable, even more so after soaking in some fabric softener during hand washing.  care sheet included recommends hand washing. they seem pretty sturdy but fabric may not hold up well in machine wash. i didn\\'t want to take a chance. faint bleeding of color on initial wash. i used the air dry setting - no heat in my dryer for these - a bit quicker than line drying and they were softer from tumbling. i would not put in dryer on any settings that involved heat.  these seem to get softer with wear also. great for lounging, camping, yoga, etc. bought a few more pairs in the shorter length for summer. the fabric is lightweight and comfortable on a hot day but should be fine for spring and fall also in midwest. plenty of room for another layer underneath if needed. sizing accurate- these are a bit larger than many harem/ fishing type pants. would comfortably fit women xl/ men 38-40 and probably a size or two bigger (but probably would not be able to fold fabric on side, just fold top down over ties.) would be fine for someone much smaller also.  the ties do stay tied which was a concern when buying but i have not had any issues. these stay in place and can be adjusted to variety of sizes and can be pulled up with waist rolled if you do not want them so saggy in the crotch.  (perfect pants to lend to house guests and make a great gift if you do not know someone\\'s size! ) i want them in more colors. so comfortable and look great! perfect without details , color is beautiful. thanks i just received these pants in the mail and tried them on immediately. i love how they look and feel. the tummy panel comes up high, completely covering my belly, which is much better than the shorter maternity panels that slide down all the time. as far as size, i am 5\\'10&#34; and my pre-pregnancy weight was 129 lbs. and i wore a size 2/4 in tall. due to morning sickness, i put on just over 20 lbs. in my first trimester. currently, i am 161 lbs. in my third trimester. so, i decided to order the medium although i would typically be a small and the medium fit great. hopefully that will help other shoppers determine size when ordering these pants. i wasn\\'t sure how i would like these, but they are the most comfortable pants i have worn in a long time! in the picture it looks like navy blue, but it\\'s not it\\'s more like a light royal blue. weird thing is that in pictures it looks darker.. but that could just be the fabric. the fabric!! the only reason why this item is not getting 5 stars, the fabric is a weird nylon/lycra (swimsuit type) stretch blend. it\\'s airy and perfect for the beach but elsewhere it will look weird to wear. for the price i recommend it! love thesepants only wish they had more colors to choose from loved them!! great buy love, love these.  my second pair and will probably buy more. i\\'m 5\\' 10&#34;, 175lbs and they fit just great, even had to trim some off the length and they still touch the floor.  i\\'m always where i got them. i just bought the turquoise stripe pant and jacket, what a great looking suit! i love it, it is super flattering and perfect for spring/summer months. i loved the pants so much that i bought them in white, khaki, and green stripe....it doubled my working wardrobe for less money!! fit nicely, they feel good on.being petite they are a bit long but that can be remedied. other than that i\\'m satisfied with my purchase. this is a must have for bigger or wider girl sizes. this works perfect on any day or occasion with or without your tank tops, shirts, and blouses. i love the fact i can adjust the length and pull it up to cover my extra body fat really high or really low. pumps, flats. and boots go great with this. good for dancing, laying around the house or on the job. just loose and comfortable clothing as can be. i really love these leggings! i\\'m a nerd at heart so these definitely speak to me! the material is really nice i like it a lot! and also not super high waisted as other leggings are. i\\'m 5\\'0\\'\\' and they fit me perfectly at the hips and aren\\'t too long on the legs which is always an issue for me since i\\'m small. all in all, i love these! and i\\'m already buying more from this same seller! i loved them so much i ordered 2 both in two different sizes and i can fit both of them. they fit great i ordered petite and these were way to long good price for these leggings. love them love the material! fits like a glove. comparable to greys anatomy scrubs, but half the price. only scrubs i\\'ll be wearing now! i am very happy with these pants. i can wear them around the house on my day off, or for sleeping when i go visit my family. they are the best fitting lounge pants i have ever owned. i love these pants. likes i liked these pants so much i got a second pair, they are very comfortable & they wash up so nice . would recommend them to anybody . they are comfortable with excellent packing. love it was a gift to my wife. this fits good and looks cute. i just got mine and i love it, looks exactly like the picture. the only thing is the sizing, i  read the reviews and got a way bigger size then what i normally wear. i normally wear a size lg in scrubs but i ordered a 2x for the monkey scrubs. when i opened it i was glad i ordered the 2x because their 2x looks like a normal large. fit well and are flattering perfect fit, nice fabric, and great cut great pants love them i looked all over amazon to find zebra striped leggings, specifically. i read so many reviews that said that the other leggings ripped easily and were of poor quality. i took a chance and chose these leggings, although this product had no reviews. i received them in the mail and they were in perfect condition, no rips or tears when i put them on. the material that these are made of is a kind of silky texture, so i don\\'t think that these would rip easily. very good quality. i\\'m a short, thick girl, so they were a little long for me, but i already expected that when i ordered them. i\\'m very happy with these leggings, and seeing as how this has no reviews so far, i\\'m posting this to encourage people to order these, rather than waste your money on the other leggings that will be ruined within 5 minutes of wearing them. love love love these pants. fits great & love the color, it\\'s my favorite. i love these! only thing is i wish they weren\\'t so long. i\\'m 5/5 1/2, and they are too long, even while wearing danskos which are 1-2&#34; high. these made me look good. highly recommend! these pants fit well at the wait and are one of my favorites! however, this is my third pair and every pair is a completely different length. one pair did not need to be hemmed after a trip through the dryer (not manufactuerer recommended) and the other two needed to be hemmed 2-3 inches for my 5ft4in height. very comfortable my favorite pajamas! i am 5\\'4&#34; 125lbs and the small fits great! good quality and sooo soft! the women\\'s bamboo yoga pants are incredible!  not only is the material plush, but it\\'s substantial enough to wear outside the yoga studio. the sizing is perfect and the pants move with me like a second skin. love them!!!! i love the fit, very light and airy. i recommend it. nice fit and the waist didn\\'t cut into my sidesk after 8 hours at work. love these pants!  i was expecting the background color to be black,  but they are blue. still really like tho! absolutely love, love these! wonderful fabric and so comfortable. thank you i absolutely love them and look forward to purchasing more items like these. :) i am normally a little wary about buying clothes online because you can never be sure the quality or sizing of the clothing. i was very pleased with these causal pants though. i was happy to find that they fit perfectly, both around my waist and my legs. the style of these pants leave the top/waste part a little baggy which can take some getting use to if you have never worn pants like that before. at first i admittedly was not a fan of the style but after having them on for a few minutes it grew on me and i actually started to really like it. when i first pulled the pants out of the packaging i could tell that the quality of the clothes was cheap. it had a \\'hefty\\' feel to it without being heavy. they have a light \\'flowy\\' feeling to them but are not a thin cloth that will likely rip or tear easily. product was purchased for the purpose of review. overall i was very happy with these pants and amazed to find that i really enjoyed this new style. look real. very comfortable fabulous. true size 6. i love these pants you can dress them up an derss them casual. an they stay cool. i love these pants they aren\\'t as high as i thought they would be they reach right below my belly button but i still love them.. the material is strechy so they don\\'t suffocate you and they don\\'t fade ! i bought them in 4 colors i liked that they were soft and easy for my legs to breath in. though the length was a little smaller than i had hoped but they are still really good pants to work out in. i choosed it for the way it look, very relax on your body. it fits my figure the way i expected, very comfortably i am a person who normally does not get cold.  however, getting older now has proven to me, old bones do not like the cold when sitting still.  i purchased these to put on in the evenings when watching tv.  we keep our heat set at about 68 degrees and sometimes when it has been a hard day, i find i get chilled.  these are great.  nice and warm and roomy enough that i don\\'t feel restrained when squirming in my chair due to restless legs.  even the dog loves snuggling nest to me in the chair!  love these bottoms! of all the pants i did buy with a stretchy waistband (vs belly coverage) this on has been the best. no sagging, comfy, love the color and quality of the material as well. if you like harem pants these are it!  they are soooooooo comfortable, beautiful color (i chose green).  how they wash will tell the whole story - i haven\\'t done that yet. very slenderizing and flattering. a lot of bang for your buck. bought these since soft pants are in and these are so cute!  i wear them with a plain black top and sandals and it looks very stylish.  i ordered the 3xl (i\\'m a 16/18) and they fit perfect! love these! wore them this past weekend. they are flattering.  need some cooler weather to enjoy them some more..... they are perfect for  3 seasons out or 4.............. the leggings fit perfectly, give support and are very light.  ithe are skin tight, do it\\'s important that you wear a long shirt or blouse over them.  great for 9 months of the year in southern california, where i live. nice pants great pair of leggings and match the picture exactly. i\\'d recommend washing them inside out so you don\\'t lose color. these cargo pants are awesome for the price.  rich green in color with numerous metal-hardware, snap pockets.  the material is difficult to describe, but it has no &#34;give&#34;, so pay close attention to all the measurements (which i did not, so they did not fit me).  the material is not thin, nor is it thick, so it\\'s perfect for cool summer nights, fall or spring.  love the details... such as ties at the leg bottoms for a cute tied look.  if my body type would fit, i would order again. this item is true to it\\'s picture....very nice.  i\\'m currently loosing weight & can\\'t weight to fit into these beauties.  not as much stretch as i thought.  i purchased a lrg...& perhaps an x-lrg was needed.  however, these beauties are lovely.  i order brown for my curvaceous curvs. ordered a medium, fits great! everyone loves them! very satisfied true to size great fit and perfect size, they worked great. good they arrived quickly! i am so pleased with the fit. i have a size -26-27 waist and they are perfect! they are so cute and comfortable i actually just bought another pair! super isnt because will give more protection. but because it is giant. sometimes i use it like a shorts. but it rolls up my leg. i liked it anyway finding exactly what you want and then having it fit is almost a gift! so thank you. i love these pants i where them all the time and my husband always get jealous. my teenage granddaughter loves these pajama bottoms. they are very comfortable. love love love! great feel, good quality, and love the design. i was afraid it\\'ll be too big since it\\'s a one size fit all, but it was perfect for me. i\\'m 5\\'1&#34; and 115lbs, with a muffin top. the waistband was wide and stretchy but super comfortable because it was thin, and covered up my bits of extra and made me look better.  i\\'ll be wearing these everywhere this summer! in fact, i might buy another pair in a different print right now! the pants are comfortable, but are a little long. love these!!! i have 2 pair now. i always hated wearing skirts until i found<br />pettipants. i guess i did not like thighs rubbing, stickiness feeling of wearing<br />a slip and a skirt. the pettipants are ultra comfortable as they are soft cotton.<br />i am a size 6 and i ordered a medium which was perfect for me.<br />don\\'t hesitate you will love them. my cousin gave me a pair of the fold over pants similar to these in a size medium which fit nicely, so i figured that i would purchase these in a large for more comfort and they fit tighter then the fold over mediums....i guess its extra encouragement to lose a little more weight.... based on other reviews as well as the chart, i decided to order the xl. i\\'m 5\\'5&#34;, 180lbs, my chest is 36-38 dd, waist is 34 and hips are about 41-42. the xl fit perfectly. not too snug but just enough...i didnt have any problems with getting them up at all. the l probably would have fit but with much struggle and then after a good wash might not fit anymore. i haven\\'t washed these yet but i plan on washing them in cold water and hanging to dry. i would definitely buy these again. oh and the material is a little thin.. i love the faded glory jeggings from walmart and i usually wear a l in those, but sometimes i cant get to the store in time to get the nice colors before they sell out. they fit well, a little tight (29&#34; waist, 36&#34; hips) and a bit thinner than i expected but still very cute and good for the price! these are very comfortable , perfect for summer. i have never owned a pair of pants like these but i am in love! they are the most comfortable breathable pants i own. great product and service love them. i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; 130lbs. i ordered medium and the length is perfect...dislike short palazzos.  but they do grow some as you wear, so probably could wear small but i prefer a relaxed fit. great fit. long in the legs which is a bonus. i love the fit of this! it was perfect on me.  i\\'m 5\\'5 115 lbs 34c and 25 inch waist.  i got an xs.  not sure if it would work on anyone taller because it\\'s pretty high waisted.  i gave it 4 stars because of the material.  it feels like a tent but it\\'s airy and good for hot days. i was afraid the  material would be see through because it\\'s thin, but the black wasn\\'t bad at all.  overall, i like it.  got a lot of compliments. love these pants! super comfy very comfortable pendleton pants.  flattering, drapes very well, and no wrinkles!  great for travel.  only wish they had pockets, and then they would be perfect! i wear these pants for everything; workouts, yoga, running errands or relaxing. comfort and style are not compromised for function. they are so very comfortable; the stretch bamboo fabric keeps you warm in the winter but cool in the summer.  i look and feel 10 pounds lighter when wearing all devigi products – they are flattering and cover up my flaws. i have put these pants through the washer/ dryer cycle (at a minimum) 52 times and when i ordered an additional pairs,  i could not tell the old pair from the new.  i’m excited to have 5 pairs of these pants so i can get rid of all of my frumpy old workout clothes. they fit well.  i am 5\\'2&#34; and very happy with these.  i prefer to wear them in cooler weather.  they are a bit warm.  my main concern was if they would be too long, but they weren\\'t. i could seriously live in these pants and have already ordered in another color. wide waistband sits perfectly on your hips or can be pulled up a little higher to cover your belly. so comfortable. thin fabric is great for warm weather without being sheer. i get compliments every time i wear these! yes love these pants.  material is high quality and very soft.  pants do run larger than normal, however i will certainly be ordering these in more colors. i\\'m glad i went one size smaller! they are a great color, true to the picture. i will order them again! i got this product as a gift. my daughter loved it said it was just what she wanted. true to size and fit. the gift even came faster than expected. i own two pairs of these and two other pairs of lysse faux jeans.  i *love* them--super comfy and stretchy. thank you the only thing  preventing me from giving a 5  star is that they hang a little low between your legs & feels kinda awkward , but i got mostly use to it. for price good buy. i love these yoga pants. i can\\'t wait to order more. i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; about 140 lbs. i got a medium. they fit and feel fantastic. i can breathe and move perfectly. a must have! great pair of swim shorts!  well made and true to size fit! i needed some casual, inexpensive petite pants to add to my wardrobe for work.  it fit rather tight in the waist and on my hips.  otherwise, it is an easy care item that fits in the permanent press category. this is the second pair i have bought. i have corral and mocha and bought my mother the coral also. i love the fit and they are so comfortable. i dress them up for church and work or throw on with a solid tee for comfortable days these pants are so cute.  the colors are so vibrant and the print is gorgeous!  i love how the fabric falls at  the hips.  it gives some added curves in that area, which i like.  i already have hips but these pants make them look more flattering.<br /><br />if you like bold prints you won\\'t be disappointed with these. overall i love the jumper it\\'s a tad bit too big but i still love it .i\\'m a size 16 i ordered a extra large an i had room in it .. these pants are very nice and soft.  very comfortable.  they can be worn out on a fun day or simply to relax in the home.  i bought several pairs i wear a size 6 in pants and the small fit perfectly. i am 5\\'6&#34; and the pants are a little bit long but since they do not have a hem; they can be easily trimmed. if you are shorter; they will definitely be too long. my company was having a back to the 60&#34;s party and i found these. they were exactly what i was looking for and worked very well. gotta love koi.  these are the only pants i buy for work.  love the fit and all of the extra pockets. great! i am very happy with the quality and the shipping was very fast. they run big but other than that i love these pants the only brand i buy! i really love the vibrancy of these tights. i am 5\\'2&#34; and about 130lbs. they were a little tight but not too bad ( ive got alot of &#34;junk in the trunk&#34;). still awesome for the price! love the skirt! i\\'m small and i order medium i liked the soft textile its really nice so comfortable and feels so light it just out line the nice cures in the body :) just love it i love the colors, these are a lot of fun. they are a bit tight though at the thigh, so perhaps i should have gotten a bigger size. still love them and will wear them. love this look . so fun to wear. very comfortable scrubs. nice color and fit. very happy with quality great!! thank you very much i love this product i recommended a 100% to everyone need a confortable pants to wear muy buena pieza, 100% recomendable.... pants are wonderful, easy on with much comfort to yoga.  would recommend for a very comfortable workout pant. these are the most comfortable pants.  they have a good flowy look with a snug waist to make them quite attractive.  love them! really good amazinnnnngggggggg... great fit and nice material i absolutely love the fit and style of these seersucker pants.i was so impressed with the workmanship that i bought the jacket and skirt. i used to be an eileen fisher fan,not anymore.isaac mizrahi quality and fit is perfect.keep them coming please. excelente great pant for work, but the cut wasn\\'t for me, so they were returned. cute! i love the &#34;no line&#34; waist band! the white stripes down the side are somewhat sheer but overall, i really like these workout pants. comfy and it fits perfect my fiance loves owls and loves the softness of the pajamas. it\\'s a great but and she loves wearing them. we\\'ve had it for a couple of months and it\\'s going well for now. i love these lounge pants! the fleece is very thick and soo soft, plush and comfy. the patterns are fun and cute. they seem well made in the seams, i haven\\'t washed them yet so i don\\'t know how they\\'ll hold up, but so far so good. fantastic product and the seller sent the items very fast. i had to come back and order more of these for my daughter! to my surprise, i really liked this, enough that i\\'m considering getting one in black as well. i was a bit wary of buying a romper - i don\\'t exactly have amazing thighs - but i\\'m glad i bought it. this actually looks pretty good on, especially with some semi-opaque black pantyhose. the fabric of this item is of reasonable quality, the color (teal) is as pictured, and it\\'s comfortable. the only thing i don\\'t like is that the tie that is attached to it is really long - however, this is easily remedied by double wrapping it.<br /><br />for reference, my measurements are 5\\'8&#34; and approx 42-30-43 (inches), and i got an xl. these pants are really nice and comfy.  i have a little extra room in them but i don\\'t like my pants skin tight so it works for me. i also think these pants look better with a little room to them. i can\\'t wait too wear them!! these shorts are so comfy, fir perfectly, and look great. very good material for the price. these are the very best all-around lounging pants i\\'ve ever come across ... great for my daily walk (5 miles), and time on our sailboat! the guy who - there was just barely enough room for a 50&#34; waistline perhaps didn\\'t/doesn\\'t know there are plus-size versions of these pants on amazon. i\\'m happy with the regular size, and can get plenty of fold in the front for a nice, easy fit;i\\'m not overweight, but i\\'m not a skinny-minnie, either! i can adjust the length by how much i fold over the top, so they fit even a short person (5\\'2&#34;) like me! i\\'m shopping for my second pair right now!<br /><br />only caveat is to be sure to wash these separately or with like colors ... they will bleed for quite a few washes. so, unless you like a blue tint to everything, head\\'s up! light weight, fit comfortably, and long inseam. i love love love these pants will definitely be buying more. love how they shape my curves lift my butt and slim my legs these pants are great! i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; 125 lbs and the tall length is perfect. would\\'ve given 5 stars but the material attracts lint. i have the black and the gray are on their way!! i am wearing these today and have received multiple compliments. they are extremely comfortable. they are long on me but i\\'m 5\\'2&#34;. the pants fit comfortably, and i am a size 11-12. they can stretch to fit anywhere from really small sizes to a size 14 (possibly a 16, but that might be pushing it). they are comfortable, arrived quickly, and look great. i wear them all the time for practice. the mesh and fabric mix is a very eye-catching combination, and adds to the beauty and allure of the dance. i loved them so much i ordered every color they offer! and the free shipping was a very nice bonus! i ordered a pair of leveret pants as i wanted these for work. reviews had said to wash, hang to dry - not to put in dryer.  when they arrived, being too long for my 29&#34; inseam, i had to either hem them or hope the length would shrink but not the waist as i didn\\'t want the waist any tighter - though these are stretchable, the waist area was not so i sent them back and ordered a different pair.  my orders are now showing the same pants but they are different.  the new pants are stretchable all over and very comfortable. i did wash and put in dryer and the length shrunk so they fit and the waist still fits the same - very comfortable.  love these pants! great fit at large and very comfortable! i received these in the mail yesterday in the black color and much sooner than the estimated arrival date said which was nice.  they\\'re pretty awesome and i especially liked the stitching from the side of the hip down the middle of the leg on the front.  it accentuates your shape when they\\'re on and looks good.  i was worried they would fit differently than slim fit jeans, but they don\\'t.  the material isn\\'t shiny or tacky-looking so i could wear them anywhere.  great product. very nice pair of pants! love these pants.  just what i expected and they fit great. these fit better than expected, and we\\'re surprisingly comfortable trampling around brushy fields and barbed wire. i swear these for my meditation yoga class. they\\'re very comfortable, but because i\\'m not 6\\' tall, i have to basically pull these up to my armpit when i put it on and then fold it back down. i recommend giving it a wash before first use because it\\'s a little rough coming out of the package. i love the bag that it comes in though, very stylish. i have 2 pairs of these and the first pair i\\'ve had for about 6 months and it still looks like new. they are a great fabric, a great price, now they have worn down, so they don\\'t last very long, ive had them for roughly under a year, but they are worth it love these pants, definitely buying in more patterns. i\\'m 5\\'7&#34; and they\\'re perfect these fit a lot better than the large thanks my daughter loves these pants! do be warned, as they are faded glory brand, which is walmart\\'s. these pants are very comfortable and fit as expected. i ordered the white ones. the only issue is that the white ones are a little bit see-through. will definitely need to wear white underwear with them. otherwise, they are perfect! i purchased a pair of the joe b pants in black size 5 a few years ago for work and am still wearing them! this is extremely exciting for the following reasons:<br />1. it means i am the same size! (which means i can continue to eat junk food)<br />2. it means the quality of joe b pants is great and that i\\'ve definitely gotten my money\\'s worth by purchasing these pants.<br />these pants are in my &#34;weekly rotation&#34; of work pants meaning i typically wear them once a week. i wash and dry them with all of my other dark clothes at home as well. i haven\\'t noticed any (or much) fading of color since i purchased them either.<br />i typically wear a 27x33 in jeans and i\\'m about 5\\'8&#34; and these pants are a great length to wear with flats to work. they are also very comfortable to wear and good for all weather types as i wear them year round and just pair with different tops! i know what to replace them with when they finally do kick the bucket! love the material! so soft and comfortable! runs on the small side so order up a size. love them.  long but i\\'m only 5\\'2&#34; i bought two pairs of these pants; one at my regular size and another one size bigger per other buyers. i should have stayed with my regular size because the m was way too big on me. they are comfortable though and the one pair that fits me helped me survive the extreme heat in india. i am returning the medium. i am a small petite 5\\'5&#34; 130lbs and i got the medium which fits perfectly..  they feel wonderful, stylish, my wife likes them, and did i mention they feel great?  a cool trend if you are in that kind of thing they are extremely soft and comfortable and you could wear all day long .i ordered  m size n it is just great, color is depicted as in picture pretty color and super comfortable love them !! i just got these pants delivered today. i\\'m glad i listened to the other reviewers and ordered up in size. i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; and 127 lbs. i ordered a large and they are really snug. i can\\'t imagine squeezing into a smaller size. i really like the weight and feel of the neoprene fabric. i ordered them to wear kayaking and i\\'m optimistic about them keeping my lower body warm and dry on chilly outings! these are so cute. i\\'m a medium and it fits perfectly. of course i bought one for my sister too. she also loves it very much. she wears it around alot. love, love, love these pants! hope they keep these in stock as i want a pair in every color! these are great.  fit great! these fit as expected, were a good height for me (i am 5\\'3 and tend to be petite so they were a touch long but nothing a pair of shoes didn\\'t fix!)  they are soft, comfortable and great to wear both in and out of the house! great deal for yoga/lounge pants! very soft and comfy. fabric is a little thin, so i\\'m not sure they\\'ll last too long, but they work! so after reading all of the negative reviews about this product i decided to roll the dice and see what happens.  overall they were exactly what i expected and a great bargain.  they are cheap, imitation black milk leggings and for 9.00 i\\'m not complaining. the fit great, and the image is fairly vibrant. when stretched it does fade a tad bit beggars can\\'t be choosers. they are definitely see thru in the butt area. i\\'d wear them to the gym, just not on leg day. exactly what i expected these are exacty what they\\'re supposed to be.  sizing is good. theyre stretchy. long enough. comfortable to move around.<br />plus they are attractive for just wearing around .  i will buy more in colors. i love the way they fit but the length is way to short. i\\'m 5\\'9 and these are like capries on me. luckily i wear boot\\'s most of the time so it wasn\\'t a complete issue. however if your tall and do not wear above ankle boots, then i don\\'t suggest these... unless you want capries. am happy despite the reviews i\\'ve read thes pants fit great the size 8 were too big but these fit me really well they are a size 6 i like my clothes to fit a little big these do but not so large that theyll end up around my ankles love the design and fit its okay... i like it.. when i saw the low price i wasn’t sure what to expect i would get in the mail. i decided to order them any way and they came early and promptly and im really surprised that the color looks great on me! ill probably order one more pair in the future as a backup pai, although these ones seems stury! an xl fits me well and i\\'m a size 22pant. my waistline & legs sweat a lot when i wear these during my workout. highly recommended!! so i\\'ve worn these on several occasions and have been given plenty of compliments on how awesome they are. i\\'m a little over 5\\'3\\\\\\\\\" and weigh about 155lbs and have had no problems with the size or fit. the leggings are a bit thin on my tush but that isn\\'t a problem with a long shirt to cover. the rest of the leggings were fine if not a little long near the ankles but nothing a little adjusting can\\'t fix. i had no problem with the white of the leggings not being white enough on my legs and i have big calves and thick thighs. my skin is also on the tan side if that helps. fits very well. to be honest, my roommate told me these tapered pants looked a little \\\\\\\\\"mom-ish\\\\\\\\\". they have a higher waist and the legs aren\\'t super tight all the way down. but the fabric is very beautiful so i kept them just to wear to work.  these are lined on the inside, so are great for fall and winter.<br /><br />they\\'re just a tad too long on me (i\\'m 5\\'6\\\\\\\\\")- they will look better with heels than flats for sure, but don\\'t need the extra work of getting hemmed. comfortable, wish they were a different material than the slippery kinda shiny material that it is though. the best leggings!!! i am a curvy girl and these fit just fine! the material was thick and i could play they down or up depending on the occasion. i already bought 4 pairs!!! i love these i ordered the tall after reading all the reviews about this product.  now i\\'m stepping on the back of the pant leg, i\\'m 5\\'6 and have pretty long legs.  the reviews that i read warned against shrinkage, i did not find this to be the case.  other than the length, the pants are great!  you can dress them up for work, looks very professional. omggggg, i love this pants. the fit. the colour gray . the material. there is not one thing i do not love about this pants. it keeps me warm in chill places and surprisingly it keeps me comfortable enough in heat. i am in love with this pants i will encourage anyone to purchase this pants because it is true to the fit and colours.  i myself have purchased more than one. cute and fits awesome the colors are very bright. i would have preferred them just a little bit more muted. these are hippie pants, for sure. these are way beyond bohemian. these are 1968. i remember because i was there. that\\'s okay, but i still wish the colors were a little bit muted. these will be comfortable and cool......and get a lot of attention. more than you need, perhaps. i love them!  they\\'re perfect for what i wanted. 3rd set for my wife. she loves them. very comfy - but thin, so don\\'t expect to be outside in these as if they are sweatpants!  perfect for yoga, stretching, sleeping..:) fit as expected. cute jeans. i love these tights fit great length perfect,price right i\\'m going for other colors, this is a very nice pair of paints.  classy and sassy!  love em.  definately have to have the in white! these pants are amazingly comfortable. thin so not winter wear at all but great for summer. great for raves and flow arts. a little long for shorter people as i\\'m 5\\'1&#34; and they drag quiet a bit. but i wouldn\\'t trade these for the world. i can\\'t wait to get more of these pants. i got the red and black ones. great fleece pants -- soft and flattering cut and a playful print. good service from seller. i highly recommend these if you don\\'t want to  look too lumpy in your comfy pants. great pants. they look really nice and they are super stylish. i love it great fit and very comfortable, very good price and on time delivery! i really like these! good (written by the wife) i\\'m a size size small 2-4 us, and the large is just right, although not as high-waisted as i\\'d like because they\\'re asian-made pants and curves limit how high the waist will go.<br /><br />fit as expected, but definitely, unless you have very narrow hips, size up from a small to a large!!!  if you\\'re a medium and not overly wide-hipped you may fit into the large.  the waist-to-hip ratio is less dramatic than us clothing.<br /><br />quality is good, the pants look pretty! they keep their shape and aren\\'t binding at waist.  i love the boot cut.  gives versatile wear in or out of boots. i got an xs but they were still bigger than i expected they would be. wish they had xxs -- i am 5\\'3 and 118 lbs. i really do looove these pants,<br />i usually wear a size 20,<br />so i bought a size 18 due to the reviews saying they\\'re a size bigger than the usual.<br />should have went down one more size.<br /><br />still like em\\' though :d is it bad i wear these pretty much 24/7 haha i love these pants wearing them now!! awesome easy fit, and just what i wanted. great color! i ha a fantastic experiance with the company. it\\'s nice to know people really care!! the leggings are also exactly what i wanted! well made.  nice weight fabric.  i bought one and really liked them so i got another! very nice quality and feel and fit (a little small though), but too short. i need a minimum of 33&#34; inseem and these are too short. if i pull them down a bit they are almost where i want them, but moving just a little bit causes them to ride back up and be too short again. so sad that these will have to be returned. these are some pretty nice pants. my only problem with them is that i found that they have a tendency to tear around the belt loops and the buttons don\\'t like to stay on. the rest is quite durable, though, and all the pockets are really handy. i purchased larger size hoping for a better fit.. but i think i should have stuck  to my actual size. great fit and the length was perfect. love them . i ordered a small. i\\'m 5\\'7inches tall.. so if this gives you an idea of the length..and i wear a size two in normal women size..so comfy, cool and light weight.. thank you order bigger then your normal size fits a bit tight but i still love them super comfy and good quality silky smooth and very comfortable....bit more baggy than i expected but not too much so that its un wearable ripped and a hole showed on my but hole so it was embarrassing but i had em for a couple of years so wat do you expect right but there good a nice airflow going through my legs and stuff as a person that is always looking for great workout clothes, these were an awesome find. they are not see through and fit at the waist line, therefore i don\\'t have to worry about bending over and exposing anything. they even have a pocket for my key and ipod, which is super convenient. i found a pair of pants that fit, look great, and support a cause all at the same time. the pants fit great but the top is a little bit too small wow i love love these leggings they fit me perfectly and so soft and love the zippers in front. elastic waist that tucks in my tummy actually! perfect pants for me to workout or walk with there so comfortable! im gonna be wearing them on a long trip cause there that comfortable i received this product in exchange for an unbiased review nice love these!! these flannel lounge pants were much better than expected - the fabric is superior and the sizing is just right.  there was no shrinkage after washing so there is no need to order a larger size.  you cannot beat the quality and price of these flannel lounge pants along with the service provided by the supplier. very awesome pants, comfortable and fashionable. they sort of make me feel like a gangster, it makes one feel as if they are bagging... which i\\'m okay with.. sort of actually like. anyways the shipping was super fast! awesome super comfortable fits good it arrived on time, however the crotch was a bit long. i\\'m 4\\'11...so i can understand why. but i\\'ve bought other leather legging pants on amazon before no problem, little disappointed when i got these. however, i do still wear them. it\\'s not that noticeable. i love koi and i received the shipment in a timely mannr.  there are no other scrub pants that are as comfortable as these.  thank you!  great pricing too. my third pair, and i gave one to each of my sons. fit great! perfect fit i bought these to use as part of a halloween costume.  fit is better that i thought for only having one size.  i\\'m a women\\'s size 8-10, and they are comfortable.  they shipped from china and amazon quoted a delivery timeframe of  3 1/2 - 6 weeks.  i had them in 9 days.  i do live in la, so that may be part of the reason it was faster.  i can\\'t speak to their durability, since i just got them, but they seem fine for the price. these are awfully cute which is how i hope to forgive them if they don\\'t hold up in the wash.  i got a lot of compliments on them the first time i wore them but they seemed dangerously close to sliding down too far in my zumba class!  i got a small and the length was perfect, but they just seem a bit loose.  ( i am not quite 5\\'3\\' and about 110 pounds) i think i may always wash them gently and hang them to dry cause they do seem a little flimsy i love these pants!! they are super comfortable, the material is not cheap, and they\\'re looong!! i have long legs, so i usually have a hard time finding pants that are long enough, and these fit the bill! plus, the price is fabulous! was a good product for the price, i like them they were so tiny, so i gave them to my grandaughter for her 21 birthday.  she loved them.  now my other grandaughter wants a pair.  they are really thin, with a liner like shorts.  would not be suitable for a grandmother, but fine for the younger generation,. great lounge pants! very roomy and flattering in the butt department. i bought this set to replace the super baggy cherokee unisex scrubs i had.  these are nice and more fitted, they are not as soft as my greys anatomy scrubs, but they are also half the price.  there are pockets on the top and on the lateral knee, very convenient.  i would recommend them. super comfortable and soft. butt part is flattering but not sure about the droopy pockets that add to hip width from the front. legs taper down to fit tighter. very pleased with the palazzo pants.  very comfortable.  love the fabric... product material is good, expected to fit better! need more size dimensions clear! everything is good, quality and size muy bien i have these pants in multiple colors, they fit well (true to size). amazon has a great price on these! i am 6\\'2&#34; tall with a 36&#34; inseam. the pants are perfectly long and comfy. i am a true size 8 and i ordered a medium. can\\'t wait to purchase more!!! great pants , love the material you would love this pants , so comfortable . these are very good guilty leggings. they fit well and i love the wide wast band. very colorful. i will be buying from seller again. i fell in love with these beauties! i got so many compliments the first day i wore these. they didn\\'t take too long to arrive. they fit well and make me feel good(: literally love these leggings so much. they are comfy, fun, and most definitely an attention getter! they also arrived way earlier than expected which was a bonus. no horrible smell either, that all the other reviews are talking about. i loved how the pants fits perfectly on my hips and is very comfortable to wear it to office and also to a bar or a casual event nice! very nice!! love these leggings ,it fits me well. favorite pilates pants! i enjoyed getting these. they looked as they did in the picture. they are extremely comfortable. they fit me well. but i would definitely be mindful of what size and height you are. the length was fine on me. i am 5\\'6. the fit was also fine on me as far as the waist. they are sheer, as expected. very comfortable for a summer out. they fit perfect. super comfortable fit as expected and love them!  super comfy, especially while pregnant! comfy and a great price, order a size up though!!! just ordered a couple more pair. waaaay too long. nothing petite about the length. i am 5\\'2&#34; and the bottom hem is dragging on ground all around my shoes.  when did the height for petite change to 5\\'6&#34;? bought these for my daughter. she loves them!!!!!! yes so perfect i love this outfit, i bought it for a concert and its amazing i got so many compliments, all though it looks a bit like a swimsuit its still cute i like these jeans and they fit well.  unfortunately the red color shows on the photo as kind of a faded red denim and the actual color is a very vibrant red.  i just hope that they will match the items that i had in mind when i made the purchase. these pants are great. people who buy things without checking their measurements & then say the fit is too small/too big are misleading anyone who reads it. i always make sure i take my measurements and they are correct. according to the reviews, i should have picked a medium. but i ordered a small & the pants fit great, they are only a tiny bit big but i can most definitely wear them without any issue. i am 5\\'5&#34;, 125 lbs w/36&#34; hips & the small fit perfect on me. plus, the buttons seem sewed on pretty tight. with almost all of my office pants, a button or two have come off. all i do is grab a needle & thread & sew it back on. it\\'s not a big deal & very easy to do. great pants but they were just a bit on the large size ... its even better than being naked!! love how the compression feels when working out in these shorts. i am a big fan of flare pants and loud of color! these pants are perfect! i\\'m usually between a medium and small. these fit perfectly and are just what i expected except the elastic around the waist is a bit tight for a one size fits all. great pant fit will too thanks a lot. a snug but comfortable cut, will make sure to wash these in cold water!<br /><br />still, what i\\'d consider a good buy if you\\'re fairly slender thease fit great - i got a s and i\\'m a 27 in jeans. the fit is super comfy with the yogo waist. nice linen pants! i ordered this product on october 1st and got it on october 3rd. i was afraid it wouldn\\'t fit but it fits and is very comfortable. i would definitely consider buying from this seller again. i ordered xl ( im pretty big) and they fit great , i ordered rose and purple, color just like the photo , they are my favorite exercise pants! i love both pair that i got. the color is very vibrant and look exactly like they are pictured. they are very comfortable and the fabric is very good quality. i wore them when it was pretty hot and they were very breathable.they were a little long but easy to cut to them off as they don\\'t have a hem. i got a lot of complements on them so all in all i would buy more! they fit perfectly! i am 5\\'9 and they\\'re perfect length! they\\'re beautiful and i can\\'t wait to show them off! :) these are some of the most comfortable tights/leggings i\\'ve ever had. actually the most comfortable. very soft & non-binding, but still work well under another layer. highly recommend. this comes with a great variety and the price is great! you can be sure that none of your friends will have the same item. each one is super fun and eclectic. i am 4\\'11\\'\\' and about 90 lbs. most adult pants and leggings are terribly long, but these leggings are long by about 4 to 6 inches for me, and they look pretty good once i roll them up once or twice at the bottom. the waistband sits at mid-waist, not high-waisted, so it is not the most comfortable for sitting down in, but it is good that they are not so tight as to be made for those with flat abdomens. nice and soft and plenty long (tall was ordered).  i haven\\'t washed them yet, so cannot report on shrinkage, if any. love jockey scrubs! so soft and comfortable all day. these are a little longer than my other jockey scrub pants but i still love them. i have noticed since it is just now getting cold here in the south that they are not very warm though. so if you are outside any, you will feel the cold! thanks. short and fat my mother looks great in these. a super fupa and she has nothing but complements of how fat she is. i am beyond excited to inform amazon users my mother is huge. its good that the box these came in could not fit through my front door, its not a big deal at all because my mother can not fit through my door either. it\\'s very comfortable and it\\'s flow as you walk, beautiful. after wearing this kind of pant, you don\\'t want to go back wearing jean. good material, but very small. i suggest you order a size up or even two sizes up. i am usually a 0 so i ordered a xs, but they are too tight i fear if i went hiking in them they would not be comfortable. i like the pants though, they seem like great material to hike and stay dry in, so i am returning them for a bigger size. order up. they stretch really easily and are very thin.  good for lounging but i don\\'t think i could wear them to work i just received these today and tried them on. i like them....they\\'re cute. they look like the photo. i should have ordered my size in extra small though because small is a little looser than my husband likes. :-) i was thinking that they run small but they don\\'t. these are also shorts you can bend over in while keeping your personables personal because they hug you. i highly recommend these shorts. update: i had ordered a medium, not a small, not knowing if they ran small. they don\\'t. i should\\'ve ordered the small, but i won\\'t return them. i\\'ll just order more in small, since they don\\'t come in x-small and i really like them. though these pants run a little small, they\\'re still very nice. i\\'ll just get another pair and hope to lose a little weight. very nice for church or a nice evening out. comes with a dangling belt…good quality w/ elastic waist. gave as a gift to my sister (who loves giraffes) and she absolutely loves them. she says they are what she looks forward to putting on after a long day at work. love the feel and fit!! buen producto perfect i took a chance and ordered 3 pair. at 5\\'1 they don\\'t drag on the ground. they fit great. the fabric is thick, so it\\'s not transparent as i read on other reviews. it was nice one, delivered before estimated date. i\\'ll recommend to my friends. i\\'d highly recommend this pair if you really love fleece pant. thanks great straps - would recommend all the previous reviews about the small sizing are correct. got these for my daughter, who is a reg. size 16 with bubblicious glutes, substantial thighs, and athletic calves. they fit her perfectly as a legging that shapes and smooths without strangling her waist or lower body.<br /><br />these pants have a working zipper, fake front pockets with bling rivets at the corners, and a bling button fastener. the back pockets function and are positioned to flatter.<br /><br />a truly plus-sized body won\\'t fit in these pants. best and most comfortable pj pants ever! worth every penny! fit for real women with hips- not too tight! the red ones fit perfect. material is high quality, color is rich. i take size 4/6 more 6 right now and these fit awesome. very nice pants. i  will have to have them  shortened they\\'re longer than i would have liked.  i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; it is very comfy, but the 1x is like a 2x and could probably fit a 3x  but overall nice my son loves it.  fit him perfectly.  great for his aladdin costume.  came in a cute little pouch.  thank you :) very comfortable wearing fabric. the pants hit just below the waist and hug the bottom just enough. the inseam is about 32--perfect for long legs! i really like these pants for lounging at home.  i ordered them specifically for lounging so i ordered up from my usual size of medium and it turns out that the large fit me perfectly.  i can\\'t really comment on how they would perform while doing yoga as this is not something i do, but i have had no issue with the pants slipping down at all.  i do agree with the reviewer that commented that these are not as soft as other texere products, but if you read the description it says they are part cotton which makes them sturdier and not quite so soft.  this texture is fine for pants, but i do prefer the full bamboo on tops.  anyway - i highly recommend these pants. great fitting and comfortable lounge/gym/yoga pants. the white ones are great for walking the boardwalk or beach. they are durable and never too hot to wear or to thin to be chilly in on the breezier days at the ocean. the white ones can actually pass for slacks for semi-casual summer parties and even to go to brunch or church. the white color is the best! nice material gd fit hi,wow-- thank you the material is cheaper than it looks in the picture but it does for nicely .... i do think it\\'s a bit overpriced for the cheapness of the stitching and material. i love palazzo\\'s, i\\'m 5\\'10&#34; and these fit great for length, unrolled with heels, rolled with flats.  very flattering and you feel like you are wearing your pj\\'s but it looks nice and put together.  the print is a bit &#34;busier&#34; than it appears in the photos but still ok with solid shirt. i am 5\\'7 average weight, ordered the large, fit nicely. i really love these pants, wore them snorkeling and boogie boarding. wish i had purchased a pair years ago. good product. thanks! very comfortable these pants are very comfortable and i find them fun to wear. i have a bit of a fluffy tummy after giving birth to my son 6 months ago and these pants are very forgiving. i am a size 8 in woman\\'s or a 12 in juniors and these pants fit perfectly. the material is thin and soft but not so thin that you feel naked. but perfect for summer. i love them. these leggings are super cute and comfortable. however, if they are somewhat see-through. besides that, they are definitely a good buy. great i love these! very comfortable and roomy. i\\'m 5\\'3 and 150lbs. i bought the large. if i were taller they may be too short i love it the top and pants fit a little short.  exchanged for a small.  very comfortable. love them! even better in person! comfy and love them.i am 5 ft 5.5in and around 143 lbs. ordered medium and fits great. they look great on me and comfortable too.  i want to order another pair. i should\\'ve ordered a size bigger, i went with large, they\\'re pretty tight around the waist. there really is no elastic or stretch in the waistline. i\\'m sure losing a couple pounds will get them to fit better, going to put these in my skinny pile. been wearing these pants for years now. the fabric is thin but its very loose fitting so it fine. fun look esp on days when you want comfort. absolutely love the fit and hand feel of the fabric!!!! i was looking for a flared pants for workout since i have plenty of tight ones. this is my first flared pant i bought so i was a bit worried about the style and the size but once i got it, there was no worries whatsoever. the fabric is nice and the style too. it\\'s very comfy! i also like the detailed description which helped me a lot on choosing the right one, and also recommended items they put out on their description. i don\\'t need to struggle seeking hours for matching tshirt. i bought this for workout but this could be good for a short walk too. overall nice pants! i did find the shirt ran small, but i love the fit of the pants. i liked it, it was just what i wanted, good quality and fair price.<br />i like to have songs in spanish and english excellent pants – very comfortable and flattering. it is true that they are very long, but that is no problem as they are easily cut to size and do not need to be hemmed. i think they may look a be it i like it read that i should buy right size or smaller... pants are long  .. i am 6 feet 1 and 373 pounds ...i use size 2x wish they made dress pants so i bought another pair!  really, for me they are my go to in an emergency pant.  and i like that they are palazzo pants.... unusual in the current environment of  &#34;all the same&#34; skinny leg pants, fabric is nice, feels good on...... well made, all seams match.  hem by cutting...beautiful vibrant colors. very comfortable and stretchy i like the quality even though it was a little too small it looks exactly the same but it was a little too big for a size small, but otherwise it was good wonderful almost what i was looking for.  nice for cooler nights.  i just wish they had pockets- that would be perfect! i gave a 5 star, because i do love them. but, my only complaint is that they are thin and can be seen through when bent over or stretched. i wouldn\\'t recommend for wearing in public. but, great for lounge pants or workin out at home. these look great on my 5 8\\'/185 frame.  very comfortable and wear/wash well.  can be dressed up or casual.  very nice pants. i love the material of these and even after a year or two i still wear them. they\\'re nice and resilient yet soft as well. the only drawbacks are they\\'re a bit small and have no pockets fit perfectly - true to size.  fabric was light and mostly wrinkle resistant.  purchased to wear backpacking in mountains and loved that they could be adjusted for the coolness and heat.  packed well.  washed and dried with ease.  highly recommend.  i purchased a second pair. these are so comfortable. buy one size bigger because they will shrink. i was a little worried that i would have to hem these, but the dryer fixed that issue perfectly. very please with the fabric and the fit.....  comfy palazzo pant are just that comfy...... love these pants...this is the second one i have purchased, first pair was camo and they are my absolute favorite casual pants. as stated in all the reviews, buy a size up and you will not be disappointed. i get compliments on them all the time. they are actually pretty sassy camo/cargo pants!!! great print, the look amazing and i got a lot of compliemtns, but they have already ripped at the crotch... thank god it is easy to fix. very happy with the capri well these are awesome! the only thing is they do run a little large. i got my usual size (3) and they fit like a 5. but i do kinda like the loose look so i\\'m going to keep them. overall great quality! these pants fit perfectly and are very flattering plus comfortable! the stylish waistband is very complimentary to the figure. fits great, material isn\\'t too thin and the color is good these pants fit great, not tight, great fit for me.  i don\\'t like my pants tight and these were lose, just enough. i wear a 2 and ordered the medium as per the suggestions from other\\'s. perfect! washed them and they didn\\'t shrink, look good. i recommend them especially when it gets colder, the material is pretty good. perfect pants to wear to a holiday dinner party. fit is true to size. price is too good to be true. the waist band is really tight which can cause a muffin top. so i just snipped a little here and there. otherwise the material and emojis are awesome. i love the suit the bra is just alittie to small not for 44d! soft medium-weight, very comfortable even on a very hot day, somewhat smoothing to the body.  i wear the top rolled up for a smooth look under a tunic top. fits well i love these pj pants and want to order more in additional colors.  they rock!  very comfortable and they wash great. love theses scrubs and great color. fit great! obsessed with these pants! sooo cute! would buy from seller again. a++++ pair number 5 love them only complaint is that they are too long for me and i am 5ft 3. otherwise i would have given them a 5 star rating like it love the pattern, but they are really long. fit true to size. the red color pants are wonderful. comfy and perfect fitting. great price and fast shipment. it\\'s a true red too, not off red like you seem to get with other products. overall great and would buy again. first one didn\\'t fit so gave to my roommate. ordered second one for myself. very chic and nice fitting. excellent price. comfortable and looks rich like the expensive ones. great item. very wearable with spring tunics. the pants are somewhat large on me but i love them regardless and am wearing them right now!  they\\'re so soft and comfy and wash without wrinkles or pilling.  :) love these. excellent fabric. great fit. super comfy!!! i received these as a birthday gift and they are probably the most comfortable yoga/lounge pants i have. i will agree that the fabric is thin, but it\\'s the same as some of the pants like these that you can find at walmart. i however disagree that they are see-through.  yes, the material clings so you\\'d be able to see certain panty lines and whatnot, but you can\\'t see through them. the legs are made wide and baggy and are somewhat long (i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; - but most pants are long on me regardless.) they aren\\'t troublesome to walk in especially since i just wear them around the house. i\\'ll definitely be buying more of these pants in different colors. i love these leggings. the boot cut is perfect, but above all, i love how the top supports me, and is even good for my lower back problem. they look great. at 5\\'8&#34; and 195lbs i expected these pants to be tight, but they are comfortably snug. after two wearings and washings (according to directions) they are in great shape. so far i can highly recommend these yoga pants. nice thick material, but the legging doesn\\'t feature much support, so make sure to down-size, if you\\'re looking for a more slimming fit.  the legging is also very long, so be prepared to roll it up, otherwise it will bunch up at the bottom. i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; at 117 lbs, and size \\'s\\' was too big for me.  xs would have been perfect! tried them on. perfection. immediately ordered a second pair. very comfortable beautiful print. would love to continue shopping with this brand also shipped unbelievably quick! :) i love these pants. they\\'re extremely comfortable and great for summer evenings because the fabric doesn\\'t cling. these are really comfortable, but i wish they came with elastic in the waist to help hold them up.  when i wear them to work i find i am constantly pulling them up throughout the day. excellent pants arrived very quickly...the sizing was great...very comfy...would love to purchase more like this in the near future..these pants rock! i love the relaxed fit . the roomy leg space flows with every step. very ethnic/ retro. love the style! very comfortable!!! they fit as expected, i just ordered a size that was too large! i loooove these pants. i wear them around the house all the time. i also wear them out and about when running errands since they are so comfortable. i can even use them for business casual at work with a white blouse and some heels. very versatile . nice 👍 :-) good quality very comfy i purchased these yoga pants and wished i had bought two.  they fit perfectly, and the design is really really unique.  they are flattering and provide full coverage in a downward dog..i love them! these are awesome, cute & sexy! i love them.. they only come in one size, which is very petite.. probably made for the lil chinese girls in china where it comes from.. lol .. im 5\\'3&#34; and about... 110-115lbs.. deff made for ppl of the very small size like me.. love them though! almost everybody men and women were giving me compliments on these. i got the grey and it looked exactly like the image. fit perfectly as well. just got these in the mail today & so far they\\'re not bad looking. i tried them on & they go just a little bit above my ankle. please take note that i\\'m 5\\'1\\\\\\\\\". the calf area is a bit looser than what i expected, but you get what you pay for. especially without trying them on in the first place. i gave it 4 stars because the pattern is pretty good & because it is hard for me to find pants at the right length. i\\'m hoping they\\'ll start to stretch out & elongate with a little wash & wear. worth it for the price & if you\\'re a short woman. we\\'ll see how long they hold up for. thinking about ordering the different shades, but maybe in a month or so when i see how happy i am with these. comfy, i love, these. its more of a cotton spandex, stretchy fabric. i knew these were free size but they are large, so it will fit a large range of sizes. the ties are unfinished, so i just tied knots on the ends. bought 2 x (i wear 18) should have gotten 1x but like this product (they are long) oh my goodness i love these pants!! these are seriously so soft! i had no idea that they would be, what a nice surprise. they fit amazingly and i would really like to order more, but i\\'m not that wild about some of the really crazy prints so we\\'ll see. it\\'s perfect for the price gf loves these love these pants.good quality,fit amazing,totally comfy and exactly what i have been looking for. great alternative to shorts,extremely lightweight. these pants are so cute and comfortable!  i wore them today and got compliments on them - the purple is dark and the design really pops.  i love them! bought an xl which is what i usually wear, but it was very tight. the pants fit well and i liked them a lot.  the length could have been a little longer for us long legged people. love love love these pants!! wore them once and got tons of compliments. will definitely be buying more. the koi lindsey pants are so comfortable! feel and look great! i love how they fit and love the velcro back pockets to keep my money and id in while at work without fear of losing them! i only buy this brand and style of scrub pants because i have never found any other that fit and feel as nice as the koi lindsey pants... i think they are worth every penny! these are super comfy and light. they are a good length for me, i\\'m 5\\'8. wonderfull fits perfect to ally friends fancy gorgeous i am a size 6 and these fit perfect in a small........the mediums get loose after wearing all day i received my shorts today! i ordered them on 6/5/2015, received 6/15/2015, expected delivery date 7/1-20/2015. i recieved them much faster than anticipated. i love these shorts......too cute! i bought an xl, and they fit perfect. i am a us size 8. i would purchase them over and over. i just wish the seller had more colors in this same size and style, so i could buy more! these pants fit true to size. i got the size i normally wear and they fit great. they are a little thin but not so thin that they are see through and that is fine with me since i plan on wearing them in the summer. good fit. nice material. beautiful color & style. soft material & they seem to be good quality. i ordered a medium & they are very long but the bottom of the pants have no hem (an unfinished bottom) so that you can cut them to the length that you need. i\\'m planning on wearing these to a wedding. may be a little too sheer to wear w/a short shirt. very high waisted (which i like). comfy pants, fit as expected. alittle long, but most things are since i\\'m only 4\\'10&#34;. good deal for the money. they are perfect perfect fit , only thing i dis liked was that there were strings on the outfit , other than that i love it !! i had no problems excellent service i ordered medium, but had to exchange for a large. love the pants tho. ordered 4 different colors! nice pair of darker bleu boot cut yoga pants. yay! favorite pj pants! very breezy pants and super comfy these harem pants were purchased for my daughter.  she loved them. i thought they ran a little big for her small stature but other than the extra fabric waistline, they were very nice! so comfortable and nicely designed. great fabric.... i will buy these again very comfortable and fit me perfectly, and i\\'m pretty short-5&#34;2&#34;  i will order more in the future when i need different colors. these are a perfect fit adorable goes with all my colorfull shirts, and there comfy, a good buy will be buying more! it fit very well and the material was amazing, better than many expensive linen pants. however, they sent me cocoa instead of taupe probably thinking i would not notice the difference. i am upset about this so i will be returning but the product is still great. definitely worth the money fit as expected, relaxed and comfortable i bought a large, which according to the size chart, is supposed to fit women who wear size 12-14 pants. they look really small in the package, but they stretch out and actually fit very well. oddly, they didn\\'t even leave a muffin top! they don\\'t stretch super thin either. they weren\\'t see-through at all. they also have a little hidden pocket inside the waist-line. i could fit my drivers license, bank card, and phone in there (my phone is pretty small though). overall, i\\'m very happy with these. my only complaint is that they are a bit loose behind the knee. it was a little tight but it did fit, but it didn\\'t last long in my closet because my daughter saw them and decided it was a prefect fit on her so she took them....lol when i get home from work, i immediately slip into these super comfortable pants. some reviewers have complained about them being too long, but all you have to do is pull them up higher on your waist. i am only 5\\'3 and they do hit the floor if i sit them on my waist, but that is not necessary due to the fold over flap. i look so skinny in these and my booty looks fantastic and nicely lifted! the flare on the bottom is so cute, and helps make your legs look long and skinny, (and i am a shorty). and they are perfect for yoga or fitness classes; your panty lines will not show. i am going to order another one. love these! these are super comfy. the fabric isn\\'t terribly thick, so you need to be careful what you wear under if people are going to see you, ha. thinking about getting another pair! thank you my daughter loves them. very good i love these pants!! let me explain, it is very hard finding fitted pants that are fitted at the top and not &quot;hot waters&quot; at the bottom. i am 5&quot;9 and slim. so i was happy to read the reviews that they were long. but here is the thing i bought 5 pairs of each different clothes and sizes. and they all fit differently. for example, when i bought the dark gray in medium they were really baggy at the top so i had to buy a small. however, when i bought the ones that were labeled just a simple &quot;gray&quot; had to buy that in a medium. the fit is very different for each color. even though they both could be a medium.....be mindful of this. i recommend buying two sizes of the same pair esp if you are tall because its very disappointing when u put them on and they are &quot;hot waters&quot;. but all in all love these. love my pants! very comfortable!! these were very well made and cute, as are all apt 9 clothing is.  but they were too small.  my fault.  they only had one size that went by waist and length.  i was off a couple sizes!  would highly recommend. little looser fitting than i expected but the fabric feels good. i had read another review and i ordered a size down from my normal.  with that in mind, the fit was as expected and i loved the length! really nice and great price.  super comfortable i ❤️❤️❤️ them very good omg this is so comfy and cheap! i bought one just to see how it fits and it\\'s just perfect...  also i live in california so i did not want something too thick... it feels very light on you. i\\'m gonna buy more ! ty! nice! they are capris, and a thinner material like summer pjs, but they are kind of long capris (and i\\'m 5\\'9\\\\\\\\\"). almost more like too-short pants. so they are a little warm in the summer, but not warm enough for winter. good for the in-between seasons.<br /><br />that said, they are very comfortable. i was worried that these pants weren\\'t going to fit because usually when i purchase plus size pants they are way too long. they are a little long but with the adjustable bungee cord at the cuff of each leg it keeps me from stepping on them. wife loves these pants, and they have held up well. these pants fit to size. love the pattern. what i didn\\'t like about these pants are the length.  they are very long, but other than that i love them! nice love these pants! they\\'re very comfortable and go up to my waist without squeezing my mid section at all. feel very comfortable jogging in them as well. will buy more soon! they are the most comfortable scrubs i\\'ve ever owned. i actually do wash an extra time each week just so i can have these specific pants clean! i knew i ordered the right size because i was able to try a different color on at a local store first, but they do run a little small (particularly in the butt area). i got one size up than what i typically wear. the white is a little more sheer than the average white scrub pants, but i wear light-colored nude underwear and it\\'s fine. the other colors have no problem with underwear coverage. i absolutely love them. nice their very comfortable [[videoid:6bba4f0b0566f12b1bbaa9771b655d42]]i am in love with these pants. they are so comfortable and so stylish. they literally go with anything. you can wear them out at night or to run errands during the day. they came in a nice tote bag and arrived on time. these are truly my go to pants now. i will definitely be buying many pair of these pants! they are also great for gifts with the holidays coming right around he corner. i received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. good quality but fit tighter than walmart\\'s sleep pants.  too long for my 5\\'4&#34; height. great fit and look nice got a lot of kudos estatic nice material elastic on back upper part of pants love, love these pants!  i now own 3 pairs......want to wear them everyday!!!  i wear size 10 in pants, & my hops/thighs are the biggest part of me.  the medium fits perfect!  of course, they are extremely long, but i just cut them as needed. the shirt is meant to be kind of a crop top shirt, which is what i was expecting. i\\'m very satisfied with it overall. the sweats fit great. the outfit all together is warm, stylish and comfy. i love the maroon like color. im 6 months pregnant and have very long legs! these are so comfy i dont ever want to take them off !!! i finally found pants that fit! i orderd two more. wish they were a bit softer on the inside though. beautiful fabric! these brand pants fit alittle tight, but because i always cover my rear end with wearing a long blouse it was fine. the linen is very nice and cool to throw on to make a run, go out on the town, etc. i they came in more colors then what they have although i also ordered them in the black. love love love! super cute! kind of &#34;grew&#34; on me as the day went on, i may get a small if i reorder. very nice leggings i love it 👍🏼👌🏼 i love this pants but it does somewhat small. shipping took over 2 weeks, so that part wasn\\'t great. these pants are cute, comfy, and the fabric is soft, however being made of 100% rayon and saying so in the description confused me when the tag inside the pants said 100% cotton. ?? i wouldn\\'t get too crazy in these pants, considering they are handmade and the seams could probably rip apart easily. also note they are quite see-through when you first look at them, but isn\\'t a problem because they are black and don\\'t appear to be see-thru once you have them on. i also recieved a coupon with each pair i bought for 15% off 2 more pairs or 20% off 3 or more pairs :) i take a medium and had to reorder and get an xl for them to fit in a normal way, but they\\'re pretty. the color is good.<br />tight enough to show thigh line they are expensive  but fit perfect and are so comfortable.  i bought four of them, long pants for winter, and have a couple short pants for summer. my favorite  brand ever! fit good and feel soft and comfortable. these pants are amazing! they are so strechy and cute! they are so comfortable i ordered two colors adn will be ordering many more!! i\\'m sure there are more expensive products out there, but these shorts are a good product for the cost. i had read other reviews that they ran small, so i ordered a larger size than usual and they worked great. the delivery and product were as promised. i would recommend. these are just what i was looking for. the only thing that could make them better is pockets. classy scrubs.  fit as expected. these are fantastic. just make sure to wash a few times before wearing. has an odd odor. otherwise they are perfect. i bought this for my 16 year old daughter and she has a small frame so it fit her perfectly. the material is very thin though she had to wear a pair of black biker shorts and black tank up under it though, other than that she likes it. just what i needed. i ordered these in a large, they fit pretty decent - length was ok, but i prefer a longer length (i\\'m 5\\'-10&#34;) so i returned them simply for that reason. if they were available in xl i think they would have fit great. the material was nice and soft just too snug on me. cute, perfect fit and very good quality. weird, funky smell to the fabric after washing and drying.  had to throw away.  bad product.  do not buy. the suit was perfect. love these these pants are groovy!!  totally love the feel and pattern and plan on buying more in different colors! girlfriend loves them my daughter loves it! excellent fit so very comfortable i usually wear a medium, i ordered a large and had to return. i re-ordered in xl and they fit like dickies mediums. good overall product, i like the cut. awesome! love it i have bought this item for my wife since she likes wearing casual clothes. she loved it. nice pants i need a size smaller seems to fit big a gift for my wife... or was it a gift for me? god bless the genius behind the behind of a woman in a yoga pant great fit, nice quality fabric. may run a bit long on some. i\\'m 5\\'6 and it\\'s a little long but i love that. love love these !!!! guess i won\\'t need butt implants after all lol! kid loved for dance class, fabric is soft, not too thick and not too thin, the color is vibrant, recommend sexy switch up!  they are easy to dress up or down.  ideal for casual fridays or just hanging out! i liked everything about this pants; fits really good, looks very nice and is really confortable. i will defínetely recommend it for exercise. great pants! once again their sizing is weird, it\\'s kind of a grab and go to weather or not it will actually fit.. i previously ordered the same type of pants, minus the pleather at the front in an 18, and they were comfy, but way too stretchy. but not in a falling off kinda way. they hold their shape quite well, but i can pull at the waist and get an extra 3, 4 inches. so, with that in mind, i ordered these in a 16. i should\\'ve taken the pleather into account because it isn\\'t stretchy. i can get them on, and button them, but let\\'s just say it\\'s not a flattering look. so, instead of 2 sizes down, it should only be one size down. but in not upset, just motivated to make them fit better. :) so, 4 stars for the pants, but 6 stars for the shipping! whoo! i ordered these on 12.11, the estimated arrival was 12.17 - 12.22, so imagine my surprise when they came today, 12.13! kudos for that! this fits well, breathes well (despite being polyester) and grips decently. there is a gusset/liner as these are meant to replace underwear. i sometimes till wear a thong underneath but it\\'s not necessary comfort-wise. i use these primarily as undershorts to prevent my thighs rubbing together under skirts and dresses but i occasionally even wear them as shorts and have been complimented on them. after a few hours they start to ride up but i suspect this is partly because i am smaller in the thigh than most with my waist size. the only down side is that they are a very light black, so upon receiving them they looked like they had been washed many times.. however they haven\\'t lightened any further since purchasing and i wash them frequently. overall these are my favourite and a great value for the price. this is a hard to find inseam for me and i couldn\\'t be happier. tight on the butt. but i have a booty. other than that perfect i love these yoga pants! i plan to order more in different colors. the fit is great and they are exactly as described and pictured and the sizing is perfect. the material is so wonderfully soft its a very loose fitting flowing pant. the waist is a little loose but the pants still stay up so that\\'s okay. the material is so thin and loose it almost feels like you\\'re not wearing any. i think i might have gotten a size smaller or even two. i did not think they were see through as some people have found with other colors - i got black and i feel i got exactly what i ordered. thank you for carrying large sizes. it is nice to have a wide range of color choices,too. thank you so much.  they were just what i ordered, arrived in time and fit perfectly. perfect color and size is awesome!!!  first time they\\'ve been long enough!!!! love the light cotton material... fits awesome with a simple white tank & a jean jacket... so comfy & perfect for the spring season... i\\'m 5\\'2, size 6 and these pants were long enough for me to wear wedges with them... very pretty, runs slightly small yet, manageable. great purchase price. :) the waistline may be a bit tight, but everything is great!<br />these pants are really worth it as well, super comfortable and all! the noble mount lounge pants purchased are warm and comfy.  fit great and will fill a gap in keeping warm in the winter. i love these pants.  there nice fitting on the body. they comfortable with a nice stretch. i love these pants.  i especially like the price.  they fit the way i expected and are good quality.  note that they do run long.  i\\'m 5\\'2 and the petite hit the bottom of my shoe.  i bought some in a different color in regulars, but i had to give them to my daughter who is 5\\'8. these pajama pants are very pretty. my height is 5\\'8&#34; and i just wish they were longer.  i have to wear these on my lower hips. oh well, right? :-d really good quality and true to size as one size fits all, kinda lose at the waist but there adorable i usually wear a small or xs. i am 5\\'5 . the pants fit just right, but the top is somewhat large. almost ordered a xs, but thank goodness i ordered a small. the pants would have been to small. i\\'ll be ordering again. daughter loves these jeans! the best leggings i\\'ve ever worn. great fit, comfy, and slimming! really cute and much more flattering than i expected.  got them to wear around the house but tried them on with strappy sandals with a high heel and liked them enough to wear them out.  am having a little trouble finding a top to look great with them but i\\'m not very good at that.  haven\\'t washed them yet. great! fabric somewhat sheer - depending on color. i ordered these pants to work out in because the old sweats were just too heavy/hot and not flattering.  these pants are now the most comfortable pants i own!  i love working out in them because they\\'re comfortable and cute.<br /><br />i am 5\\'7 and 140 pounds.  the size medium is perfect.<br /><br />edited:  i had to bump this down a star.  the stitching in the crotch of one of the pairs i bought came out, and i had a hole after one wear.  i sewed it and i\\'m still wearing them, but it\\'s kind of annoying that they fell apart so quickly. i am in love with these comfortable yoga wide-leg flare pants.  i have been wearing them two days in a row now.<br />i chose these pants in the color navy, and ordered a size small.  let me tell you, they fit exactly as i would expect ordering a size small.<br />the pants are a thin material, made of rayon with spandex, so they give you that nice fitted feel, yet comfortable and light-weight.  they have a fold down waist which is great pair with fitted tops and tank tops.<br />the legs fit nice and fitted in the thighs and upper legs and hips, but then cascade down to a flowy, flared leg.  i love the look of them.  they look adorable dressed up with some jewelry and gives a nice bohemian chic look.<br />the color is great, just as i pictured.  the pants are not see through which is nice, because with thin material i always worry about that, but did not have to worry here.<br />i literally love the feel and feel so comfortable in them!<br />**i received this product to review in exchange for my 100% honest opinion. these are the  best pants i have bought on  amazon yet. they are comfy and stylish for work, and they are light in this summer heat! it is a great pant but it is too long in the leg by about 10&#34; perfect omg these are the most comfortable pants ever! i\\'m actually buying another pair at a higher price, because they\\'re awesome. they run a little large i wear a 10 in jeans - usually a medium/large in everything else - and found these to be closer to an xl, but i\\'d imagine you can probably shrink them in the dryer. they may have factored that in when they made these. beware though: the material is quite thin and soft and the lace at the bottom is delicate, so wash on gentle cycle. i\\'d rather have them roomy and in one piece, so i wash them in a garment bag and hang dry.<br /><br />usually, i hate wearing extra clothes when i sleep, but i barely notice i have these on. i\\'m a huge fan of only hearts, and they\\'ve got another winner here. good construction and fit.this will be a little long for an individual confined to a wheelchair great quality! actually bought  them for teenage girls.  seems true to size, and very comfortable.washes well and doesn\\'t fade through many washings. thin material, may be see through in the sun, fit a little too big but awesome lounge pants! just what i needed to go with my swim top. i\\'d have given them five stars if they\\'d have had some sort of lining sewn in. i think that this is a really good deal for workout clothes. in the stores i would expect to pay $30 for an athletic top alone. comfortable and the fit is perfect. i plan to buy more. took me forever to find a pair of camo cargos. but i have to say these are great. the sizing is odd because it\\'s not standard, so ordering a 2xl was mortifying when i\\'m 5\\'8&#34; and between a 4 or a 6 with a 32&#34; inseam. these fit a bit large even after tossing in the dryer, but nothing a belt can\\'t fix. much to my pleasant surprise, the are perfect length! the pants are of a very soft material, which i love.<br />i am only 5\\'1\\'\\' and these pants came to my ankle, so if you are taller you may want to consider that these run shorter.<br />i am 105 lbs and did not have problem with the waist fitting. it is elastic.<br />the only thing i did was take the top of the belt off manually.<br />otherwise, i really love these pants and will be wearing them a lot! great pants and good fit. product arrived quickly these pants are the perfect summer compliment to a number of tops in my wardrobe. they are fresh, cool, easy to clean cotton, and have a relaxed fit.  i am a size 12 and the large fit perfectly. great fit and love the fabric. held up hiking in the mud and kayaking as well as the ocean. didn\\'t hold heat or feel heavy. i am so much in love with this pant that wanna buy another piece. i recommend this to everyone who want something fashionable but comfy. good i love them but the come in a small size i ordered the large and the fix was to thight.great for a person that wear a medium these pants are so comfortable for working out or just hanging out. just wish they had a pocket. i just received my pants. i love them. i was worried with the other reviews being so negative. i am 5\\'8&#34; 130 pounds. i ordered a size large. the fit was perfect. they went to the floor, so not to short. workmanship was fantastic. material is heavy and a rich color. i ordered black. would buy again in a heartbeat. took a week and a half to get here. ordered when they had free shipping. very pleased!!!! i would get a size bigger for my hips and butt but the waist would be to big. so i stuck with the one i got. these pant bring me so many compliments. love them so comfortable lots of compliments i couldn\\'t have asked for better for the deal i got :) as described.  shiny material is durable. great work pants, could also be worn as going out slacks with the right top. they are very comfortable and didn\\'t wrinkle in the dryer. a plus! great service & reasonable price. pants are perfect in material wearability for exercising. a bit longer than expected but this is a minor problem. these are snug and very shaping.  the white ones are transparent enough to show off the tattoos on my wife\\'s legs, but nothing else.  perfect for wearing around town. more colors please love this pants!!!! usually when i buy something online it doesn\\'t fit exactly; this one did. if i wear flats, i turn the waist up, but with my 1 inch shoes they were a good length. i wear this with colorful blouses left out or tucked in and i feel youthful. i am 76. the legging are cute but they run small. everybody wanted to know where i purchased them.  i warned them to buy a size larger than they actually need. the price is certainly right! these pants are much wider than i expected they would be on my petite frame. i truly only paid attention to &#34;yoga&#34; versus the word &#34;wide&#34; in the description. either way they take some getting used to but are still rather comfy. the deep black ink of the pants did not bleed into my white cotton top at all. i love that these pants snugly grasp at the waist. it is extremely flattering. these pants are more of a lounge pant for me than yoga. i really like them.<br /><br />*product sent for purpose of review it\\'s fine for the purpose for which it was bought. excellent product little small but suppose with the time will be big these pants are so figure lattering i love these i got a large i wera a 7 in jeans so order big i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these leggings. the colors are good and they look just like the picture, the fabric is pretty thick and they fit snug. they are a little long for me (i\\'m 5\\'3\\\\\\\\\"), but i love them. i wore them to a work out with richard simmons (yes, the richards simmons) and got so many compliments from everyone about them. they shipped faster than what they said (they\\'re coming from china). my only regret is not getting a matching top! i really like the how clear the print it, i think it looks quite nice and they\\'re comfy. i don\\'t mind the upside down crosses or that some of the cats looked ugly and creepy haha, i knew this before ordering it was too good of a deal to pass up. anyway i am rating only four stars because i upon putting them on i got two small runs towards the front, i\\'m familiar with this happening to leggings, but not usually this quickly. i used clear coat the stop the runs. overall i am pleased though. on our last cruise i saw a gal wearing this kind of pants in off-white linen.  they looked so &#34;cruisey&#34;.  gotta have some of those so i ordered the small ones.  when they arrived i tried them on and darn it, they were too small.  two choices:  order a larger size or lose a few pounds.  these inspirational britches helped me lose seven pounds and i now look properly skinny.  tahiti, here we come. i lovey them very comfortable i like the product. i ordered a size large because other tights i have worn fit me as a large. the size chart said i could wear a medium but a medium would not have fit. the product runs a little smaller than the size stated on the chart. so the large fits me just fine. the fabric is very soft and comfortable. i washed it by hand and drip dried as i do my other tights. it did not wrinkle and since it is a tight it conforms to your body anyway. it is good for any kind of workout. it did not give me any rash. but i washed it before wearing.  the only difference i see from the synthetic products is that it doesn\\'t tuck my tummy as well as the other tights. but, it is a good product and i recommend it. i was getting a rash from the synthetic tights but i found if i was them several times and rinse well i don\\'t break out. so for me either type is okay. as for shipping it arrived on time and in great condition. exceptionally good fit for me, since i\\'m large around the waist.  hang nicely.  great for work.  comfortable sitting or walking or bending over to file. i love leggings!  ever since the beginning of last year i have become obsessed with leggings or any other similar kind of pant.  this is why:  they fit great no matter how much weight i gain or lose, they look nice and very slimming, and feel lightweight and wonderful.  i can wear them anywhere, whether i am working out, going to a party, out to lunch, a concert, or anything!  these leggings certainly did not disappoint.  they fit great and looked great.  not sure how long they will last but for now, the condition they arrived in, they are perfect.  update- it\\'s been a little more than two years now and i still love these leggings.  after a year i got a hole on the inner upper thigh part of it but after a few months i got around to sewing it up and they fit better than ever.  i was around 170 pounds when i bought these, i am 150 now and they still fit perfect.  not loose at all.  i am 5.1 feet tall so it bunches a little at the bottom but i don\\'t mind, it doesn\\'t take away from the comfort of them at all.so lightweight and yet warm enough in cool weather (but i have thicker legs so, lol).  still great though. i love it but i have to keep pulling up the top to keep it from sagging. i love these pants, they are cute and comfy. lots of room . great fit and feel. super sexy. great gift for my wife who loves the gym! i love these pants. they are just like the photo and they fit wonderful!!! i am very happy that i bought them. i live in them because i love them so much. i look forward to coming home after work and putting them on. i like this company and so it did not surprise me that i would get a quality product. thank you to everyone involved in the process of this product. these are super comfy! great product at a great price. i love the quality these pants they run big so i have had to return them, but i immediately ordered another pair. very nice !! love get compliments all the time!! my favorite capris so, i have no idea what size i am anymore. i\\'ve put on weight in the past couple of years and i think that clothing manufacturers are mocking me. i have a pair of dickies cargo shorts that are a size 16 that i can no longer get one leg in...and a pair of size 20 old navy jeans that i don\\'t have to unzip or unbutton to put on or take off. ??? i ordered a shirt from allegra k here on amazon in an, &#34;xl&#34; and it looks like i\\'m wearing a boat cover...but a tunic from another shop in a large is cutting off the circulation to my arms as i sit here typing this! this is why i love this trend of these palazzo-type lightweight stretchy pants! this particular brand is not the palazzo style, more of a boot-cut...but they have plenty of room throughout the hips/thighs/legs, and do not taper at the bottom. the fabric is super thin, breathable stretch fabric (has a sheen to it-like spandex, but lighter). the best part however is...this fabric will fit a range of sizes within reason. i\\'m going to guess the xl will reasonably fit from a regular size 16/18 to a 20/22 just based on my own size...and i also have more of an apple shape. i hope this helps someone overcome their online ordering anxiety! these are very comfortable and fit well. i am 5\\'9&#34; and they are great in the length for me which is always hard to find in leggings for me. love the colors and the material good quality ! the pants are for my daughter ,she said they are very comfortable and the fit is perfect. these leggings fit somewhat large but my butt is pretty big so it was perfect. they do fade after about 10 washes so look out for that! just tried them on. i am 5\\'4&#34; and can wear them high waisted (under the bra) with a flowy over shirt to wear with flats or you can pull them down a bit and wear them with heels. very comfy and versatile! perfect! fit as expected these have become the best pants i have, so i got 2 pair.. i am only 5\\'1&#34; but was able to turn the waistband enough that they do not need hemmed.  i only washed them once but think they will fade pretty quickly. the pants fit as expected but are much higher on the waist than i expected for &#34;juniors&#34;. very pleased and purchased several more in different prints. reading all the reviews i got l i am a size 2 this is a big mistake i need a small i don\\'t know what the other reviews are talking abt. nice kind of baggy, but that was what i was looking for.<br />i like to wear these hiking, and when i hike in the winter they are big enough for me to be able to layer perfect fit!!! tommy bahama always fits good! i had to gave the pants for a performance. we were aware that they were sheer and prepared to wear tights underneath. i\\'m pretty short at 5\\'0 but incredibly curvy with a small waist (a blessing and a curse) so they had to be hemmed and the waist needed a drawstring (although i could have probably done without it). overall, it was a good solution and worked out well. this is my third pair of coolibar pants. they are the most comfortable casual pants i\\'ve ever worn. i own a black pair that traveled well during my trip to italy last year. i was able to wash them in the sink, hang them up to dry early in the day and wear them late the next day. the only drawback is that they don\\'t have a pocket. it fits perfectly super excited to find scrubs that fit in length. i bought a small tall and finally my ankles don\\'t show! love the color too. i love these pants!!!!  as a pe teacher i am always looking for clothes that are comfortable, appropriate, and stylish.  these fit all three criteria.  they are thin with a smooth cotton feel.  i love colors.  these are a great pair of pants for anyone. great looking pants!!! fit well :)) good comfy. these are cute but larger than the blue ones i have. they are more like a size 14. great house palazzo pant.  however, when i looked at it in the light, one panel was darker black than the other! this prevents me from wearing it outside the house. lol very comfy love these, will probably get more soon love the pants just a little bit too short. i\\'m 5\\'5 and they are about an inch too short, i hope they don\\'t shrink too much after i wash them. other then them being too short they are super comfy and the color is good too so if your shorter the 5\\'5 they\\'d be perfect. very small, so she ordered the next size up, otherwise perfect, dosnt cover very much, which is why she ordered them...fabric fine quality fine..expect a lot of attention i miss my warm comfy pants when they are in the wash!  find myself wearing them every day!  i love the soft flannel lining.  they are not high fashion, and i would not wear them to a \\\\\\\\\"casual dressy\\\\\\\\\" occasion, but as i said for every other day they are marvelous! thicker, stronger cloth than expected. i wear them all the time! i love them! super cute & comfy! very nice and comfortable pants! love the patter, excellent color and fabric. the only thing, is that they are a tad bit long these will be great for my wife\\'s harley quinn cosplay next month! we are pleased with this purchase. love these pants. i am tall  and they fit perfectly! sleek, simple and cool and you can add different heels, jewelries for more stylish look! i love my leggings unfortunately they ran a little too small but the company was very cooperative and friendly and i got my bigger size and im happy again!!! receive the product in perfect condition and are very satisfied with the purchase thanks it\\'s a good fit in clothing as far in leather,genuine leather clothing is very good fit in clothing. but only in small to medium sized fit as far in leather clothing fit. i love this jumpsuit! it\\'s comfortable, fits perfectly and i get compliments when i use it. i definitely recommend it, looks really classy and the material doesn\\'t look cheap. great quality price. i especially like the drawstring cuffs at the bottom i love these and for the price. i have a small waist and big behind so they fit good in the behind but big in the waist i will order the large and pass these onto a friend! great comfortable pants. material is thin, but good for the price and excellent for the summer! i got the large for my last trimester, but i am usually a medium. fits well. my mother loves these slacks. these pants are great, well made and comfy and i\\'m keeping them even though they are a little tight right now. many other people who purchased these yoga pants commented on the size being smaller than it should be, i didn\\'t pay enough attention to that and made the purchase anyway. i should have gotten a large. got these for my son.   he loves them.   they are so comfortable.  i got them for my other son last year and he was crazy about them.  they wash up great. pencil slim legs that makes sizing for customer tough. the color was exactly spot on... quality first class--hated to return nice love the snowflakes, fits perfectly. also great for sleepwear. may order another set, i like it so well. fits well and is well made. i\\'m so glad i bought these.. comfy and cute.. perfect for our upcoming cruise the style is ok, but too long for me. they don\\'t look as femme as they do in the pic, so i gave them to my nephew. cute pants thin fun print. swastka&#34; like&#34; emblem on them. i am jewish so it freaked me out.husband said it means something else. really comfy but my wife is 5\\'9&#34; and it not quite long enough. we\\'ll most likely take out the hem. love them they are comfy and cute but alot of waist band fit great and expedited delivery great fit! perfect fit. light weight. love these. i am happy. these are super long. i have to wear some fairly tall heels with them. (i\\'m 5\\'4&#34;) fits well, looks good, comfortable and functional. this playsuit is so comfortable! the zipper on the side makes it so easy to get one and really make the figure flattering. very comfortable material! be careful how you wash it! these are cool jeans, but my granddaughter informed me she only wears skinny jeans love it little short but its ok i am a man with very sensitive skin, so most pants bother my legs.  these lounging pants are so comfortable that i\\'ve barely taken them off since i bought them.  also, the company claims to be socially responsible, using no sweat shop labor, etc.  more details here: [...]<br />it would be nice if amazon included the above info. on its website.  i only wish this company was using organic cotton... i love, love, love the women\\'s sports yoga workout fitness training capri pants with the yellow stripe down the side of the leg because they are unbelievably comfortable.  you all know me by now that these are perfect for my line dance class.  i love the style and color! purchased these and they are just what i wanted.  they do look of real jeans and very soft.<br /><br />you must keep in mind these will shrink if you put them in the dryer.  i wash in cold water and hang dry, before and after dry i step on the bottom of the legs and stretch them.  this way they keep the original length. these are such great leggings.  i wore them to a zombie walk and got several compliments.  the waistband could be a little snugger (i\\'m 5\\'8&#34; and usually wear a medium/large).  unfortunately, the leggings ran after about 10 minutes of wear. great pants! much better quality then expected.  fits perfect. thanks so much 😃 super soft and comfy, good value for the price. these are very comfortable pants. i ordered the size 14 and they still have room - they have a great fit for me. i would definitely recommend them. i have very long legs and was hoping it would be a bit longer but it fit me as i expected it too.  can wear it casual or very dressed up. what can i say comfy and silky good buy for my fourth of july party, i would buy more of these these are really a fashionable pair of leggings. they even give [[asin:b00a7p8nmu lysse leggings for women-ponte knit seam detail wide leg legging (style#1410)]] a run for their money. they fit great and look amazing. what more could you ask for? the material was a little on the thin side, but not thin enough to see through. i loved the fit and how the waist when a little high. these are very comfortable and stylish, but are really long in length. not very heavy material so not hot to wear. i love these. so comfortable and look great. i always get compliments. i want more.  wish they had more colors. love fits great!  it\\'s a polyester blend though so it\\'s a little hot.  maybe good for cold hospital. i am 5 11 very tall and a thicker girl. the leggings are perfect. they strech well and he material is so soft. they do not show thru but onthe side of my hip you could see my underwear. but who cares! cant see my butt im not worried! perfect fit for 6\\'0 35&#34; inseam women - i am a size 12 sometimes 14 and the large was perfect i have a bunch of these and love them all, they\\'re great to sleep in, wake up and go to the store in, hospital jammies, cruise clothes.  these pack the best! you can\\'t go wrong with these! very good service, but too expensive.  purchased 3 pairs of pj pants in alaska for my granddaughters but one pair was too small. hence i ordered another (larger) pair from hatley at almost twice the price as i paid in ak to complete the gift for my granddaughters.  i would anticipate that items cost more in ak (tourists, remoteness, etc.)but i paid $24.95 in ak and $39.95 from hatley.  big difference!  couldn\\'t get back to ak to return so i had to go with hatley.  that\\'s called convenience.  cn the pants are very comfortable to wear, and the fit great. the price was great and delivery was fast. i love this outfit very cute i love  this outfit! my only complaint  is that they don\\'t  make it in more colors. i heard it ran a little off size wise. i got a large and it was a little  big. first wash it shrunk just a bit making  it perfect! i\\'m  5\\'2&#34; #138 and it hits mid thigh. just the right fit and length... not bad !! made in america!! doesn\\'t shorten when washed! feels so great on skin!<br />i love these pants! absolutely bought/buying more! exactly what i was looking for. bright red, good fit, and not cheap material with a good price tag. the waist is a perfect fit, but the bottom is way too long. i have to spend a little more to have the pants taking-up. overall, love the cute color and the minor set back won\\'t stop me from purchasing more colors/pants. love these. and so does my husband ;). they\\'re a little see through, which was the point! they do run a little larger, but not much.  i am a 12 and a m fit great.  they make that section sweat a lot more.  i can tell i am losing too.  highly recommend. in the morning and at night i find that my legs tend to get cold.  when i get out of bed in the am, i pull on the lounge pants.  that way, i keep my legs warm while i move around the kitchen getting the day started.  in the evening i find that they are great for just sitting around the house. they are warm and cosy. wash well and wear well.  i have several pairs. nice pants thank you! good the material is really thin and if i was any taller they probably wouldnt fit me right, as in they would be too short (im about 5\\'6), but overall theyre very comfy and the design is really nice. you will like them if you like the style of pants.<br />~be careful with washing them because the design on them could very easily come off in a regular machine wash so i suggest either hand washing them or washing them on delicate pretty awesome pants, very comfortable and are not see-through. i am so excited that i didn\\'t cancel my order. after reading the comments about the pants being too tight or too big i was really worried they would not fit me. however, they fit great and are so comfy!!! i did get a size larger because i was worried about them being too small and man they are comfortable! very happy with these scrub pants. they fit well and are very flattering. but are a little tight on my thighs but fits perfect everywhere else  my thigh is 23 inches and i ordered a small my hips are 38 inches and they fits well there<br />they are still usable but take caution if you have pets as they attract the hair alot great! love them! good deal i love the pants but unfortunately they do not fit.  they are too snug now but i suspect that they will fit ok by summer as there is normally a 10 lb. difference in my winter weight & summer weight. i like it! i\\'m on the lookout for cotton poplin or broadcloth pajamas and there are not many out there to be found.  cotton poplin is soft, insulating and breathable and unlike flannel, does not pill.  after a wash the material looses its stiffness and with further washings becomes even softer.  my only recommendation would be to manufacture more of this sort with various colors and design. the waistline was a little tight for them to be listed as &#34;one size&#34;<br />other than that, i really liked them. i received several compliments :) same as the other pair i purchased, the ride up and hug where you don\\'t want them to. but they are so cute and look great! they run long, but a cute pair of wedges does the trick. these are great.  they have all the style of a good rock n\\'roll pant with all the comfort of leggings.  i wore them out to a club and everybody wanted to know where i got them...and at the end of the night while all my friends were finding ways to get relief from their uncomfortable clothing i was really happy i was wearing these. i love it! these are too cool! i bought these for my mother for her birthday. now i may order myself a pair. so well made. i can dress up with these or dress casually. they just look and feel great. these pants came up to my waist, fit comfortably and have pockets. and an added extra is that i do not think that i will have to hem them.<br />will have no problem ordering them again. purchased the tshirt and 2 pair of lounge pants for presents this year.  they are fabulous, soft and well made - just like the cotton items i purchased while in cairo!  great stuff. love them, they are super comfy and fit just right \\x1a\\x1a a lot of &#34;yoga pants&#34; have too little or too much elastic. nothing is worse than finding that your yoga pants look like a deflated walrus skin from behind after wearing them for half of a day. these pants keep their shape, and also don\\'t look like flimsy, glorified leggings. great choice. the color was a little darker than pictured, which was actually good for me because i was debating whether to order it in this color because it\\'s a little lighter than i normally like to wear.  i like darker colors because it hides small flaws or stains better.  it looks more like a brown mocha coffee color.  wrinkles a lot with washing.  i\\'m lazy when it comes to ironing.  i wish more clothes would be wrinkle free. it didn\\'t shrink that much for me, which is good.  fabric does make some rustling noise. i think.  my memory can be a little fuzzy at times. a little too long for my legs, and i\\'m 5\\'5&#34;, so will have to have them shortened a bit.  very soft fabric. will order more, quite comfy. it\\'s ok alfred dunner always fits as expected. very good basic pant to wear with a variety of pretty tops. this item fit well, was what i expected, material and length was perfert, drawstring look really nice,will purhase another, shipping was good i love these pants. i wish the seller made many more!!! i\\'d purchase them all! it is so difficult for me to find pants that fit well. thank you!!! they are definitely junior fit. i purchased a medium even though i usually wear a small. the material is nice and soft. if you wear a med. in pj\\'s and so on you\\'ll be a med. in these pants too.<br />pros:<br />price<br />soft<br />stretchy<br />not too thin<br />perfect length (i\\'m 5\\'6\\'\\')<br />cons:<br />wont last forever i\\'m in love with reducci pants!  i\\'ve bought several in different styles.  i went up 1 size just because i\\'m not a spring chicken and they just seem to hang better at least the lighter colored ones.  the dark ones i bought are a my size and a bit tight but look good first i hate to write a review but the jumpsuit is really nice on me i received so many complements of this.. good material fits good.. i like these because they are thick and fit and feel great on.  however, as other reviews say-and i must agree, they are very long.  i am tall (5\\'8) and these still come down over my feet. i loved the palazzo pants, but they are a little too thin for my liking. i would still purchase again. very comfortable my girl friend got these as a gift, and loves them! i hope they hold up, because she loves wearing them! great , sturdy cotton. still when you get them but just wash gentle and use some liquid softner. hang dry. i recommend getting a larger size for a roomy , pajama feel. love the fabric and the look very comfy.. they are a bit too big but they\\'re comfortable nonetheless and the material is very flimsy.... take in mind they are big on me... i did a squat and the seem in the back stretched -___- talk about embarrssing and i don\\'t really have a butt. so for my big booty girls, watch out for this! i love these pants.  the color is perfect.  i appreciate the extra support for my belly, and as an added perk, it gives my lower back a bit of support, as well.  no muffin top.  recommend. i am 5\\'8&#34;, and wear between an 8-10, ordered 2 pair in a medium and they fit perfectly.  i purchased these to wear after having a hysterectomy since i knew my tummy would be tender.  they worked perfectly - i wore them pretty much every day during my recovery, and out of all my yoga pants these are my favorite because they are so soft and comfortable! nice, but you should go a size up. its perfect. i love it! thanks i believe ordering one size smaller would be best for me. this is important! these pants come really small. i took the advice and ordered m plus which was tagged large. i m a size 4 and the l pants were really snug on me. i had to put some effort in getting the clasp closed. but once i put them on they were comfortable and looked great on me, compared to other snow pants. they are tighter on the legs which looks nicer than baggy snow pants but at the same time it kept my legs very warm from wind and snow on my ski trip. i recommend them but order 2 sizes larger! modernmiss emailed me to double-check on my waist size to make sure these would fit great -- and they do! i\\'m 100% satisfied with them, they fit/look just like the picture. i am 5\\' 3&#34; and 128 lbs. excellent love these pants. they are comfortable and stylish like jeans without the heavy bulk feel of jeans. this was a gift for my sister.  she says the fit great and are wonderfully comfortable! look and feel great. the pants are cute, but for the dark pink at least, they\\'re not the same color as the picture! they\\'re more like legally blonde pink. which is still cute, just annoying that it\\'s not the color i wanted... gave them to my granddaughters for christmas gift, they seem to love them. ill start by saying that this company is so agreeable. the first pair of pants i received had a rip in them and when i contacted the company they send me a new pair as soon as possible that i just love. i just wish they had a larger size because even though im very small the pants are quite see through if i were to bend over in public. beautiful and vibrant colors. fast shipping. i\\'m 4\\'11 110lbs. little bit long but it still looks awesome i\\'m a size 0/1 and about 5\\'1\\' in height but these fit me excellently! they aren\\'t too tight but not to loose either. definitely fits my style. i received these in 4 days so the fast shipping was a plus. i\\'ll be dealing with this company again with out a doubt. nice fit and fabric...will be perfect to wear with hot weather with the thin fabric...i prefer to fold the waist down because it hits under my ribs otherwise. perfect for tall ladies. i\\'m 5\\'9 and this hits the floor. can\\'t wait t wear it out this weekend! they fit my 13 year old wonderfully! welcome back 90\\'s fashion, lol. i love these.....there very different.  love shopping online cause ive never seen these in a store. very odd but i love them. very comfortable. luv them satisfied love the pants, a little tight but that\\'s ok. very happy with this shippers product, have ordered 12 pairs in the last month and have received all orders within 2 weeks of order being placed. really like the color and fits really good. it is a little too big, that\\'s why i bought it big, and i am very happy with it. after this past new england winter, i am so glad to have it for next year. incredibly comfortable lovely soft fabric, flows beautifully,nice chocolate color. the waist sits very high. love the fit and design of these pants. they\\'re very comfortable as well. would purchase in many colors if they were available. love them. they are very cool looking. just what i wanted these pants are very comfortable but they were much longer than i expected, and they have really stretched out after use. for future reference, go for the smaller size. these are my favorite workout pants, and i own many!  they are comfortable, stretchy, very flattering, not tight in the waist but they stay put.  i have them in the crop and the long pant.  they are thick enough that they can\\'t be seen through, but not so heavy that i get hot.  great! great material, stitched excellently, fits like a dream. goes really well with short and long kurtas. i have machine washed it and the material is as soft as ever. definitely worth the $$ i really like it and several others on this site but seems that most of them are xs or small like really? some ppl do meat on their bones. i guess if i have meat on my bones i cant look cute lol. can i gt a med or large lol love the fit i really love this product, and the pants fit perfectly without any problems. :) material is slightly transparent at first i was skeptical about the one size fits all but it fits pretty good, very stretchable. if you\\'re obese it probably wont fit but chunky fits fine. material is very light and breathable, made of rayon. the only downside to it is it needs to be hand washed but besides that i love it. color is vibrant and feels soft and breezy. fits great and at an even greater price. i was on the verge of buying the name brand at $88 a piece. then i saw these at target and was so pleasantly surprised at the quality and fit. instead of paying almost $200, i spent about $40! i\\'m in love with these pants. i have several pair and i wear them to the gym daily. i love that they stay up no matter what i\\'m doing, but the general consensus is that they make my derriere look h.o.t.t. true story. i took a poll. they\\'re comfy, easy to wash and wear, and make me feel like dancin\\'!! looks very nice great transaction. these pants are very silky, but a little smaller than i like. the colors are bold and they are well made. i wear large...so i stuck with the same size and i was not disappointed. this product fit just as expected.with my after birth tummy, i was happy to find something with an adjustable waits to adjust to my big tummy where it overtime it is clean it\\'s so cute!!!!!!!!!..... i really recommend this vendor,at  first i was scared because of the size of the sheepshort but the are ok no to long how i prefer but i have a big butt that\\'s the problem besides that the hoodie is so lovely  i can\\'t wait to wear it. great quality and i love the color. .. i bought these for running in cooler weather, i find myself wearing them as an all around comfort pants around the home. maybe i have a thing for spandex since losing weight(225 lbs). they fit well and i like the way they look. i bought xl size i\\'m about 6\\'1&#34; tall and 195 lbs. no pockets or any inside pockets. i\\'m looking to find other colors. any questions just ask. i´m 5`3 and i like these because they´re not too long. i ordered them in x-small and they fit me well. love the fabric and the quality, i´m happy! quality isn\\'t so great, but i don\\'t expect it to be, you get what you pay for. doesn\\'t look cheap, but feels cheap.  look exactly like on picture,super cute, which is great, that\\'s all i hope for.  i get usually 28 inch jeans, i have thick legs, medium is a little small. i can\\'t believe these fit! i\\'m 5\\'9&#34;, pear shaped body about 194 lbs and these not only fit like a glove, but still had a tiny bit of room so that they weren\\'t skin tight. cannot wait to wear!! fits!<br />feels great<br />i wish i could wear them all the time love it love these pants, they fit really nice perfect will be buying more!! shipping took a while but worth the wait. i love these cords. the color is subtle and dark. they go with the earth tones very well. i wear them with a boot heel shoe and they are very slimming for cords. these pants are everything the reviewers say about them except for the thickness. they aren\\'t as thick in my opinion as the other reviewers say. these look cute on and are very flattering to my figure. i wear a size 11 - 13 and i ordered size large and they fit as expected. i haven\\'t worn them beyond trying them on so i suspect they will stretch after wearing them for a while. i am shaped like kim kardashian and these fit very snug. if you are looking for a looser fit, order a size up (if possible), otherwise these may be too tight for you. if i had to pick something negative about the pant i would say that the pockets on the behind look like they\\'re really close to each other, closer than all my other jeans or workout pants still, i give these a five because they are very cute and a fantastic value. i would buy these again and recommend them to others. fits perfectly! very comfy. nice weight.<br />just what i\\'d expect from organic cotton. a gift for someone ... haven\\'t heard any complaints! i love it great leggings, and very affordable, deffenently turning heads while wearing them , the seller has great things also very affordable and never worry someone else will wear the same stuff as you :) i love them.  they are so comfortable. i thought i was this size, but im not, i ordered wrong size on my part. love the pants daughter loved them! very comfortable and can be used to dress up or dress down depending what top you wear. good for the price these pants were a good deal.  they are long but can be cut to fit without a lot of fuss.  probably won\\'t last for ever, but like pay-less  shoes, they are perfect for occasional dressing up!! i love this fabric and love that i\\'m able to get separates so i can mix and match. i\\'m probably going to give these to someone who i know will enjoy therm. if you order a size one smaller than you wear, you will be satisfied. i like the fabric, medium thickness, not to cool or to warm. i buy from woman within often and i have no negative things to say. ordered another! i ordered 2 pairs of these yoga pants. size large. they fit great! very comfortable.... i\\'ve just ordered 2 more! durable excellent very 5\\'5 with small frame and they fit perfectly. color was darker red than appears in photo, which was better than expected (perfectly matched my nail color!). very soft and comfortable. i love the feel, and the comfort. i had been looking for a replacement for a pair of my favorite pants, this is so close, it\\'s scary! i will definitely buy again, hopefully they\\'ll get the white in xl in. nice, comfortable! had to choose fit as expected when these were purchased as a gift. they look beautiful and i hope they fit. pack this lightweight tribal print palazzo pants on your next trip. unpack and wear it for any occasion. a jacket and shirt for meetings, dress up with something sheer, shiny or lacy for evening or just lounge in t-shirt. the most versatile item in your suitcase. and that was the main worry. i knew that if i could squeeze my hips past the legs that they would look great. the size was hard to determine, but it\\'s right there in the description. it\\'s cute no matter what. will probably just change the elastic on the waist myself. good price, though. they were great to wear for christmas (tacky sweater party) however, there were 2 holes in the crotch after wearing them only an hour. i love these pants! they are very slimming and flattering. a great buy for the price & would definitely recommend! daughter loves the shorts! nicely made and good fit without being skin tight. delivery was fast and efficient. the tights were as expected but were a little small. i gave them to my daughter. they were a perfect fit and looked great on her for me it is great, but i´m not big... love these pants. just as the other reviewers! fit is perfect. i am 5\\'6&#34; and about 138-140 lbs and these fit perfect. they shrink a tad after washing and drying. back to buy more. #addicted i\\'ve searched for brown yoga pants for a long time and finally found them. i love the quality of these pants. they\\'re a little long but a quick hem will take care of that. great! got these for my daughter, no runs and she\\'s had them since june for intensive dance and she still wears them for her 4-5 day practices love the color! fit well although material is fairly thin! i love these pants...they are plenty long enough and the material is so soft...they are really comfortable. i wish there were other colors and i would order some more!!! nice great for the price! i love these. i wasn\\'t sure how the height would be since my legs are pretty long [5\\'11], but they\\'re great! i basically want to wear them all the time. got this for my preteen step-daughter and they fit her perfect.<br /><br />she is a size 0 and we got her a medium.<br /><br />i think it is made for smaller body types.  the quality is good, not that thin material that snags easily. this fabric is wonderful.  it\\'s soft, smooth, washes and dries well.  the cargo pocket is perfect for toting supplies, and the two front pockets are oversized, so they hold plenty, too.  i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; and 112 pounds, and these fit perfectly! i\\'ve written an earlier review for these, but i just can\\'t say enough about them. if you like something different, particularly with a bohemian feel, you will love these pants. the colors are even prettier than pictured. the material is so soft you won\\'t believe it. i live in las vegas, and these are comfortable even in our extreme summer heat. another big plus is that you can put them in the dryer on low heat for about 10 minutes, and the wrinkles just disappear. they would be perfect for travel. i get many, many compliments when i wear them, and i always tell people i got them on amazon. do buy these pants. they are fantastic. these are great lounge pants. perfect for when you just want to throw on something comfortable to hang around the house. they are super soft to sleep in too. i am 5\\'3 and about 145 lbs & these fit like a glove!  super cute for the office and even going out in.  my thighs and butt are much larger then my top half so i always have trouble finding a small waist but larger leg and butt area.... well these are just that!!!  i still can\\'t believe how perfect they are.... love, love, love these and the price is great.  will be ordering more.  oh and looks great with a pump! theses were a little bit larger than i expected.  i must be right between a small and a medium.  i am 5\\'4\\\\\\\\\" and 125-128 lbs. the length was perfect for me because although 5\\'4\\\\\\\\\", i am long waisted with short legs.  i love the fabric, however.  i have other scrubs of this fabric and love the no iron feature.  the touch of spandex makes them even more comfortable.  i wish jockey had more of these to offer, especially more tops.  jockey tops are my favorite because of the multiple pockets.  i need to separate small objects in my pocket as a respiratory therapist.  i will keep buying jockey! i knew this was clothing for larger women. i am a 14 and have many scars that i cannot put pressure on in clothing. so, i have washed these several times and even tho they stretch some during the day, i am comfortable.i think they are a good quality and for me work to wear to yoga or errands and i am comfortable. well made, nice material, comfortable.<br /> these are exactly as described and a very good buy.<br />an authentic product! this is my second pair of lysse capris and the fit is consistent. they wash and dry nicely. i like the feeling of light compression. the fabric has some heft to it and is an ideal weight for south florida fall wear. beautiful pants too long for me but gorgeous<br />thanks for quick shipping great buy. good quality. these pants are great to move in. the small size stretches comfortably to fit over my big butt. ;-) i\\'ll probably buy these again after i wear them out over the winter! fits perfectly. got a size small and i have the same inseam as these pants and it fits like a glove. love them. charcoal gray. the only complaint is that the stitching was weird in one place, other than that they are perfect love these pants a little small but still fit i love them don\\'t go up a size shipped quickly very soft and comfy to lounge or go out i love them! perfect for spring/ summer very bohemian and good quality love it!<br />fits just right!<br />love the color and very comfy!<br />thank you! i love the pants. they fit perfectly. i wear them to work or when i\\'m out and about. great buy. i ordered small and it fits perfectly from the waist. it is just too long for me (i am 5\\' 2&#34;). i like the color and the fabric. fits fine, feels good and are worth the price they look the way they look in the picture. great quality at great price these are exactly what i thought they was made of. i ordered a size bigger. they fit well. they are like a t-shirt pants. i love them. nice fit. i wear it a lot, and still looks like new, i love but i brought a size more than my us size because asian size usually are smaller. these are terrific slacks.  the fit is good, the look is stylish and the color is a good walnut-like shade of brown. . .just what i wanted.  wish they came in a true navy. warm, very long (i\\'m 5\\'4&#34; had to hem), and good quality for the price. cargo pockets make them feel a little bulky, but they are comfortable and practical. my daughter loves these. i\\'m thinking about getting a pair for myself. love it very cute pants. they don\\'t fit. i should have brought a larger size.they are too cute to send back. i\\'ll lose a couple of pounds and try again.  i should be in them by or before next summer. hard to find pants in consignment stores.  here is a great selection, size chart is off, 2 sizes smaller than chart fit perfect (exchange went very smooth), and it has pockets!  anxious to buy more colors soon! excellent service from seller, great product. pants actually have real back pockets (yay). kind of stretchy so if you need to move around you don\\'t get wrinkles. color lasts indefinitely, i have had one pair almost a year, and they are still bright. these devigi capris are comfortable, give good support, and the double waistband is a marvelous invention--they do not ever ride down. they make me look and feel great. highly recommended. i ordered large and the size fit perfectly. i was somewhat skeptical, but these fit beautifully, not too tight, not too loose, just right.  quality seems to be very good.  i do plan to order some more if they have other colors. this is my second pair and i love them.  i had to replace my first pair due to the fact the black was fading.  they also now have a small hole in the leg and that is the only reason i gave them four stars instead of five.  for the price they shouldn\\'t do that. i love it! very comfortable and fits well. it is a bit long but that is fine.  also its a bit see thru, so don\\'t wear it with a short blouse.  other than that its a very nice, comfy and well fitting legging its perfect, the material is very fine it\\'s a great product these pants are so comfortable.  they arrived on time and i am very happy with the quality. as expected, they are about 4 inches too long, (i am 5\\'2\\\\\\\\\") but they may be cut to fit without hemming, which is a huge plus. i would definitely recommend these, and the price was great. wow..i ordered the black medallion and these are very beautiful and silky. it has a subtle shine to them . in spite of the fabric being so thin, it\\'s not see through. i usually wear size 6 and the medium was really form fitting around the top area and hugged my rump. i wore it in the house, but i can see people staring at my goods if i went out with this lol. it really accents the curves to be provocative!  i don\\'t care to seek that kind of attention, i just want to feel comfy, so i\\'ll be wearing this with a nice top to cover this area.  i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; and these pants covered my feet + 2 inches of fabric. i\\'ll have to wear some high heel sandals to show off the full pattern.  dress it up or down, you\\'ll look amazing in these. =) these are great! i like the style, the print is nice and the pant is well made, specially for the fabric. caution, read revised section - i am so pleased with this purchase. great fit!  the fabric is wonderful and the fit is amazing. i normally order a 2x and went with a 1x based on other reviews. the pants are still roomy and i wonder if i should have gone a size smaller still.  pants are cut beautifully in my opinion and the opinion of my 26 year old daughter. i will be ordering another pair of these, with a colored stripe next time.<br /><br />revised---------<br />i am not happy with this seller since i had the items delivered to my work and now i am receiving plus size catalogs at my work now. if you buy from this seller you will be put on mailing lists! not good woman within...not good at all these were perfect and as expected!  my daughter loves these. i like the feel of the jeggings and would buy another pair, however, they were big in the waist. i gave them 5 stars but decided to take just 1 star back because of the lint balls that form after a few washings.  i absolutely love the flattering fit, the feel, and the way i can wear these pants with just about anything.  i pair them with a tank and cardigan for work-our attire is buiness casual.  on weekends they\\'re easy to pull on for errands or whatever!  the black holds up well after several washings, but they do start to get natty, picking up lint from my cardigans and developing they\\'re own little lint balls.  since i wear them so much, i\\'ve bought several pairs of these in black in an effort to minimize wear.  i had previously ordered directly from woman within.  i was elated to see them on amazon because i get free 2-day shipping (amazon prime membership).  can\\'t beat it! good excellent. meet the expected i really like the colors / pattern. i wear a size small in every pair of scrubs i own - grey\\'s anatomy, icu by barco, cherokee, dickies. i ordered these online because i thought they looked cute and comfy but they were tight around the waistband. i really love the style though, i will be returning and purchasing a medium. love these so much, nice and snug on the waist. only problem is i\\'m 5\\'1 and thought i\\'d fit into a petite size... nope they are too short... other than them being high waters i love them! def ordering a small next time instead of petite. this item is very comfortable and makes riding my bike more comfortable. would recommend this product to anyone and would purchase again. these are the perfect lounging around the house while your man is at work and you are doing laundry, and cleaning, and chasing after babies while watching soap operas pants.  i wear a size 2 jeans, and i am five foot seven but i ordered large because i like my lounging pants to be loose....these were perfect...if i had ordered a medium or a small like i wear in everything else they would have \\\\\\\\\"fit\\\\\\\\\" and been too tight.  make your own call in regards to your preference...they have a drawstring so if they are loose you can tie them! i got a lot of compliments, and they are so comfortable. i like them but, there a bit see thru and the back of the leggings are transparent but over all i like them comfortable, but dressy. fit a bit small i\\'d been searching for months for a replacement pair of capri leggings that were similar to a pair i\\'d gotten years ago - that i loved - that had finally fallen apart. i found these and they are perfect! i was skeptical at first because &#34;one size fits all&#34; is never true for plus sizers. granted, these truly are not plus size leggings (probably the equivalent of an xl/xxl at target) but the stretch on them is amazing! the best part is that there is no elastic waist, but rather it\\'s all one piece of super stretchy fabric. they\\'re also not too long, and hit just at my calves (i\\'m 5\\'3&#34;). they\\'re exactly like my old leggings, and i may buy another pair since i love them so much! kudos to taiga for going back to the old design!. these are great pants!  nice looking, and nice and warm.  i have been wearing them for years.  i had to knock off one star though, because quality control at the factory is not great.. over the years i have had to exchange pants due to one leg being longer than the other, and that kind of thing.  i love the pants, though, so it is worth the extra hassle. amazing! they\\'re the best fold over yoga pants i\\'ve had! i love them! ..i think i need more..<br />(more word requirement) these scrubs came in today. i was pleasantly surprised that they actually fit i\\'m 5\\'6 140 pds. the shirt is a fitted type but fit good. the length of the scrubs is perfect. the pants are long enough and also wide. if you\\'re looking for a slender leg this is not the one overall i was satisfied. i would buy this product in other colors. i got white, it\\'s sheer, and i could almost see my skin color through it. it would be perfect if it was a tiny bit thicker. since the top folds over, it doesn\\'t have to be as low riding as the other reviews described. i\\'m 5\\'6 and it\\'s a few inches too long in large. it\\'s soft and very comfortable. my friend said it best that &#34;white can be so unforgiving,&#34; but i dont care much for leggings. for the price, it is a very good product; just very thin material ~very nice and pretty leggings~does run a size small~thank you!! they looked and felt good. but sizes run very small so my wife sent back since didn\\'t fit. but good pj\\'s. comfortable , fabric is soft. ordered small and the fit is perfect. omg....i love these pants. i just received them today and tried them on. i am 5\\'4 and a size 13/15 in jeans. i ordered a large and they fit great, just a tad long. nothing a quick hem won\\'t fix :-) the white are a bit on the see thru side, but wow great fit and so comfortable. i am actually buying more right now.  great thank you! fits as expected i am so obsessed with these pants and i am a male! i want more like these! the product is what is says, and at that, it\\'s a steal. i ordered the red color and they are fantastic. the delivery was also very expeditious. if you own pairs of old r&r this jean doesn\\'t even come close in the appearance. look cheap to say the least. i would rate these 1 star if i was reviewing r&r jeans, i gave it 4 stars only not to scare away people who don\\'t care about the brand as much as the jeans would be of a decent quality for no brand pants. a bit see through but very comfy! so perfect! buying slytherin for my daughter! i love it!  it fits great and it will be perfect to dance in.  i will see if my dance team wants to purchase as well! i really like it! it fits perfect!  i like the fact it is not too thin but still feels durable. i love how it feels on my skin. it is very comfortable too because the fabric is stretchy.  i highly recommend this product! neat leggings! get lots of glances and many compliments!  not for vanilla dressers... they are perfect, love them.  ordering more! fits perfect ordered a large because of the reviews i am normally a small they r a little long but rolled up make awesome capris.... i love the comfort and feel of them and for just 10 dollars i can\\'t complain.... i do recommend ordering in two sizes bigger than ur normal size... :) this whole line of pants is really great. they fit me as expected and look great. i got compliments at the gym. i\\'m thinking of giving my old gym pants to goodwill! fit perfect and length was excellent!!! i received these ponte pants and gave them to  my mother because they were too big for me. the easy care fabric offers exceptional comfort and stretch to give you just the right amount of movement.  these can be worn to work and throw a blaze over it and you\\'re ready for a night out with your girlfriends with a touch of sophistication.<br /><br />you cannot go wrong with a good quality ponte pant. a lot of people confuse ponte pants with leggings but these are thicker and stretchier. they are soft and you can move very easily in these pants. the quality is great!<br /><br />i own ponte pants but they were retailed for $140 so this is a great deal. i highly recommend them and think they are a great value for the price.<br /><br />i received this product in exchange for an unbiased review. opinion stated is 100% mine!<br />http:www.mommyonrecess.com fits very nice also very comfortable. cool pants! super cute, fits true to size, only thing is that it\\'s a tad bit see through. not too much though. just don\\'t wear any bright underwear and you should be fine. comfortable and cute fast delivery they fit very well, not to long or short.  the front pockets are deep.  the back pockets are small but do have a small square of velcro to keep the flap closed.  the color is consistent and is not see-through.  the leg openings are loose, so not perfect for biking but very easy to put-on/take-off. really liked these pants, not to thick as some are.  i work in a kitchen and cafe and we have to wear black and sometimes its so hot.<br />but these pants are comfortable and wash well.  they were a little long but after washing it was better.  i will definately buy these again. comfortable fit. love the way they fit tight but not to tight love these pants top a little small, especially with the pockets full (life of a nurse). love to wear them. material very soft. anxious to see how long they last. can\\'t beat the price! compra exitosa, sin ningun tipo de problemas o inconvenientes, ropa nueva y en buen estado... more like a well made pant then a legging. this can be called a legging only for the narrow style and stretch material but this really is a very nice pant. the material is not at all flimsy but rather a high quality thick material.<br /><br />its super comfortable and a great fit. the waist has elastic too for ease to wear. the pockets have zipper detailing which makes it look really good. it will look good with any top or jacket. if you buy it, its going to be your favorite pair for sure.<br /><br />sample received at discount or no cost for honest opinion. i really enjoy the look of these pants, they are very comfortable but they are incredibly warm! for sure not very good for summer time. can\\'t wait to wear them come fall! i like these pants.  they are a soft material, and they are thick enough that every line and bulge doesn\\'t show through.  but definitely order a size up. my wife loves them. love them! fine quality pants and great colors. i just cut the hem to fit my 5\\'2 height and heel height of shoe choice, and wa lah. no fuss hemming! kinda of a quick fix! i get lots of compliments and questions of where to purchase! i have several pair of this thoe in  solids and patterns!<br />, i love the koi scrub pants. i\\'ve tried various brands of scrubs and i love koi brand the best. they are soft and very comfortable. they wash exceptionally well. little to no ironing needed and they do not fade. they are a bit more than other brands but you definitely get what you pay for. like them, but need to put elastic in waist. just a little weird, the cloth. it\\'s true, these do run very small.  i want to thank everyone with the good sense to share that these pants come fit for asian body genetics.  one reviewer was kind enough to tell us her dimensions and what fit for her, so i went off of that model and the m/tag m fit my frame perfectly.  thank you!  i am 110 lbs and 5\\'1\\'\\' with uncurvy hips.  i normally fit xs or s.  hopefully this guide will help you. wow!!! not only are these pants seriously cute & comfy.....they were practically delivered overnight!!!!! great product...great service! i will order again!!!! comfy, just right daughter loves em good fit. when i saw it thought it was going to fit too tight but material stretches these are my favorites ever!!! and they don\\'t shrink!!! nice but to small these are really nice pants and they look and feel great. i will definitely go back to this seller for more clothing in the future! red is hard to find the the stores. absolutely love these leggings great quality and fit- heavy material not for hot days. these kitty tights were the hit of our christmas eve white elephant party.<br />my son gleefully stole them from his sister-in-law and left her with poo pouri. comfy and fit well (i\\'m 5\\'7&#34;, 160#...think i ordered the large?  i can\\'t remember, and there\\'s no tag/label).  i use them for yoga practice, and they\\'re great for it.  however, the crotch gusset runs side to side instead of front to back. the bonus here is that it minimizes/eliminates camel toe.  the down side is that, pretty much immediately, they developed a run straight up the ass crack, and are getting another up the front.  this has happened with other leggings i\\'ve bought from different manufacturers with this kind of gusset, so i\\'m not surprised, but wish it were otherwise.  will probably order more from this same manufacturer. these jeans are meant to be torn up and destroyed because that\\'s a fashion trend that almost everyone loves!<br /><br />i received the jeans in a size large and i usually fit a medium perfectly, but these jeans were too small around my waist and wouldn\\'t button up at all. they were stretchy until it got to the button up part, then they were stiff feeling. although i was not able to take an appropriate phone with me wearing them i still adore the jeans and would tell any person wanting to purchase them to read the size chart and consider going up a size just to be safe.<br /><br />there are many qualities in these jeans that i really liked. i love the blue-jean color and feel to them. i also love the style of the jeans, they almost have like a 1990s style to them. there are many many holes and rips throughout the jeans and they\\'re so cute!!<br /><br />i would recommend these jeans!! absolutely love them, just wish i could wear them!<br /><br />disclaimer: i received this product complimentary for testing purposes. fun pants good love these!!! :) they look,and feel great!!! i want more colors.the price was very reasonable. highly recommend this product!! excelent somewhat small, extremely thin material. my girlfriend looks terrific in them... great shipping time, good quality, great price. i would order from this company again for sure. very comfortable to wear. the material is a bit thin, but for around $10 it has far exceeded my expectations on the quality. i\\'d suggest watching a video on youtube to see exactly how to wear it properly (just search for thai fisherman\\'s pants, and you\\'ll see a couple.)  once you know how to fold the sides and the top, it looks a lot better.  i\\'m not sure how long they will hold up if you do things like practice yoga, but great for lounging around i love these pants, super flowy and awesome. perhaps size down, the waist is extremely comfy and not a tight elastic so mine slide down throughout a walk. i have short legs and these pants are too long for me, something to keep in mind. i would order another pair a size smaller- perfect travel pants &#60;3 the bottom is perfect but is very large top these pant are so comfortable to wear like in the office and casual wear,it has and elastic on the back for a snug fit. these pants are everything i expected. nice fit good quality. looks fabulous great pants. washed several times and no problem with shrinkage or bad fit.  they make me happy. the price makes me happy. not too many things we can say that about these days. super comfy and trendy! i wore these to a casino for my birthday w/ a vest similar to the texture and i looked so good. my husband was all over me and would not let me out of his site. lol. they fit so comfy, i can bend, squat, seat whatever with no problem. i normally where a size 20 in non-stretch jeans but i bought a size 18 in these pants. love, love, love them! best workout outfit i have purchased. it fits great. so i bought a second one. good quality. arrived within a reasonable amount of time. so comfy! fits great. these stretch paints are fantastic. the don\\'t bunch up when sitting out kneeling down. they fit right to the skin, and smooth as well. most stretch pants move around when you move, thats ok, i get it, they should not bunch up. these do not bunch up.<br />shipping was fine. i had no problems with seller, i would buy from again.<br />thanks these are great.  dress them up or down and either looks great.  ive been wearing mine around the house as comfy clothes but you could easily add a pair of heals and a nice blouse and be on your way to dinner.  the fit is just right.  they don\\'t seem to be see through to me at all, no issues with rips or tears.  the length is definitely there love these pants. i bought the coral color also and love them just as much. i\\'m almost 5\\'7&#34; about 160 and these pants are long enough to still wear heels it is true to size ..very comfortable picked this out for my wife and submitted for her size and everything that they asked for.<br /><br />she loves and wears everything that came in the bundle and it all fits!!!<br /><br />happy wife, happy life!!!!! cute cover up pants for a swimsuit. i liked it. my small talls were too small and my medium talls were too big. came early! awesome product! a little big tho! :) i would give it a 5star but the pants really aren\\'t baggy. they are nice and fitted. the bags are too wide though they fit well and i will probably order more of them since it is hard to find pants that fit and are short enough for me. stylish and comfortable. plenty of pocket space. i have some older koi scrubs pants that are holding up well to repeated washings. this pants are soft, comfortable and flattering. i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; and they are a fine length with a heel. i\\'m believe they\\'d be a good fit for taller women as well. i purchased these in black as well and will probably get another pair soon. grest for casual or proffesional attitre! nice straight line to the leg. cute and comphy. light wieght.we will see how they wash. i love them, fit right, first pants i didn\\'t try on and fits perfectly! cute but goes up to my belly button. wear a long shirt. im 5\\'5&#34; 125 lbs have been looking for women\\'s cargo pants that fit and these are absolutely fantastic! would certainly buy again and again... thank you!! these yoga pants are very comfortable and easy to slip into. the color is more of a dark/medium than  \\'medium\\' brown. super comfy, great length, nice color very comfortable. another beautiful item from soul flower. unique and comfortable! this is the cutest, most comfortable thing.  love it. nice travel pants! perfect fit and very soft! the pant leg is a little tampered and unlike mine a bit wider but still comfortable! comfortable, true to size, it is thin but not see through. i live in miami and it is great for soemone who does not want to get hot wearing it. these shorts (i ordered black with white polka dots) were really cute. they fit nicely. i ordered a size large and i usually wear a size 8 or 10 in women\\'s jeans. the elastic is really stretchy. they are a little bit see through but i don\\'t think it will be too noticeable. they also got here way before the estimated shipping date i love them,  they are so comfortable! only concern is they are a tad see through. i just wore leggings under them and problem solved. very nice and i will order it in a different color heavy duty pants. great for all activities. stylish product with multicolored look is very attracting, comfortable to wear and wash.perfectly fits to the body.great product value for money. nice order came in a timely fashion and was exactly what i wanted. it fit ok although a little large; but i loved it. perfect fit and very comfortable. great skinny cords. very comfortable johnny was designs some lovely patterns and sensible styles. there are many styles to accommadate different sizes and preferences, i just choose my faves and rarely send one back and only if it\\'s too much work to alter it or i don\\'t think i\\'\\'ll ever wear it...rare!<br /><br /> i love these pants and will remain an avid fan of jw. very comfy but they are super long. i am 5\\'6&#34; and they are about 3inches too long. i will have to them them. great pants though, i thought the rabbit was a stitching but its like an iron-on sticker but otherwise, great. no issues, got them for my sister & she wears them a couple time a week.  they are thin & not too heavy or stiff. i like it lovely pjs, run true to size and are surprisingly flattering. haven\\'t washed them yet, so i don\\'t know how they\\'ll fare, but so far they\\'re very nice. excelent love them! i really like these color and fit are very nice! i would buy other colors too! these are great pants.  i\\'m a chubby girl,  i\\'m 5 ft 3 and about 170 lbs. i normally wear a size 12-14 in pants. i ordered a large in these.  my only complaint is that they were super loooong. luckily my mom was able to hem them for me.  seriously,  they were about a whole foot too long.  now that they are fixed,  it\\'s like a dream to wear these pants. the fabric is light and airy. they are high waisted and the legs are loose and flowing. very flattering for a curvy figure, with the right shirt. i wore them on a day trip to philly and when i got home i ordered 8 more pairs in different patterns.  yes, my mom did have to hem them all. some of them are kind of sheer, but a pair of leggings underneath does the trick. unique patterns, and comfortable  enough for a chubby girl to wear while seated in a car for several hours and walking around a big city without ever feeling like i had to unzip my pants lol. it\\'s like walking around in pajamas that are acceptable in a fancy restaurant. i\\'m a huge fan and might not ever wear anything else :) these are great. i get so many compliments on them. they are identical to the picture and fit perfectly but still wore them fine. i just wore these today and they are the most comfortable pants! they have a little more cotton than polyester in them which is really nice as well as having just the right amount of stretch to make them comfortable without stretching out too much. i tried on a few different pairs of the cherokee flexibles maternity ones in different sizes and i found they bunched awkwardly in the front. as for size: pre-pregnancy i was wearing the low rise flair leg pant with the elastic in the back and tie in the front in a size small which is the same size i got in these and they fit fantastically. i just placed an order for a second pair. like always good for elderly mom... i had an unplanned and unfortunate loss of a lot of weight recently and ordered these pants as a fast way to keep my pants from falling off until i can gain that weight back. they shipped fast and it was exactly as expected with the fit. i am 5\\'10&#34; and the small just barely is long enough and they fit so great i got tons of compliments (which is nice because when folks feel the need to tell me how bad i was looking because they noticed all my clothes starting to hang off...while they werent wrong it wasnt like i was oblivious to it and needed reminders!). bought two pair amd liked them so much jist went back amd purchased the 3 pack color option. i have skinny legs so it fits wonderfully in thighs, but if you have non-chicken legs may want to order size or two larger. i am a tall girl at 5\\'8 and am a big girl. these pants do run long, i had a good inch extra in the leg that i tucked into my sneaker during my gym visit. they are super comfy, especially in the waist. they stayed in place and i didn\\'t have to hoist them up. they are thin, but i threw some short shorts over the top and presto! the comfort and fit fit the price and i will be buying more. loved the pants, however they fit smaller and shorter than the ones i had purchased locally in our store :( good quality and price and allow machine wash. take note of the size because it is not so stretchy. great pants arrived fast, in nice quality packaging. i was concerned with the whole \\'one size fits all\\' thing. so i\\'ll try and help by explaining the fit as best i can.<br /><br />i wear size small zumba pants, size small victoria secret/pink boyfriend pants and yoga leggings.  i am 5 ft tall, have small hips but big thighs and calves. i have a larger than average waist size, only a fraction smaller than my hip size.<br /><br />these pants have a thick elastic waist that didn\\'t cut in too much. they look nice. since the style is to hike the cuffs up, the length wasn\\'t an issue given my height. the legs are tight to just above my knee. i should image it would be just below the knee for most average wearers.<br /><br />the fabric is soft and flowy. the print is very bold. i love the wide legs on these pants. they are wider than most palazzo pants.  that must be be because of the soho gaucho  cut. what ever it is, i really like them. the fit is as expected. i did have to cut the length off because i am 5\\' tall. i only cut off an inch because i like my pants almost touching the floor with heels on. i would rereccomend these to any and all . the fit and material feels really good. they are comfortable, they are fine. they could be a little bit longer. i needed pants to do some outdoor work in and wanted something with pockets.<br /><br />i don\\'t know if they updated the description since some of the poor reviews but they\\'re pretty accurate as of this review. make sure to measure yourself and match the measurements to the ones in the description because they do tend to run small. i\\'m a us6 and got the xl; fits great. i wanted them to be loose fitting but still flattering (because that\\'s what girls do :p) and these were perfect. they\\'re a nice heavy, durable cotton that will probably last through several washes. in the other reviews i read stuff about it being really long in the crotch but i don\\'t experience that at all; they\\'re normal rise and hit just below the belly button for me (i\\'m 5\\'2\\\\\\\\\").<br /><br />one thing i didn\\'t expect though was that the cargo pockets by the knees are actually two narrow pockets next to eachother, not one large pocket..which i would have found more useful, but that\\'s okay. also..the picture shows the pants with a belt, which mine did not come with. luckily i find the belt hideous and wouldn\\'t have worn it anyway haha.<br /><br />these were \\\\\\\\\"fulfilled by amazon\\\\\\\\\" so i received them in 2 days. easiest purchase ever. i got these for my daughter and she just loves them. i plan on buying more!!! they look nice and fit very well. the inner lining is not sewn in and the lining creeps up the back. otherwise, very cute pair of shorts. so comfortable! these are great pants, the material is really soft and they are very comfortable. great fit and good quality. i wear a small and ordered the medium and it was perfect in fit and length, i am 5\\'5&#34; tall. i just ordered another pair in black. i highly recommend. these are nice pants and i love the wide leg. they were alittle too large for me, but are made well and the style is great. being a unisex the pants are bigger than needed for female of petite size these are great, exactly what i\\'ve been looking for! i had a baby a few months ago, so i was looking for a pair of leggings that were somewhat high waisted. these are perfect. they are high enough so you aren\\'t cut off in the middle. smoothes everything out. the material is thick so you don\\'t feel like you\\'re wearing tights. there is definite support all over. very comfortable.<br />the only con might be that they seem a bit long. i am 5\\'4&#34; and they are slightly long for me. wouldn\\'t be a problem for most people though. i love these pants so much!  they fit like glove, no gap in the back at all when you bend down.  they stretch with you and you cannot tell they are not real leather! they are beautiful.  although they were a little long, hemming them was not a problem, which i did by hand. ok, it fit before i washed it, but haven\\'t tried it on yet.......... great pants, fits exactly as it should. thanks it looks more like a bathing suit than an outfil. but overall fits pretty good. im glad i purchased it i love love love this brand!  they last a very long time and don\\'t fade in color. it\\'s a bit long but the rest is great. these are the best scrubs we have found out there.  they are so soft and comfortable.  the fit is practically perfect.  the only change i would make would be to loosen the elastic at the waist.  at this price, you can\\'t go wrong.  we are going to buy in more colors for sure. pretty cool pants :) looks good with black hi-lo top :) and a jacket can dress these pants up or down :) love em short length- perfect for me at 5\\'4\\'....but wouldn\\'t work well for a taller person! these palazzo  pants are great!!  the fit perfect and are great quality.  i will be ordering more in the future. well made. easy to get  on and off for a handicapped person.  . love the pants, they are awesome, but they run really small compared to other vendors. can\\'t get into them yet, but almost! the only scrub pants i\\'ll buy! these are very small, the length is good though.  the xl are good, but they are 4&#34; to long. deb love these pants!! the company shorted me two pairs but immediately fixed the problem they fit perfectly! fits perfectly love the6 comfy i love them excelente these are very comfortable and have just enough stretch. they also do not bind at the waist. i am 5\\'4&#34; weigh between 120-124 and normally wear a size 4 (sometimes a 6) and these fit perfectly. i got them for stand up paddle boarding and they are perfect. these a very reasonably priced. in the photo it looks like they have a notch in the hem at the knee, but they do not. one of the other reviews said the crotch panel did not stretch and was uncomfortable. i do not know if they changed the design, but i did not find that to be true. they run a little small.  i never but them in the dryer or i will have to give them to my skinny daughter...lol.  love the fabric. the color of these leggings is not the same as shown here, it\\'s more pale and less bright. but except this, these leggings are great. the only slightest problem that i\\'ve experienced wearing those leggings is that some ladders may appear if you sit on something sharp-edged. just need to be more careful wearing it. didn\\'t know there were flowers on the bottom i like the fit around waist and hips.  material is soft and silky.  my only issue is that the pant legs are really long on me.  i\\'m 5\\'2&#34;, so these are obviously for a much taller person than i am.  they are supposed to be cropped to just below the knee, but they go all the way to the ground on me. purchased these pants in july 2014, but finally wore them oct 2014, they were so comfortable. love the material and received so many compliments that day for a party.  you will absolutely love these pants. i totally recommend them, your into a different look. my friends that night said you always know how to put different things together. omg these are so comfortable!!! i have a big butt for being a size small (weighing 120lbs) and it fit me pretty well. they breathe so great in hot weather. the only thing is that they wrinkle really easily so i have to iron them. it\\'s nice and comfy and different. if u like different clothing then you will love this.. came earlier than i anticipated, actually within few days. i love the quality and the style!! have to return and order a size up. i am an american small (3/4) but it ships from china so i need to get a medium in them. fast delivery perfect fit these are so comfy and perfect. they are also slimming as well. and they came befor the expected ship date. a bit large pants are supposed to be slimming, so by slimming they mean it will be very tight and show every nook and cranny. they are difficult to work out in, they slid down. arrived very promply and fit as expected. very nice design and comfortable fit upon reading the other reviews that these pants run small, i opted for a medium instead of the small and i\\'m glad i did! other than that, these pants are great so far, very nice material that hopefully doesn\\'t fade! nice pants for work or casual like the pants, style, comfort. was just a bit too small around my hips. will purchase a womens size next time. the scrubs fit perfectly and were really soft these are the greatest pants ever! i love their fit, although since i\\'m a bit tall they\\'re a little short for my taste. the rest of the pant makes up for this though. they\\'re rugged, comfortable, and useful! and they definitely look good on the booty! i recommend them for anyone who needs a good pair of pants for work or for play. what fun and unique pants! i am so glad that i gave this style a try because they are incredibly comfortable, well made and versatile.<br /><br />the design: the cotton fabric is soft and lets air flow so they dont feel too heavy- i wore them out yesterday (it was around 85 degrees) and didn\\'t feel too warm or like all the extra fabric impeded movement. they actually are great in the movement department because you can sit down and not worry about crossing your legs if you have a skirt on yet you get the flowy-ness (lol) of a skirt. there is also a pocket on the leg that, brilliantly, has a zipper to close it. with the pant having so much fabric and movement to them anything you\\'d put into such a big pocket may have fallen out so the zipper is great!<br /><br />the fit: on the label it says &#34;32-44&#34; so i was a little worried, being on the smaller side, that these pants would not fit. i was pleasantly surprised when i tried them on and they fit in both the ankle and waist/hips (you can wear them up higher or a little lower on your hips like in the picture). i have 33 inch hips and i was worried that these would fall off if i walked around but i wore them all day and they were both incredibly comfortable and stayed on. the waist and ankles are definitely designed to stretch so anyone with bigger measurements will fit into these as well- i call them the magic shrinking (or growing) pants i am 5\\'1&#34; and the length fit perfectly as well. im not sure if they would fit, length wise, anyone over 5\\'6&#34; though. they have a lot of fabric to stretch and move with but im not sure if they\\'d fit anyone taller....but who knows :)<br />the only drawback, and this will happen with any version of harem pant because of their fit, is that they make your legs look very short and your torso very long. this in no way impedes the cute design and comfortable factor, its just an observation.<br />fun, versatile pants for those with a different kind of style. the quality is good.  it\\'s a little small. these pants fit great, there very comfy ( there<br />not.tight in the waist ). i cant wait to wear them in spring bcuz they are not such a heavy material. i was very satisfied with this order. came quickly and fabric is well made a bit small for an xl but i expected that. just remember to order a size up if possible. i was surprised it actually fit. kind of stretchy material. shipping was faster than i expected; about two weeks. overall, well worth the money. will buy again these pants are sooooooo cute. the fit is so perfect can\\'t wait to wear them with my platform sneakers. the price is unbelievable received them in two days being a prime member i got the skeleton ones. they were a little tight and difficult to get on but once they were on, they were very comfortable. i get so many compliments when i wear them. i have purchased quite a few palazzo pants on amazon from a variety of sellers, these are the best quality i have received! they are thicker, not almost see-through and have a great flow! i\\'d suggest going down a size from what you normally order as they run quite large. i generally order a medium and could have easily fit a small in these as the mediums were quite loose all around. i\\'d highly recommend these for the quality though and the beautiful colors! well made true red color. fit well. only complaint is that you can clearly see the outline of the front pocket material and they are large. comfortable and soft mopas, thumbs up! love these!! they are cute and comfy and most importantly they stop chub rub!! they do run big. i am a size 18/20 and i got the xl. i\\'ve gotten closer to an 18, and they fit perfectly. when i was closer to a 20 they still fit pretty well. anyways, if you\\'re unsure, don\\'t be, they are worth it! see through and a bit small, but very, very comfortable. these are beautiful and look very stunning! i bought a medium, and it fits snug - slimming, but not too tight! i\\'m 5\\'7&#34; and weigh a true 130 pounds, i think if you\\'re 5 pounds heavier, it might be too tight. these are long enough, so i can still wear heals, as i often worry when buying things because i\\'m long-legged. the aqua color is not true...color is between medium-pale green/medium-pale blue, but more on the medium-pale green side. these pants run small as they are made for the asian market (i believe), but i ordered a xl (i\\'m usually about a 6) and they fit fine. they are very shiny material (like exercise clothes). but i love them and get compliments whenever i wear them. they are very fashionable and cute and fun to come up with outfits using. most comfortable scrubs i have found.  i am a massage therapist, so the ability to move around comfortably is a must. love the stretch panels.  i have several different designs of their tops and pants and love them all. so comfortable.  will not buy any other brand. these pants fit better than expected. i rated a 4 out of 5 because i\\'m short. they\\'re very long. they\\'re very comfy. i love these pants! the fit is flattering and very comfortable. i will definitely be back to order other colors. i would buy again!  if you are a size 14-16 size large will fit you well. the most comfortable pants i own. these are really comfortable, stylish pants. they were exactly what i wanted. the fit wasn\\'t what was expected. haby brand is great! i\\'m a nike girl but this is my new workout clothes brand for sure. the price, quality and look is sensational. i\\'ve been looking for cargo pants like that for a long time: enough loose so it feels comfortable, yet fitting so it wouldn\\'t look baggy. i also like the material, although it\\'s a bit too hot for miami (80-85f) weather. i\\'m 5\\'5\\'\\' and 117 lbs and the us 6 option fits perfect.<br />would definitely recommend the item for those who\\'s looking for comfortable cargo pants. they fit well and are very comfortable. these pants have a great fit.  i find them extremely comfortable and they look very nice.  great for casual or for dressing up a little with the right blouse.  will buy again. i love these scrub pants because they really stay well after many washes. they have lasted the longest out of all band names! these leggings fit perfectly & look really trendy! i have worn them several times & love the way they fit! great after reading the reviews i ordered a size medium when i usually fit into a small for stretch pants. i am only 5&#34;2 and the inseam on this fits perfectly like jogger pants without the saggy butt. it is true that the pants run small, in fact the medium are still pretty snug on me! however, these pants are super adorable and comfortable. i highly recommend them, just be prepared to order a size or two up!!<br /><br />summary: ordered medium 5&#34;2 (38 inch hip), snug and length is perfect, recommended but if you want space go bigger. im always looking for a nice pair of linen pants and the task seemed impossiable. i purchased a large ( im 5\\'9&#34;) and they are perfect. they just brush the floor and they are extremely comfortable. they came very promptly and i love the way they look.  they could be for a night on the beach and are dressy enough that adding a pair of heels and a cute top to these pants makes a great look for a more formal night out. love them, i\\'d buy another pair in a heartbeat. love love love. purchased the size i normally do, but chose the petite length (im 5\\'4) they fit perfect and the material is so comfortable. very comfortable and easy to clean look great on -great price too. fits as expected.  have ordered more.  material is a little thin but that\\'s ok. the pants are mostly viscose, but drape and feel like twill.  hefty material, quality far better than the picture, european menswear style, low rise, longer than normal, with a belly area one size larger than the size listed.  should be easy enough to insert 2\\\\\\\\\" non-roll elastic into the waistband, but you\\'ll have to be careful to cut the elastic much shorter, and you\\'ll have to sew both ends of the elastic in front carefully, since the front is a hook and zipper closure.  or, just take the sides in.<br /><br />very surprised at the nice quality.  in an effort to shrink the belly area and length of the pants, i washed them in hot water and dried on high cotton heat.  they did not shrink.<br /><br />pockets are shallow (two in front, two in back). i love this material and the fit was perfect. i would purchase this again. price was a bit steep though. somewhat small. covers my saggy skin after weight loss this product i wear all the time but didn\\'t realize i needed to order a bigger after i put it on but i still like i am full-figured with hips and a bit of a gut... these pants give me a perfect comfortable fit. they are made of a high quality material that i just love. i am 5\\' 9&#34; so i am glad they had tall. they fit just the way i want them to over the top of my boots. finally - a plus sized product that fits the way they say it will! thank goodness they have a wide selection of colors... i will be ordering more! i love these pants! nice material and they feel very well made. i\\'m usually a size 4/6 but i read reviews as well as seller\\'s description so i ordered a size larger which is a medium. delivery was fast. overall very happy with my order. these are comfortable and light weight.<br /><br />cons they are thin. i would not recommend wearing them out without leggings or something under them. these fit as expected. i do not like low rise work out pants and the fold over part of these make it easy to wear however you like. stetchy, light material...perfect for summer!!! great fit. really comfy. not too short. they fit like a small i love it i absolutely love my lysse leggings.  i rarely can find boot cuts that fit.  i hate the too tight skinny jeans and jeggings.  these are my favorite go to jeans and they look dressy so i wear them everywhere! these pants are comfy and amazing. i\\'m five feet and they were a very little but too long, but nothing nursing shoes can\\'t take care of i just receive my leggings on last friday . i the best leggings i seen in along time i will order more i just received these and tried them on and i\\'m  happy with my purchase. i am 5\\'2&#34; and 110lbs and they are form fitting (tight around my butt) and cover my whole butt. they are like yoga shorts from vs in fit and length.  can\\'t say whether or not they ride up but they are very comfortable. the material is soft and seems durable. i received the right colors (black with mint band and edges). i am very happy with the purchase and am thinking about ordering another pair! i love these scrubs! they fit as expected and the material is so soft! i love the touch of purple on the collar. there is plenty of pockets. it\\'s hard to tell from the picture but the top has 6 pockets. i don\\'t remember how many are on the pants but there are plenty. it was my first time to buy a pair of pants online and i\\'m happy that i purchased a right one! i felt really nervous while opening the package and oh boy! oh boy! those were perfect, specially the side belts let you adjust it on your waist specifically. the material is light and i feel cool in it. i strongly recommend these pants for hot summers. very confortable! great fit, soft fabric, and perfect for just relaxing around the house. i might have to pick up a couple more pairs just so i can wear them all the time. as they promised.  good quality and nice to work with. i just received these today and i love them. they fit perfectly and are not too baggy. the material is sturdy but not uncomfortable. i love how many pockets they have to fit tools, gloves, etc. i hope they have the rest of the prints in stock soon so i can buy another pair. i\\'ll update my review once i see how these hold up while i work. good fit. i\\'m 5\\'10 and they were long enough. material a little lighter than expected but good for summer. good purchase for price. ordered additional pairs in different colors. great fit, perfect length, great quality and overall great linen pant for the $! the button details are so very cute and these pants wash and lay flat dry and still fit great after 1st washing so comfy and i get lots of complements looks very nice love them! i wear these all the time. don\\'t put them in the dryer. it says to hand wash, but i machine wash, line dry. i am 5\\'2&#34; about 112lbs, and the small is perfect. i\\'m not stick thin either, i got some curves going on- just for everyone else\\'s reference. these were a little too roomy-i\\'m a size 9 but i\\'m 4&1/2 months pregnant...i ordered the larger size so they would remain comfy as i gained weight with this pregnancy. i lived in my vs pants that were very similar to these except in material quality...my old vs pants lasted 5 years? they wore out finally-got holey by all the seams and were really faded, but elasticity still was great-material is thicker. i dont know if newer vs pants are made differently, as one reviewer said this product\\'s quality was higher, but these dont match my old pants-these are so much thinner. that said, they are decent-very light material with lots of elasticity-so you would likely be able to order a size down and get some nice shape support. wish i had just gone with a large-which is a size up from what i would usually get. these will be saved for use exclusively as maternity pants. good overall value for the price. always get the fit i want. i am 5ft. 9 inches tall my inseam is 34 to 35. i am always on the lookout for pants in my size. these pants can be dressed up or down and you will look great in them. they are one of my favorite go to pants. they are very comfortable and i highly recommend them i will be purchasing more in different colors the will be great in the warm weather. i bought the white ones to use to cover up under a somewhat sheer dress, they worked out well. they\\'re shiny and slippery so they didn\\'t catch on the dress. i\\'m 5\\'3 and 118lbs, they fit fine, and you can\\'t see through them. i\\'d expect them to fit up to at least 135lbs. the only reason i didn\\'t give five stars was because of the waistline. they\\'re those kinda pants that are cheaply made and don\\'t really have a front or back to them. they fit the same way either way you put them on, so they kinda always feel like they\\'re on backwards, and a little loose around the top, to account for the one size fits all. but hey, i think i paid $6 for them, i have nothing to complain about. they worked for my needs, and will be good to wear under jeans  and stuff in the winter. i am 5\\'10&#34; with most of that my legs and these pants are long enough.  they are comfortable and not too thin at all; perfect weight for summer in tx. this item was so perfect for a costume i needed, i\\'ve decided to buy a couple more for everyday wear. theses pant look just as pictured. they are vert comfortable and light weight. fun summer pants. nice fit wonderfully with athletic build.  good quality fabric.  highly recommend. i am very please with this item! the fabric is very soft. feels very comfortable. i just bought 3 different styles for my mom! loose fit comfy, thin material but good enough quality still i just got these after ordering and returning the spanx denim leggings. these fit like a dream, suck me in, and are so comfy.  they aren\\'t \\'denim\\' per se but do look enough like it.  i am an 8-10 and ordered a medium which fits well. love these! compliments for days. a lovely pair of slacks.  the drape is perfect.  the slacks are a bit too long.  as someone who is 5\\' 4&#34; tall, petite can be just right or too short.  i have found that choosing regular height is better.  i can alway hem the slacks if i need to.  all in all, a good buy. love them excellent!! love these pants; as soon as i received them, i tried them on. great fit..i ordered two more pairs 😊 great item @ a great price i ordered these pants in a large which is the general size i usually order as i am 5\\'10 and wear a size10-11 usually. they are a little bit loose in the top area, but if i were to order a medium i fear they would have been too short. :( so basically, i have this problem with many pants so i wasnt too surprised by how these pants ended up fitting. i gave them a 4 star rating because of the great price and the comfortable feel of the material. i may order another pair in a medium just to see the length difference. i hope this helps all my tall friends out there! so comfortable. i ordered these for lounging around the house. i wear them all over the place, and they are so soft. good material but way too big for a petite medium. i love them alot, keep my body cool. like alot love these. have many styles  colors previous reviews are accurate! usually, i wear an 8/m and i ordered an xl and they fit. i can wear long underwear and jeans underneath these and still be comfortable. my shipping date was originally estimated to be a 6-8 week delivery but i received it within two weeks. these pants, feel great on i love them so much i sleep in them i am always skeptical about buying pants online because of my shape they never fit well. (tiny waist, big butt, and thickish thighs.) i bought these on a chance and i am so glad i did. they have just enough stretch to fit perfectly! i am 5\\'7&#34; usually jean size 4/6 and they are perfect length as well. very true when it says to order next size up just in case. love them! comfortable pants price, fit, and color is exactly what i wanted. i like the way these pants fit and so i bought 2 more pairs. i am tall and the extra length size is perfect. the best thing about them is the comfort. the quality is better than i expected it to be and i am very happy with my purchase. had to wear a full length leg brace and needed palazzos to cover it.  i love these, but they were a little large, i should have ordered the next size smaller...i was desparate, so i just used a belt to hold them up. the fabric is a bit thin and i am glad i had black.  it flows so nicely when you walk.<br />next pair will be a size smaller. i this particular short for my  yoga these pants are soo comfortable, the fabric is so soft . i love these pants, they are one of the favorites in my wardrobe. these are a nice well made pant not cheap looking. just very nice, nice weight fabric hangs well. they look great and can be dressed up or down. great product. shipment arrived in a timely manor, neat packaging. sizes  run a little smaller then normal so be sure to order a size or 2 larger then your normal us size. material is lightweight & pant leg zips off easily. i love these pants.  they are so comfortable and warm.  the fleece inside is great against the skin. perfect 😍 was purchased as a gift, she was happy with them, as she picked them out! just received it and tried them on. i ordered an xl and normally i wear a 2x, perfect size, working out with them was no problem. amazing sweat too!!! pants fit like i expected.  i am happy that it is possible to get something that fits my disportionate frame. i am a big fan of koi lindsey. those who are about 5\\' 3 at about 115 lbs, not all brands work in our favor.  x- small petite of these pants are just perfect. i remember the very first time i wore them, i couldn\\'t help but noticed that my husband of 18 years was checking out my butt. it is one of those products you know will look good on you before you even tried one on.  this style is not as easy to maintain though. i iron & starch my uniform. that\\'s just me. because of the pleates midway on the inner sides. you just can\\'t run the iron front, back and side to create the pleated look.  now that i finally have one in almost every color, the hospital i am working has a uniform policy coming up. i might just have to pick up extra shifts somewhere. am not getting rid of my koi lindseys for sure! i\\'m 5\\'4&#34; so these are really long on me. but i can cut and hem them to wear with heels. i\\'m a size 8. a medium fits well not too tight or clingy. for the price i\\'m happy :-) colors match the pic. i liked these pants but they are long.  i\\'m 5 ft. 8 inches and they are on the ground so that\\'s long.  but not a problem because i can wear appropriate shoes or boots with these.  i might even hem the bottoms.  but all in all i like them and would have given 5 stars except for the length.  that is a good thing though since most people like their jeans long. i purchased these pajamas because i was looking for plain black, all cotton pajamas that were suitable for lounging or sleeping. these fill the bill and wash/dry just fine without undue shrinkage or coming apart. this is important because some products which are \\\\\\\\\"inexpensive\\\\\\\\\" soon wind up costing more when they come apart almost immediately. since they are black you can wear them with virtually any of your favorite pajama tops, tee shirts, or sweat shirts. it fits perfectly and when i run it doesn\\'t slip down!  i\\'m a size 10 and purchased a medium if that helps. excellent i was given the chance to try these leggings in exchange for my opinion and i love them.  they are so cute.  as a plus size girl it is often hard to find cute and stylish leggings that don\\'t fit wrong in all the wrong places...i mean, just because i\\'m a big girl doesn\\'t mean i can\\'t be stylish, right?  this fabric is nice and stretchy, yet it always goes right back in its place.  the stitching is very nice and stylish...very well done.  the pants feel great on...very comfortable.  they are easy to take care of.  all in all i would have to say that these are my new go to pair of black leggings.  they look so cute with an over-sized shirt.  they are cute and comfy...what more could a girl want? they look tiny coming out of the package, but they do have stretch to them. i am normally an xl and decided to try these out. they fit great and don\\'t slide down. so far, they have not shrunk in length or size. oh my, i really like these very cute and flattering pants.  i wear it for bellydance and out on the town, and it\\'s really a great look. as expected.  great fit. these leggings worked perfectly for my assassin cosplay! they were sexy, easy to move in, and fit so well! the only unfortunate thing is the wear of the shiny liquid look after use. by now, the knees are shiny no more, and the liquid look is somewhat dull and broken after a couple dozen washing and wearing, but i still love to wear them. great fit  and great colors ! these shorts are soft; stretch very well and cover enough of the tummy area - fitting just under the belly-button, so not low rise.  no rolling of the waist.  on first look, they appear as if they will not fit; even to get on one leg - but that is not so.  i normally wear a size 10 to 12 pants and the large fit perfect! just matched the top i had. looks awesome i am 5\\'8\\\\\\\\\", currently 140 (still have to lose the last 10 lbs of baby weight from having twins) and ordered a large thinking these would run a little small (generally am a m, wear size 27 long in jeans if that helps). i should have ordered the m as they run true to your regular size. but, the pair i have, though too large for workouts, will work for lounging and hanging around the house. they are soft and comfy but will most likely order another pair in a m for yoga....<br /><br />update: have washed and dried in dryer--- still have same shape and size as before which is great, but i will probably order the small for yoga so they won\\'t fall down. i know it says \\\\\\\\\" junior sizing\\\\\\\\\" but its not----if it is, they run large by a size or two... these are really great work pants for the price. the material does not wrinkle and they are very comfortable. i\\'m usually a size 6 (pre-pregnancy) and i got a \\'small\\'. at first i thought they are a little snug at the hip, but after a couple of wears, they are perfect. i am a 5\\'2&#34; woman and 130 lbs. i got a small and they fit me well. i think they would still fit me well if i gained or lost 10 pounds. the material is stretchy and the fit is flattering on the lower belly and hips. they are a little long so i\\'ll have to wear them outside of the house with high shoes but i love just wearing them around the house. i want to buy more in different colors. but unfortunately i can\\'t find these anywhere else online and these only come in the grey color, which is fine, i just want more! i love these pants! however, this is my first try with yoga pants and i would like them to fit a little looser around the hip area. i am going to order another pair and try the large size instead of medium (i am 5\\'6&#34; and 36.5&#34; around the hips). otherwise i love these pants. they are cute and really comfortable and cool. i gave these as a gift to my mom for christmas. they arrived nicely packaged and on time. my mom said that these are the softest and warmest sleep pants she has ever had. my mom is actually allergic to the cold and it causes her pain, swelling and hives. she loves these pajama bottoms! these lounge pants are great.  very comfy and warm.  pair with some fluffy socks, pick out a good book or watch a movie and your good to go! the pants are made of a fabric comfortable to wear and flexible, the style is very trendily but there is one problem they aren\\'t sew in the stomach upper part nice okay, i\\'m a huge fan of &#34;harem&#34;, &#34;hip hop&#34;, drop crotch&#34;, &#34;hammer&#34; pants and these are right up there with my favorites.  i am a dancer and like to wear things i can move in but are still stylish and current.  these pants are all that, plus a little more. i just received the pants today and i couldn\\'t wait to try them on.  i love how they feel/fit.  i\\'m 5\\' 4&#34; and wear a size 12-14.  i have an hourglass shape and these pants fit perfectly.  they are a bit longer than expected, but i\\'m happy overall! these pants are fantastic in a hot climate. i love the huge legs and the cool fabric. i am very pleased with my purchase. love! except they were very very long, even with heels they drag. i am 5\\'1 - 5\\'2 excellent product very sexy, good quality and it fits great! love this pants, plus the color is gorgeous! i recommend this product these pants fit as expected. however they are slightly higher rise than i prefer. i am 5\\'3&#34; 145lb ordered a medium and they come past my belly button. i also hoped they would be a bit fuller in the leg, but they are as pictured. but this was fine. overall, i will wear them to the gym and for the price they are perfect. the weight is good: light enough to work out but not see through! they fit great! the smaller size was way too small, but this size fit. however, you may want to know that you have to hand wash these in cold water.  when i washed mine in the sink, the water got kinda dark, so maybe the dye is coming off.  i don\\'t believe they were actually dirty.the tag says you can tumble dry low, but i would just hang them to dry.  they are a little bit see through when held up to the light, possibly due to the very thin fabric.  i don\\'t know if they will shrink or not.  it says they are made of 96% polyester, and 4% spandex.  i didn\\'t think that was something that would shrink, but i think it may stretch.  hope that is helpful. the print that should have been around my thigh was way to high.  they seemed a little light weight but not enough that i would have sent them back for that reason.  sorry that i have to return them.<br />thanks. looks great. a must buy!! i love the look and feel of these, stylish and not transparent.<br />comfortable to wear out or just lounge around the house in! high quality material<br />as well. i would reccomend you go a size down if you want a body hugging fit, other<br />than that their perfect!!! nice, comfy pants, good price, but beware of the size. yoga pant fit great and very comfortable, washes well i love these pants! they fit perfectly, super comfy, great stretch, always shrinks back to original size after a wash, for the perfect fit every time. super soft too! :) i\\'ve worn these a few times already and they are the most comfortable pants. i especially love them for traveling on a plane. i bought these specifically to wear in humid weather and i felt cool and didn\\'t feel sticky. the band around the waist has gotten a bit loose so i can\\'t hold my cellphone in the front pocket anymore without the front drooping. the colors are still great and i plan to wear these to my upcoming trip in august to taiwan. comfy. fit as expected. i wanted comfortable linen pants with a cotton fold over waist. thats what i got. they were a little longer than i expected and im 5`6<br />but i still like them especially for the price amazing they are a little thin for flannel, but they are comfy and fit pretty true to the chart. i might go a size up for comfort. one pair of jeans can give you so many versatile looks they will look great with whatever top and foot ware you pair with it. they jeans are stylish and comfortable will a feel good fit that helps boost confidence they have stretch to them but not as much as jeggings and they are a nice quality material thank you these pants are cute, comfortable, machine washable and durable.  i have worn them about 20 times in the few weeks that i have had them, washing between each wearing, and they have held up well.  plus, i paid just over $20 for them, so they are a great value for that price too--certainly as nice as pants that cost twice as much.<br /><br />i would recommend these pants to anyone who is looking for some decent yoga pants at a reasonable price.  these aren\\'t fancy, but they do the job. fit the way i was hoping these are great. these pants are so comfortable! the material isn\\'t flimsy, which is a concern for yoga pants sometimes.  i was worried about the size but they fit me just fine and i have room to grow. (i am on the smaller side.) the only &#34;complaint&#34; i guess i could make is that the colors are much brighter in the picture online than in the actual pants.  this was a great purchase! i love these pants! they are so comfortable and stylish. true to size, sweat profusely when working out. love it. love it - worn all the time! landau cargo pants have been a favorite of mine for many years..  they fit well, wash nicely and last a long time.  this seller offers a great price and outstanding service.  its another satisfying purchase i have made on amazon very soft, looks just like photo but for l they are short and tight decent. what was expected. although, the material did surprise me with how comfortable it is. i just received these pants in the mail today.  i got one pair in navy and another in brown.  these are awesome!  i think i have new favorite pants!  i am a curvy girl with an hourglass body type and thick thighs... wear a size 16 to 18 in pants and am 5\\'8&#34;.  i ordered the extra large.  these pants make me look at least a size, if not 2, skinnier, and fit like a dream.  they are thin and comfortable like good yoga pants, but they are also nice enough to wear to work with lots of different styles of tops.  the only complaint i can think of is that i wish there were more colors available in my size. :)  i have another pair of leggings queen pants that i get a lot of compliments on, but i like these even better.  they are nicely fitted in the body, but the legs are flowy and plenty long.  if you\\'re contemplating ordering these pants, i say do it. i love these pants, they are perfect for my job.  they are so comfortable and wash so great and just lay them on a rack to dry. i love the way they fit.  they are truly the size they say they are.  however, after wearing them twice the in seam is already coming unsewn.  i am disappointed about that, but otherwise good. love these!!! just receive the shorts and my daughter loves them. they have a cute little belt and look just like the picture. thanks i will most definitely be ordering more from this seller. shipping was quicker then expect to. these pants shrunk about 3 inches in length when i wash/dried them (cold wash/regular dry). for me, this worked out pretty well, since initially they were too long. i was planning on getting them hemmed--thankfully i washed them first! i\\'m 5\\'5&#34;, although my legs are short enough that i typically have to buy petite sizes for pants. after washing, these are actually about a half inch too short! but i say close enough.<br /><br />the fabric feels soft, but sturdy. it\\'s heavy--more like sweat pants than yoga pants/leggings--so i would recommend these for colder weather. love it! a little thicker than tights. they look really nice on. excelente the pants came quickly, and are pretty comfortable. i got a large, and they fit well (5\\'8 and 171lbs). the only problem i have is that they\\'re not quite as long as i expected. especially with all the reviews saying they were too long for people. i will definitely be buying more. these became my go to pants they are comfy, made well and look nice and feel good on. leggings are very comfortable.  washed a couple of times and they seem to be fading  :(<br /><br />hope not...otherwise a very nice legging. comfy and soft! wouldn\\'t want to wear any other style. being that they are tights and not pants they are exactly that. love them for what they are. soft, comfortable and seem well made.  it is a good value for the price.  the only disappointment is that they do seem quite large for a medium. love these pants. exactly as pictured. i should have ordered a small/med instead of med/large for a better fit. i\\'m 5\\'4 120 and recently ordered a small/med of the brown/beige pants. they fit perfect around my waist but it seems like one leg is a little shorter than the other and the pants might not be sewn even, it feels a little lopsided like to make the seams, print, and pockets symmetric the back has to be yanked up higher. oh and very fast shipping. super comfy, going to order more colors.  did stretch out a little bit after wearing all day but after a quick run in the dryer they are good as new!! gift for my mom and she loves them. love the pants perfect fit, no fuss with receiving the order! great price omg! i love the material of this product, i wasn\\'t sure as to how i should have ordered the size. i\\'m a 13, and ordered this in medium, it\\'s slightly snug for my taste, but i\\'ll get over it lol. i can\\'t stop rubbing my knees when i wear them because of the softness of the fabric, lol. :d i liked the cut, didn\\'t leave big gaps around the sleeves etc. but it\\'s also a bit small around the tummy. i\\'m a bigger gal, so i would go a size up when ordering again. just a little tight around the waist... one size up... but cute pants...very sexy i love it! i just already ordered 2 more! love the jump suit very comfortable! love these! the pants are true to size and the flare is perfect for yoga.  they are tight to skin which is what you need i usually order xl but was advised by a reviewer to order one size smaller. she was right. i ordered large and they fit well. i ordered one pair and liked them, so i ordered two more. while they aren\\'t perfect, they are close. i am 5&#34; tall and even petites are a little too long. these are about 2 inches too long but i can live with that. the only disconcerting thing is the elastic tends to roll on the waist line. great purchase soft material i love them i will purchase more of them from this vendor very comfy i am so happy with these boot cut leggings.  they are so sharp looking.  i really like the fabric, so soft. if it was just a little bigger i would have kept them i really loved the color but it was just al ittle too tight for me. wife likes them. has used quite a few scrubs for work over the years. these have a good fit and she likes the pockets. i really like the fit of the pants. they definitely run small, i\\'m usually a large and i got the xl and it\\'s still a bit tight but not uncomfortable. i\\'ll try a different but i really liked the black. i think i\\'ve ordered a pair of these in every color they have in my size.  they are great in both fit and feel and wash up very nicely (even softer than they already are}. these are my scrubs of choice. the providers at my er are actually required to wear &#34;business casual&#34; during the day and i pass the black ones off as dress pants with the drawstring tucked into my waist. this way i don\\'t have to wear my actual clothes to the hospital (gross). i am usually a size 2-4 in regular pants and i find the xs to be a touch too loose in the legs and while an xxs works great in the legs, it\\'s a little tight getting it on over my hips, but i make it work. it\\'s a nice option for a brand to even offer an xxs in my opinion! love it i liked these ones when i first got them they were very long but they shrunk when washed .. ! nice for price, a bit thin but soft and cuddly jody. many compliment love these!!!!!!! i wore them for the first time last night and i got so many compliments, people asked me repeatedly where i got them, and even asked to take pictures with me wearing them. they are that jaw dropping. fit great. fast delivery. love the wide leg and the way the fabric moves around the legs.  these are really comfortable, but i wish they came with elastic in the waist to help hold them up.  when i wear them to work i find i am constantly pulling them up throughout the day. nice fit and material really comfortable they fit well but i need to hem them because they\\'re too long. i bought a size xl and i\\'m 5\\'8&#34;, wt. 175.0 lbs. fit is good, but the black fabric seems to be fading with just a couple washings which is disappointing to me. perfect pair of pants for the gym, yoga or whatever other fitness activities! these pants fit me great just like how i wanted it, and i order for this really important event and they came in on time. the only thing was they were a little long but i need them that way because i was wearing heels. these pants are amazing true to size. if you are thinking about ordering them you should. i am definitely a medium to small, but i had purchased a medium earlier and after wearing the pants for about an hour, i began to feel really squished.  the large seems much better...sort of reverse vanity sizing... absoluly butiful.exactly like pi ture.lo ey soct a d cool .aterial.its truely 1 size.they are perfect. i was worried my phone wouldn\\'t fit in the pocket but it does. they\\'re super cute! i have these in black, size medium.  i am generally an 8 in pants and these fit well.  they are super comfortable and you could probably get by wearing them if you are a size 10, as well.  the material is soft and drapes well and it is easy to move while wearing these.<br /><br />the waistband is quite high and can be folded down.  the stitching is good with no holes or loose threads.  the color is even and consistent throughout and the pants are opaque.  because these fit loosely, they could be worn outside the house without looking like they\\'re exercise clothes.<br /><br />the length was good for me but i am only 5\\'5\\\\\\\\\".  and due to the relaxed fit, you can wear these high or low on the waist/hips, as you desire.  they actually were pretty good as exercise pants because i had freedom of movement (and without being squeezed).<br /><br />overall, i definitely am glad i tried these.  it\\'s a nice change of pace to have exercise clothing that\\'s well-made and comfortable without breaking the bank (currently these go for under twenty-five dollars).<br /><br />product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes. very soft, perfect fit , i\\'m a medium/large, large fit perfectly.too comfortable for words, i haven\\'t decided if i\\'ll wear them out or just around the house.washed them, nothing changed.<br /><br />a year later, i still love these pants, everybody is asking me about them. they\\'re the most comfortable piece of clothing i own, i just love them. from some reviews i understand that some buyers don\\'t really get the cut of these pants, they\\'re suppose to hang , look oversized.  the fabric is so soft, it hangs and flatters any size, they\\'re not bulky. they look beautiful with gladiator sandals or heels , i feel a little gypsy when i wear them and that\\'s such a great feeling, wild and free. get them, you won\\'t regret it. it\\'s hard for short curvy girls (i\\'m 4\\'11 and 14/16) to find leggings. maternity leggings--nearly impossible!<br /><br />i ordered a pair of these and couldn\\'t be happier. these are opaque and not shiny. i probably could have gone with a medium but i am sure that these will shrink a bit after washing. the belly panel is definitely sized for later in pregnancy. the length was great on me--just above my ankles. i look forward to wearing these with tunics and long sweaters this fall and winter.<br /><br />buy these leggings-i doubt you\\'ll regret it. i think that i just might order another pair! love them thanks to the fastest shipping ever!!!<br />i\\'m quite impressed with them and my husband loves these on me as well.<br />would definitely consider buying again. the pj pants fit quite well and were just what i have been looking for.  they are light weight and wash well too. these pants are really comfortable. i actually bought them because i\\'m almost 8 months pregnant and my original yoga pants didn\\'t fit anymore and i didn\\'t want to spend a bunch of money on &#34;maternity yoga pants&#34;. i\\'ll probably wear them after my baby is born to work out in (though, i\\'m sure they\\'ll be a bit big after that, but still comfy!) they\\'re a thinner material, but they\\'re also stretchy. would recommend. they are ok, happy with my purchase i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; and usually wear a us med but wanted these in large so i could wear them after abdominal surgery. they were perfect. soft material, cozy fit and a nice long length. if you have short legs you may find these too long. because of the nice stretch, i can see wearing these even after losing some weight. the color is really light so you may want to wear buff colored undies or skip them altogether if you plan to wear them with a short top. slightly tight around the calf, however, overall love the style and fit. fits great, pretty true to size. not so thin that they\\'re see through in the light. definitely a good buy!<br />i received this product free to try, but all opinions expressed are my own i like it very much. good quality and nice design. these are a great product and fit well for all ... i would recommend them to everyone.  liked the fit. my wife got these and she loves them love the pants...different material than what i was expecting but actually liked it a lot. i\\'ve already worn them a few times and they are so comfortable...can either be dressed up or down. item arrived earlier than expected. love these pants for my mom and can\\'t find them in local department stores anymore. thanks, amazon, for offering them! i just wish they came in a larger selection of colors. we get tired of black, brown, and navy. these wine colored ones were a nice change. also bought a pair of the brown ones.  any chance of pastels for the spring/summer in the future? love it these are not in women\\'s sizing.  i am a small-ish woman.  5\\'4&#34; 130 lbs.  i would usually order a medium but i ordered a large because i think lounge pants should be roomy.  these barely fit me.  if they shrink in the wash, there is no way i will ever be able to wear them again.<br />the pants themselves are very nice.  my only problem is with the sizing. love the pants.  they are super comfortable for zumba.  i am usually an &#34;extra large&#34; but saw the reviews that said they run big so i ordered a large.  i am keeping them but i ended up ordering another pair in size medium.  they are comfortable as well but probably just a little snug for an xl gal like me.  love the feel and fit. i love hemp clothing.<br />these pants are just a bit too long for me at 5\\'4&#34; & the fabric is a little thin (not see through), but they\\'re really comfy. i bought these to wear to a x-mas pj party to match my hotpink rindstone avon t-shirt i had custom made. it also went great with my matching hat and slippers. i wanted the \\\\\\\\\"lips/kisses\\\\\\\\\" to represent my cosmetic buisness. good item as expected, arrived promptly. nice pants but a bit snug for me. great pair of basics and they wash well. i didn\\'t expect to, but had hopes.  i really do like them.  i\\'m a yoga teacher and i\\'ve used them already to teach several classes.  they are comfortable, soft and they let me move freely. i can\\'t tell you yet how they stand up under machine washing.  you probably should buy them at least a size larger than you ordinarily would. these are great fitting pants with a nice material! the length is enough for someone 5\\'7! love it!!! these leggings were used for the crab costume for the little mermaid.  it was perfect, and the red was the exact shade that we needed.  thanks, i love these shorts! they are so comfortable and perfect for my yoga practice. i\\'ve wanted a pair like these for awhile now and this was the cheapest i could find. i got a medium and they fit great. they fit perfect, love the leopard, they are perfect size and length and are my new favorite go-to yoga pants! not much description provided online, so i was surprised the pants had a zipper instead of elastic waist.  the fabric had a nice sheen.  i certainly got more than i expected for the price of these pants.  they fit great and received tons of compliments at the 60\\'s party. i love it bought it for my wife. comfortable and easy to do anything in i have been searching for the perfect yoga pants and have finally found them! for some reason similar long slim pants in styles like prana or beyond yoga look horrible on me because they emphasize my hips and thighs in weird ways.  these fit me so well and are amazingly attractive.  i feel great, and find them super comfortable and easy to move in.  at last! ordered as christmas gift my daughter loved these cofortable jammies the leggings arrived sooner than i thought they would. they are really cute but high waisted. i still love ove them. the only thing i didn\\'t like was the &#34;stitching&#34; . it is yellowy green, but not to noticable. also, when i pulled it out of the package there is a random white 5 inch line in the butt lol. but overall they are super cute! color fades fast. cute item and my daughter loves them.  these were a little big but will probably shrink a little because they are 100% cotton. a bit baggy, but i actually like them like that.  quite comfortable.  a good product for the price my wife loves these pants but they are already starting to fade.  we just wash them with all the other laundry so it may be our fault. i really like these,but they run way big,i am size 13/14 these 14\\'s are more like 17/18.i am sending them back and trying the 12\\'s will update after i get them again.i really like the feel and look of these,just hoping that the 12\\'s fit me.....fingers crossed!!<br /><br />8-5-13-update-<br />i forgot to come back and update after getting the size 12,they are still too big,but i can at least wear them with a belt luckily i lost weight, they fit great now i received this item a day earlier than expected, witch was really great. when i opened the package i was a little scared because they looked like they would fit my 5 year old, and i am build kinda thick. surprisingly they were extremely stretchy, and really comfortable. i am always fearful my undies will shine through when i bend over, and this wasn\\'t a problem. f.y.i. they look more shiny spandex than anything, but really cute. overall you can\\'t beat the price. i have a happy wife! now she wants all the colors! the pants are beautiful, although the color is probably more like winter wheat, than winter white because the have a beige tone.  they arrived in excellent condition and as expected. however, the size was extremely too small. i did have to return them because of the size, and i am still waiting for the refund to post on my return. love!!! wearing this tunic length dress once a week. comfortable and cute. effortless dressing. i\\'m 5\\'2 150lb and busty, size 12 fits well. very comfortable.  i\\'m a 10-12 and these are snug, not tight.  the bottoms flow beautifully. super soft. good quality material. silky. heavy. comfy waist band. perfect for around the house. they are thinner than i hoped, but for the price they were still a good buy.  love the color light grey, true to what was advertised. i was very satisfied with the white pants, a little to long for me but i hemmed them up a little and bingo everything was o.k.  i could have used a petite short that would have been perfect. runs small or i need skinnier thighs well constructed, hot look but on my short, somewhat stocky frame, the baggy appearance was diminished. appears to be made for the smaller frame, even within the large size spectrum. but everywhere i went, i got many compliments! i wore them with zebra-striped ankle boots that complimented the striped leg on the pant. too cute! a little tight in the waist--but that will stretch. i am going to order more. great product for the price - though runs pretty small these are really super cute and i adore them but they are much smaller than indicated! great quality and they have a bit of stretch to them which is great cause i sure needed it! lots of compliments on them to say the least but i\\'m a us size 8 and the largest size is what i ordered and they are snug! i wanted baggy but they are fine &#34;snug&#34; so, be aware that the sizing is small!! buenos fit properly. these were for my 11 year old daughter.  she loves them. these pants fit great! quick delivery and fit as expected.  you can\\'t go wrong with the lindsey pants from koi.  just wish they had the 3x in tall. they are cute and they fit great.  the look good and feel comfortable as well.  i wouldn\\'t change a thing and would recommend them to others. it\\'s really sexy, comfortable, and smooth. exactly as depicted in the picture, not too short (which was a worry of mine). it was absolutely perfect, but once i tried it on, i tugged a little too hard and there was a small rip in the seam in the middle. it\\'s cute and comfy, but quality could be better! lots of compliments!  very comfortable of course and gives me a maxi skirt look with coverage.  i\\'m so happy for modest yoga pant alternative! i love this pants!  extemely comfortable and flowing.  great for any casual occasion.  perfect for going shopping. fits exactly how i thought it was going too its different and its cool i love my pants i probly should have ordered 2 sizes smaller instead of just 1 size. but the material and fit is amazing!!!! good fit, true to size and color really love these pants, comfortable fit, and nice and stretchy perfect if they were a little closer to true size.  they are very, very thin so if they are even slightly too large you will need to take them in.  wish i wouldn\\'t have purchased 5 pairs before i knew this!!! perfect for summer. really like these!! i like it... it\\'s a little more darker than the pctur but it fits great was a good fit like the pants but the waistband isn\\'t secure its a wide band but it\\'s not sown in place so it flips around. but other then that it\\'s a good fit in a size8 and got medium might be short for really tall people i\\'m 5\\'4 love it wanted these for tkd and they were exactly as advertised. very comfy for class. they were a little long but i hemmed them. shipped super fast and thy fit perfectly! love them! these are pretty and a nice fit. haven\\'t washed them yet though. enjoy the item i have four pairs of these pants and love them. i am 5 foot 3 so i order the ankle length and they are perfect full length for me. love it i like it. it fits really well. the colour is a little lighter than shown in the picture. true to size. i previously bought a pair of hatley p.j.\\'s and loved them.  because i have put on some extra weight i decided to purchase some new ones.  i found these p.j. pants on amazon and ordered them immediately.  i ordered one size larger so i would be comfortable.  i absolutely love these pants.  besides looking nice, they are so comfortable and wash up as expected.  you won\\'t be disappointed with  a pair of hatley cozy p.j.\\'s. the most comfortable pants i\\'ve ever worn! not only that they are superb for sparring and practicing my tai chi gong. very comfortable very comfortable would love to order more. comfortable for pjs but make sure you wear a light colored pair of undies,  it is while. but other than that i like them and am happy so comfy i have them in almost every color and they are great for work! i like the way the pants fit.  they are a little long, but they are very slimming.  they are a little see through, but they are great for yoga around the house. i bought this product for my sister for her birthday because she is in the dental field and needed scrubs we chose size small because we didn\\'t want them to be too big and they fit her well and they also came a day before the earliest they said it would come so that was great and they are a good quality so they are an awesome set of scrubs i bought these as a gift for my friend. they are cotton and i think the price was a little more than these are worth. they are really cute though and not see through. she is 115lb and 5\\'5&#34;, her weight is evenly distributed. i ordered her a small and she said they fit great with the exception that the thighs were a tad bit tight; i think because they are &#34;slimming&#34;. i want to get myself a pair. works great love them!  they are exactly what i wanted for the days i\\'m relaxing in the house.  comfy! these pants are not generally my style, but i took a chance and i could not be happier! if i could wear these everyday, i would! they are so comfortable and spacious. during my yoga practices, i have no problem moving freely and the pants don\\'t ride/rise up because of the elastic around the ankles. i also just wear these pants around the house after work to be comfy and lounge around! i would recommend these pants to anyone who wants to be comfortable and look cute at the same time! they also shipped to me very quickly which is another plus! much longer than i expected, but they can be altered, so that is not a problem. looser than i expected also. i may return for an exchange because i really like the fabric and style. these are a little thin, as other reviewers noted, but they are very comfy. my only issue is that i have to hem them, because i have fairly short legs. i\\'m 5\\'4&#34; and got the large, but they are still 2 inches too long. 😍 nice just what i was looking for! nice, comfortable, light cloth. only one small thing: too transparent for my taste. i have to use a type of lycra or leggings under it, so, not sure of using it during summer but perfect for spring time. delivery time was good these leggings don\\'t disappoint. i have some from last year, they really hold their shape. they run true to size. i am sure i will be buying more. loveeeee them !! they fit perfect, great to workout in but at home. came on the delivery date it was suppose to. i\\'m satisfied with my order (: thank you. really like them , just wished were a little bit longer but overall good buy love the pants, their little snug but they still did that work of compression! i love them nice and soft,  a little long, but will shrink these are wonderful dress-up, dress-down pants.  they work well with heels or with sandals.  i found them very comfortable.  l.k. runs very true to size, so be aware of that when you order your size! (i loved these... they work great for all nine months) very comfortable - long enough.  hey are great. very cute pants, is rather small considering that usually use 4/6 size and bought a m size, really seems leather and does not stretch they are comfortable but not shabby. they have a very nice cut and they are made with good material. a good value. oooooooo so comfy! good quality. material is lightweight. i\\'d handwash though because the fabric has just enough brush to it to pill in the dryer. if you\\'re looking for a cute summer stretchy comfy trouser for an evening out, these are super sweet. very nice, i like it i usually wear a size small (size 2) but bought the medium after reading the reviews. i bought the grey in size 4s. i really like the color and it fits decently well. the straight leg cut is great and not too wide legged like other pants. i am 156 cm tall and the pant length is about 1 inch longer. i\\'ll definitely getting more of these.<br />overall i would definitely recommend it but buy one size up. as other reviewers have stated they do run small. i normally wear a 4 but have recently put on a couple of pounds. i ordered the medium with the outlook of going on a diet and taking the pounds back off. so yes they were a little snug. they were also long but i\\'m only 5\\'4 and these will work great with heels. the pant legs had a nice flare and not to big. they were actually just what i like. the material is also what i like because it\\'s easy to wash and wrinkle free. i am also impressed with the care they took in the packaging. i received this at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. i am very happy with this purchase. i bought these for comfort daily wear that looked great and they are everything i hoped they\\'d be. the fabric is a lightweight soft cotton that washes well and doesn\\'t wrinkle. i\\'d certainly buy more of them if needed. absolutely love the kitten and inverted cross design on the tight. i am a bit small at 5 ft 115 lbs, they fit great in the waist and thigh area but do get a bit baggy at the knees and down which i expected. i plan on wearing these with mid calf length boots and socks so that should alleviate the problem. all in all great quality and very cute. bought as a gift these are awesome pants.  they are hefty in fabric - a little thicker than i expected - but very nice quality for a great price.  i ordered an xl, and i am a curvy size 14 & they were plenty big enough.  the problem (for me) is the length.  they really are 31 inch inseam.  i was hoping i would be surprised by the length (as i so often am - length is rarely recorded accurately on any website).  but these are accurately reported as 31 inches.  that is about 2 inches too short for me, and i was hoping to let the hem out - but there isn\\'t enough hem to work with, or to justify the trouble/ expense.  otherwise - i would give these 5 stars - for anyone shorter than me!  they look just like the photo, i love the fit & flare of the leg.  what a great price too - so sad to send them back!<br /><br />update: i just realized that the length on this brand is reported as 32.5 - that is definitely not the case, these are 31 inch.  wish they wre 32.5, that would have been perfect!  ugh. the pants are very soft and comfortable. i will be purchasing a few  in  other colors! it\\'s good. i love these pants , everywhere i go people ask me where i got them , i teach dance so they are awesome , i love these pants...so comfortable and for the price, it\\'s a good buy.  i\\'m 5\\'4&#34; and they were too long...i\\'ll have to hem them both but no biggie.  one thing i did notice is that they &#34;grew&#34; as i wore them and i found my self pulling at them to keep them up (just a knit band).  maybe i should\\'ve ordered a smaller size?  however, i\\'d rather be a little on the big side rather than the small because it\\'s an easy fix and less hassle than returns.  i\\'ll probably take the waist band up a bit.  overall, nice pants for a great price and if you have to hem them, oh well.  still worth it. medium pant regularly, but i\\'ve been rocking these stretchy suckers into third trimester. very comfortable.  the material is thin, which is perfect for the climate where i live.  if i was expecting this product to keep me warm in cool weather, i would be disappointed. these are great women\\'s ponte pants.  they are true to size, made of quality material, machine washable and extremely comfortable.  on top of all of this, very fashionable. they have nice details regarding the seams on the legs as well as the zippers. being tall, these were also the perfect length.<br /><br />i received this in exchange for my honest review. these are my own true opinions bought for my mom and she loves them.  petite sizing was perfect. these are fun to wear.  i will enjoy the variety they add to my wardrobe.  i bought a medium. i am 5\\'4 1/2&#34; 127 lbs. might get a large next time or possibly tighten the waist elastic so i don\\'t find myself pulling them up frequently. very nice i love it bought for a cosplay costume, but they\\'re already a staple in my wardrobe!<br /><br />(i\\'m the one who slayed cookie monster, not a great picture for the pants though...) overall all i like this product, but it\\'s a little loose in the mid section..i wear them to lounge around at home so i don\\'t mind if they\\'re somewhat large. would have probably fit better if it was just small not small/medium.. fits great! really soft and the pants is more of a coral color. absolutely love them and they\\'re very comfortable!!! these are the ultimate in comfort plus the look is awesome. i\\'m surprised the material is better quality than expected. almost didn\\'t fit my niece i love them but they fit a lil small but need a bigger size if u have a size 24 in woman\\'s that would be great!!! the texter wasn\\'t as i expected. it\\'s more of a spandex like a legging the pants are just as the photos, the design makes the product comfortable to wear and seller is very nice, fast service, everything was fine. recommend.. exactly what i expected, comfortable, doesn\\'t pinch anywhere and flows pleasantly. it is very slightly sheer with light behind you but not so much that i wouldn\\'t wear it in public. not hemmed excellent  quality and great price.  hard to find women\\'s pajamas with pockets!  i am very short so have to hem but that is true of everything i buy i\\'m 5&#34;4 and 125 pounds and these pants fit perfectly. they aren\\'t see through at all and they look just like the photo! i highly recommend this product i bought these in black aztec for a slim 15 year old girl who likes unusual things and mis-matched socks. they\\'re really cute and i\\'m sure she\\'ll like them. also they arrived before expected which was nice. i ordered it a couple days ago and it came in earlier than i expected, and it fits perfectly and the color is beautiful and i absolutely love it and will definitely be buying more! works just as ordered they really looked good and fit as expected. i made a mistake and listened to reviews that said order up a size or two, ended up being wayy too large. should have just stuck with my size.  they look really good and looks super comfy, wish i could have worn them. i never write reviews, but loved these pants so much i thought i would.  they are a good length which is hard for me to find because i am 5\\'2.  i got the medium short.  they are very comfortable.  the waste is a little loose, but they stay up good because of the way they are designed. i bought another pair. i do really like these leggings because they are thick, so they aren\\'t see-through and they are warm enough to stand up to winters in new england! unfortunately, they have pilled quite a lot in the groin area, which is really the only downside. i bought them in a large in black and medium in brown. i\\'m normally an 8-10 in pants, and found that the medium fit my waist a bit better. these fit great! also for the price they aren\\'t too thin and very comfortable. may order a few more pairs as i enjoy wearing them so much! perfect length as well. excellent surprisingly these fit good.. i was a little wary but they turn out to have a starchy waste band and the came with a belt. i wear size 1-3 usually and got a medium great pants, tight but fitting, i wear these to work and everyone likes them, can\\'t tell they are jeggings at all. i ordered these to wear to the gym and they are perfect. i have heavy thighs and often pants are too tight in that area and then my legs tend to tug them downward so the draw string on these pants are great! pant were a bit long but that\\'s ok with me. other than that they\\'re really good for the price you pay zenana is my favorite yoga pant(s) i own, so cute and obviously comfy...color doesn\\'t fade either. i love these pants! note the size chart is for girls, not women.  i bought xl and the waist measures 34-36 - but these jeans don\\'t come up waist high so the 34-36 perhaps should be your hip measurement for xl to fit.  i wear women\\'s 14 or 16 pants (36&#34; waist) and i can\\'t even get these xls close to buttoning closed.  they look so good otherwise that i\\'ll keep them and try to lose weight or do an alteration. loved it. loved the material. did not wear as lounging pants. nice enough to wear outside and very comfortable. like them a lot. its comfortable. i can wear to work. wear as casual wear. its thick enough that keeps you warm for cool weather. i bought these as a gift for my sister. she\\'s 110, a bit over 5 feet. they\\'ll fit her just fine, might even be a bit looser than needed in the crotch/tummy area as they looked a bit big there but nothing bad. she\\'s very thin with big butt and hips, they will fit fine. just for reference what i eyeballed. the colors were intense, upon first glance i didn\\'t even think they were correct but yes. correct. very very thin material but what can you expect with 98 polyester. they\\'re sexy, they\\'ll do. i am sure anyone under 150 can wear them. love these! great fit, not too thin or sheer. they\\'re a bit long but at 5\\'5&#34; i\\'m used to that. it\\'s an easy hemming fix. perfect comfortable!  i am 5\\'4 and they are a little long. i would not wear this unless you had a long shirt to cover you b*** because this is more like a very thick pantyhose good fit. great activewear. would buy again. sizing is as expected. i am 5\\'11&#34; and i wear a size 10.  the large fits me perfectly and are long enough.  they aren\\'t stretched thin enough to see through on me.  they fit very snug and comfortably.  i\\'ll be ordering more. nice fit i am soooo in love with these pants! absolutely perfect! material is somewhat thin good fit and not to tight, daughter used them two or three times and they seem to be holding together so far. i love these pants but i have to say i\\'m still laughing after opening them.  see i didn\\'t see that they had skulls along with the flowers on them.  my grandkids are going to think they\\'re nana has lost it.  to funny. very comfortable. fit very nicely. going to be great for hiking. my daughter thought these pants, out of all her yoga pants, have the best fit and feel!  the company was diligent about resolving a small issue that we had, without question sent another order!  everything was fantastic.  i couldn\\'t recommend a company any higher than this one.  completely satisfied customer! these pants are a great look for any occasion !!! purchase them for a concert the look is fab legs fit a little tight and doesn\\'t really give too much it worked for me because i have small l calves but not for thick ones this pant is perfect, both the type of fabric, composition and quite comfortable and fit perfect. the size is complete. wish i would have sized down...they fir rather large, i ordered these in two colors and sizes, black large, and red medium because the reviews on the size had me worried. they both fit but the large was much easier to slide over my legs. the fabric does stretch!- not as much as tights do but they definitely do stretch. but because i work out a lot my legs are a little muscular so the large does feel better. i had to pull a little on the medium to get it up. i haven\\'t danced in these yet, just got them yesterday and tried them on.  if your debating on the size, go up a size, they won\\'t fall down.  i\\'m buying a bunch of contrasting colored microfiber tights to wear underneath them. this is going to be fun! i also think the tights will allow the pants to slide on easier.    all in all i\\'m happy with this purchase and would buy these again.    the four stars is because of the tag, grrrrr. it\\'s between the lace and the shorts so it\\'s visible, bright white. i was able to cut it off but now i have a hard time telling the front from the back. great fit just as i expected i love the pants. they are soft and comfortable. they can be dressed up or used just as a casual outfit. size l a little small. it really is like a size m . otherwise fine. i was worried about the sizing of this item, but the look was what i was wanting. the description gave the measurements, so it was just a matter of squeezing my hips into them, which they did! they\\'re super tight, but i do look super good in them. they also shipped fast. these pants are very comfy and fit well. a little high waisted and more flair than boot cut, but i like that. however sizing is hit or miss with \\\\\\\\\"woman within\\\\\\\\\" though.  i am a 2x, size 22, have been for years. ww 2x peasant top is huge on me, but ww bathing suit 24 is tight.  according to sizing info chart for plus sizes by my measurements i should order a 3x (22/24), but this product has specific sizing under product description. 1x(22w-24w), 2x(26w-28w), 3x(30w-32w). so i should order a 1x, right?  after reading every product review i could find on pants from woman within i decided to split the difference and got a 2x. i got lucky, they fit perfect. just a tad too long, i\\'m 5\\'7\\\\\\\\\". can\\'t complain, i got them in violet for only $12.99 and free shipping because i ordered some other items. love these pants i need to order more it\\'s like yoga pants only they are actually pants great for work in my office i like it too much fit as expected. should have got a med but they didn\\'t have them in stock. still comfy for lounging have several colors in these. waist band fits perfect without muffin top effect. one note: seemed to go through bad batch. received 2 in one shipment with pinhole. as usual, amazon was fabulous about the return. perfect with tunics - holds everything in place with no lumps or bumps showing. i\\'m 5\\'9 and they easily come to my ankles. expensive, but have not found this quality elsewhere. these are sweet!  though they are knit.  even washed beautifully and did not shrink. cargo pocket on these pants is too wide and hangs open, making it useless for anything but lightweight items such as notes or alchohol swabs. buy them a size up. if you buy it 00 as xs small not because the idea is that they are not as licras holgaditos. it\\'s good quality and look very pretty! i love this scrub set it fits me beyond than what i expected as an nurse. i love the length i am 5\\'9 the material of it is very nice and i will be ordering again i love this scrub set great quality. i have heard the brand and it does not dissapoint great fit just kinda thin. havent washed them much and feel like they wont last very long. very comfortable!!! i would like another pair if i thought they would last! somewhat small for me, and it is hard to get use to strips, but all in all very nice. washed up great and keeps a starched texture. i did remove the buttons, as i planned to wear them with a long tunic and didn\\'t need more bulk. when i first was ordering this i didnt look too much into the details and specifications,  so when i bought it,  i thought it was a mini dress, but im actually glad its a jumpsuit because it is really short, but i absolutely love it!! its so adorable and comfortable and i love wearing mine with pantyhose or just as is.. and the straps actually come off so you can wear it criss-crossed or straight, which i also love.<br /><br />(side note: the little balls of puff at the end do tangle up, so i only wash, and then i hang dry it.) i love these and plan to buy more. i\\'m 5\\'1&#34; and 120 lbs, ordered medium and they fit perfectly. the color did fade a little bit but nothing major. ordered for my daughter who just had knee surgery and uses them for physical therapy. real comfortable i did receive the right product,  t shirt material, but cute. its nice you don\\'t see the sweat they are very nice, but i ordered a wrong size by a mistake...had to send them back . simply too good! i was pleased with this product.  they are a little large, which is what i wanted. love them pricey compared to what\\'s on sale locally, but i wanted the ww theme for a relative for christmas and didn\\'t find that locally.  nice plush fleece though.  she\\'s gonna love these. i normally wear a 3-5 in juniors and the small fit me perfectly. very good quality and inner lining is soft and comfortable on the skin. i was actually surprised by how thick the pants are; my legs will definitely stay warm when i\\'m outside. the sequence is not super shiny and has more of a subtle sheen to it, but shines when you walk as the light hits the pants. i\\'m sure in pictures (when the flash is activated) they\\'re very shiny and pretty. also, extremely fast shipping - came a week earlier than expected! love love these pants. they fit perfect. i wear a 16 in jeans so i got a 2x and they are perfect. they are not see through like most pants this style. be careful though because i ordered 2 other pair and 1 was too tight and the other was completely see through. i bought these for my daughter and she wears a size 3 i had to but a large! fits great but i had to cut out a button hole! love these! fit as expected, super soft and organic!! woot woot! i really love bend over slacks and have not had any for many years. when i found these and ordered them in my regular size i was disappointed to find they ran small. i don\\'t remember them being like that when i wore them long ago. it seems they ran true to size then. i will either give them away or hold on to them as perhaps they will fit if my diet works!! they arrived in a timely manner and well packaged and i would recommend but be sure to check the sizing very carefully. i do a lot of exercises...i was satisfy from the pans the lounge pants are lightweight yet warm. the fabric is smooth and comfy. they wash and dry well. great product. i absolutely love these pants! they are comfortable, well cut and flattering to the figure. i am very tall though and wish they were just a little bit longer by a half inch or inch. very nice pants.  i really love it!! thanks! finally a maternity pant for tall people!  one of my biggest problems is finding maternity pants long enough for me, i\\'m 5\\'8 and not only are they long enough but they are very comfortable only wish they came in more colors. i love these pants! they have a nice pattern and fabric, fully functional cargo pockets and fit very nicely..except at the crotch area. there was an inch or two of space at the crotch area.  for reference, i usually wear a size five or size 27 at forever 21. my hips are 34 inches and my waist is 27 inches and i got the size small in olive.<br />i plan to shrink them a bit in the washer, and use my sewing skills to make it fit better. but for the price, these are great! these pants are so nice.  the elephant pattern on the legs is matched up and they are made well.  i got the drawstring style and prefer it to the smocked.  i\\'m 5\\'2 and size 6 and these fit very nicely.  the length isn\\'t a problem because of the elastic in the legs.  definitely a good buy. i orderded this outfit not to long ago and the arrival date was jul. 20-aug. 5 and i received it on july 8. it fits great (ordered normal size) and i like it. :) there are some irregularities in the construction of these capris. it isn\\'t very noticeable.  otheerwise they are fine. the color is nice, and the buttons a little tight to wear as maternity pants love them! way too see through. i wear them as lounge pants with a long shirt. totally comfy tho! get a bigger size, runs small. these pants are so comfortable! i was amazed by the quality and comfort of the pants for the price. i keep coming back and buying them in different colors. they fit great, look great and are so comfortable to work out in or to just lounge around the house! i highly recommend. perfect fit great pants! love the colors and the flow of the material.  i usually wear an 8/10 and the medium fits very well. i love it. came before time and fits and looks perfect exactly like the picture. as the other review said, perfect with boots these are flippin awesome :) a little tight in the waist, but nothing to cry over. they actually  fit a whole lot better than i expected. so happy with this purchase.  would purchase again in the future. but everything is too large for me.  hot wash and dry will fix it right up the colors and style is gorgeous. if you have any doubts about ordering them.....  just do it!! you will not regret it.  i am 5\\'2&#34; and 198lbs, they fit me with a lot of my thigh exposed. which is what i wanted for the beach.  if you are slightly smaller than that i\\'m sure they will close (wrap) further in.  the feel of the fabric is so soft next to my skin. the reverse sides are just as beautiful as the main side.  the seller seems to be really concerned with how you like the products as i got a card in the package that thanked me for my order and also said for any issues contact them directly.  i also paid a little extra (like six bucks) for expedited shipping, it arrived in 2 days!!  really. two days!  i\\'m am thoroughly satisfied. very happy with them. seller delivered quickly was very satisfied. they were heavy duty, fit the way i expected and would re-order. the pockets were some what shallow, but i didn\\'t mind that. the denim was rich in color and hasn\\'t faded as of yet. they are perfect fit along the waist.  the legs are actually comfortably snug. it was an unexpected surprise.  i do yoga in leggings they stretched and fit fine and did not droop. i am 5\\'3 muscular legs they fit perfectly. these pants fit perfectly!  listen to the other reviews when choosing a size, it does run small.<br />these are a great pair of pants to wear dressed down or up!  plus they\\'re extremely comfortable. i do love the look and feel of these pants. although, they fit a tad snug in the waist area, i will still keep these. it was my fault ordering a size 16. i would have fit more comfortable in a size 18. these pants were true to size, not oversized like some plus size clothing companies. but as i said, i will be keeping these and call them my &#34;new goal to weight loss&#34; pants. this is the best carpi pant on the market.  i love all the details on the pair.  i bought the black one and i really like it.  i\\'m planning to buy more colors. lysse is perfect and confortable great i am blown away at the quality of these pants!  the fit is perfect!  the fabric is thick and sturdy and look even better in person!  i hughly recommend buying from ella! so comfy!<br />ahhhhhh. these are my new favorite pants. i wish they had other colors because i\\'d buy them all love these  pants and nicely  made love them love these. they slip a little bit, but fit around waist and thights. i love the pocket - i can put my house key in it and poop bags when i take the dog for a walk. so much easier than trying to hold onto that stuff if i feel like jogging with her. fit great and are comfy not as small as they appear . however satisfied with shipping will be getting them fitted they are cute, but fit a lil small. i would say order a size up then your usual size, other then that cute and material is good. great quality at a great price. really nice . very long, that\\'s perfect for me. i received lots of compliments. cute design, very comfortable, good material, good for exercise and dress up<br />i will recommend this product to my students and friends met my expectation. this product and seller is recommended. i love these:  they are a worthy heir to coldwater creek, since it went bankrupt--with one exception.  you have to reinforce the crotch seams; this is really stretchy fabric, but the seams are not. the fabric is good enough that it\\'s worth the extra twenty minutes with a needle and thread to avoid any embarrassing tears. these are so soft and cozy. i certainly recommend!! when i recieved these the size listed on line was different then what i thought i was getting. i should have measured because they sold them differently than say size 16 or size 8. these pants fit like a dream! they make me look easily 5-10 pounds thinner! and they are incredibly comfortable.  the only complaint i have is that they wrinkle kind of easily, but that might because of the type of material.  then again, if it was a different material, it might not fit as good.  argh! such a catch-22. anyway, i love these pants &amp; i so wish they came in different colors. good product. girlfriend wore them twice since i bought them a month ago for her and thinks they are precious... comfortable to wear only is small size still a little big to me.wish they have xtra small size. this company was very good about making sure i got my product.  the pants fit nice and are very comfortable when riding a bike.  the price was excellent!!! i would recommend this product and the company that sells it. love love love love love love them so comfortable coming from someone who models but still be careful cause they may not be your size im very tiny this is the second pair i buy, and i love it. love them comfy and stylish scrub pants. they fit loose which is great when you bend, twist and squat all day at work. they are a little see through so be careful what underwear you wear with them. im 243 pounds and the x-large fit me fine it\\'s great! love them i love these pants and even wear them during the summer when i\\'m in doors because i get chilled easily at night.  i wear them to the gym all the time to help with extra sweating off of the pounds! fun i bought the red skirt and this palazzo pant. it is a beautiful vibrant color, well made and confortable.  just make sure you realize it\\'s not of a petite frame 5\\'4&#34; and under.  i am short so i had to alter them, but other than that, i love them! good fit i love the design and bright color of these leggings! shipping was fast. i received my order about two weeks before the earliest estimated delivery date. i do imagine i\\'ll be buying even more designs soon, and i will definitely be recommending these to friends and dance/fitness students. daughter loves them! soft, good quality, comfy. i really love these pants...very form fitting and really comfortable, i would love to have every color... would purchase again... i am 5\\'2&#34; tall and these fall mid calf on me. they look very professional and i get a lot of compliments on them at work. i normally wear a size 10 and i purchased these in a medium and they fit well. terrifically soft and comfy. these pants have a nice cut, slightly slimmer through the thigh, then wider to the ankle. the fabric is lightweight, perfect for travel, and doesn\\'t seem to wrinkle much. the waist band is wide and high and can easily be folded down, but i find it very comfortable as is. i bought 3 pairs and i highly recommend these easy, breezy pants. i bought the wrong size, but i love them k i did purchase a 2 sizes down.  wish the color was more vibrante.  but wonderful fit! once you wash, do not dry on the color really fades. love these pants, so comfortable! i have been looking for yoga dress pants for a while and these are more affordable ones. they look very formal but are very comfortable to me. the only thing is, when i just received them, they are like a whole size up. i mistakenly washed them in tumble dry with high heat, they suddenly shrank to just perfect to me. i don\\'t know if it\\'s good or bad, it works for me now, but it does take a star away. very comfortable.<br />follow washing directions to avoid shrinkage. they were for my wife looking good !! fabulous pants, comfy like pjs, i was worried would be too long as i am just under 5 \\'1&#34; but with wedge slides the length is perfect, also love the<br />fold over waist, just hike it up a bit and that helps with the length--also the price is right compared with other offerings on amazon---i wanted to order the grey but they are out of the size medium---i will keep checking! i love these pants i want to buy so many more. these pants are very warm and comfortable. i ordered a large because i read a review about them being a bit short. i am 5\\'10&#34; 160lbs and they are very loose and fall down easily. i wanted them to be tight but wasn\\'t willing to risk getting a pair that were too short, so i knew the chance i was taking before buying. however, they\\'re good quality and i just tie a fabric belt around my waist to hold them up during ballet and it works out great. love this pants they are very comfortable the legs is a little wide on button but that\\'s no biggy i fix it .... fits well, little loose in the waist but then again i\\'m small. love the color contrast. i will order more ! nice thickness for warm or cool days. can be dressed up or down. i\\'m very fat so i need comfort as much or more than style. thank goodness these pants satisfy both! really comfortable and casual. the material is like a thinner version of a yoga pant — would\\'ve liked them to be a just a bit thicker. i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; (got an xl, curvy in butt and thighs) and find them to be on the shorter side. they just barely hit the ground, so i they\\'d look even shorter with any heel. they\\'ll be great for casual summer days though, and would even be great for yoga class...or sleeping ;). i like the pants, fit as expected very nice these are great pants for lounging around.  they are more attractive than yoga pants but just as comfortable.  i love all of the color options. excellent product, prompt delivery its a little tight even when i ordered one size up so orde them biger but the product looks good feels great and i love them i love these yoga pants!! i have bought a few pairs of these pants in different colors because i like them so much! so comfortable!! when i first pulled them out of the package i was disappointed. they have similar material to yoga pants so thought they would look too casual.  once on they are more dressy than i would have thought and because they have yoga pant material they are super comfortable they are kind of thin so black panties at all times ladies. they are the type that can catch a snag. i am 5ft 1in they are really long. these run a little on the smaller side. go one size up when ordering. very cute. cute and good quality, but too small. these pants are great for lounging around the house. personally i wouldn\\'t wear them out in public unless i have a long t-shirt or sweater on because they are really thin and can if you bend over they are see through. also they are long. granted, i\\'m 4\\'11\\'\\' so all pants are long on me, but these are to the extreme. be aware if you are on the shorter side you will need to get these hemmed. overall great comfy pants to wear around the house. surprisingly it fit perfectly. for a small. it was my birthday outfit they loved it. it is difficult to find a pair of long yoga pants. i wanted them to touch the floor when i\\'m barefooted. i\\'m 5\\'8&#34; and these do just that! i liked them so much that i ordered more. i got the large (i typically wear a 12 in pants). plenty of stretch in these! considering getting more because they are more lightweight than the other yoga pants i have. they\\'ll be comfortable even in warmer weather. i wore them on a recent cruise to the caribbean (75-85 degrees). windy nights made these absolutely perfect. no pockets to bulk them up. no silly, colorful bands around the waist. no distracting lines. no annoying drawstrings. love them.<br />oh, some mentioned that they are too thin to wear in public. i didn\\'t find that to be the case. they\\'re fitting, definitely. i got the black and navy. as long as i don\\'t wear white underwear i don\\'t think you could ever notice anything. if you\\'re wearing bikini/briefs, you will see lines because they fit your form, but a thong should not be noticable. in any event, it has not been an issue for me. perhaps it is different for lighter colors. i cannot speak to that. i am 5.91/2 and about 130 lbs and purchased the black in size 5/6.  most of the time i order women\\'s jeans in size 4, but i knew that going up a size would be better because the pants are listed as junior sizing.<br />they fit perfect in my waist and length!<br />sometimes i worry when ordering black jeans because they look faded black. these jeans from touch me have a rich dark hue which pleases me.<br />the pink one\\'s listed are calling my name, thinking about purchasing those as well:)<br />i received this item for a slight discount for an honest review.  these are nice quality pants for the price listed and are worth testing out!<br />just remember to order up a size or two, if you are used to ordering women\\'s sized jeans... these shorts are great. they are very cute and stylish but still fit very comfortably. these striped pants fit really good, and look good on. i like the material, and the striped look is so cute.<br />delivery was good, again a happy customer. one size fits all but would say, one should be on the smaller<br />side to wear these striped pants.  i am small and they fit me good. so again i would say these one size  capris are for the smaller woman. jaleeagnes sl this is the style for me. i need to hide my thighs so the wide leg is not too tight on that area that i need help. it is perfect for any occasion. great price! thank you! i usually wear a small, but after readign reviews ordered a medium.. im glad i did, these are soooo cute, ordered two more colors.. staple to ny wardrobe.. dressed up or down, theyre comfortable but still form fitting and sexy liked very much these fit a bit small but would consider buying them again. bought this for my 14 year old daughter who is 4\\'11&#34;. fits her perfectly. she loves it the fit is good.  the color was just right and they washed and dried great, too! i loved these.  previously i have had the \\\\\\\\\"suspender\\\\\\\\\" type pant holders that clip on the bottom of your pants and the elastic part ran under your foot.  but after a while the clips would irritate my ankles.  this design however was completely comfortable, easy to put on, and held my jeans in place under boots all day without the hated \\\\\\\\\"bunching at the knees.\\\\\\\\\"  they did exactly what i needed them to do. they run a bit small-- but are very comfortable and look great- thick enough material--so i cna move in them, but not feel exposed:&#62;) i am 5\\'6\\\\\\\\\" and wear a size 14 and a large is plenty big enough. they do have an elastic drawstring so you can tighten them slightly. they held up very well; i went skiing in them. i recommend them if you just want some basic snow pants for a good price. excellent love them! looks very good and fits me well fit pretty true to size. wash up very well. very soft comfortable flannel. warm but not too warm like fleece bottoms. i love them i have brought many styles of these pants and i love them all. the 70\\'s feel and look to them are just great. get lots of compliments on them. ordered next size up and fit fine comfy pajama pants! 👌 love the feel of the fabric and the fit! i won\\'t buy any other brand of scrubs! i loved the first 2 pr. they fit perfect, but this pr was a size to small. i returned them for a larger size 3x and was told they smelled of smoke and i do not smoke !!!! so i not only didn\\'t get the larger size they haven\\'t even returned the 2x !!  i am so disappointed because i love the first 2 pr. of pants so much ! very unique design.  i love them and they are comfortable.  can dress them up or wear casual. glam!! summer soft fabric and fit nicely. highly recommend, great pant, good quality and fast service. have ordered many items from this company and will continue to do so. good fit. easy to wear.  comfy, for the price, i am satisfied.  i have some concern for how long the product will last with wear, but considering the cost, i don\\'t have high expectations. gave these to my daughter for christmas. she thinks they are great! beautiful material! just a little larger than expected, which is normal for me. i am pnly five feet tall. love them but cut small so they don\\'t fit. my daughter loves them though delivered promptly great packaging not for bigger ladies fit is excellent, good muscle support. nice color and quality. came sooner than expected. i will buy more from this seller they fit perfect. fit well. very funky pants........ very comfortable and elegant i have been searching high and low for some olive green linen pants and these finally it the bill! sz xs, 5\\'3, 105 lb. they are a tad long but work perfectly for wedges and look cute rolled up too. they do have a shorter &#34;crotch&#34; (hate that word) area but i wear my pants low so it doesn\\'t bother me. bazaar pants so comfortable, looks great on, a little long but im tall so i like that. get compliments everytime i wear them loved them they fit as expected got a size large. love them!  perfect fit, beautiful pattern. love these. perfect for long legs. so comfy! love these this pants are so so comfortable.  i love the pockets. the material is very soft and thin (which i like). great for around the house+ exercise. they dont fall down. the elastic on the waist area is strong. their fun! love them, fit perfect however one pair came with a small part of the inseam not stiched wanted some straight leg velvet pants, these fit the bill.  hard to find petite holiday wear, these have a flat front and elastic back, which looks very nice. i am 5\\'7 and ordered a small....but these pants were long even on me. otherwise they fit great and they are very comfortable. great vibrant color comes with stretch so u get a firm fit... its overall very cute and runs true to size!! they were a bit long before washing but after they are perfect length. i love them. very nice this was a last minute purchase for an even where our team had to match and i was the only one without black capri pants. they arrived sooner than expected, and fit perfectly. ordering plus sized clothing online can be tricky but i was very pleased. comfortable great pants love these pants.. i even use them for yoga practice. i luv them! they are very comfortable and they are becoming/nice looking on me, at least that is what my husband says!  thank you! its darker than it looks in the picture but i still like them! got in a size 16 and they fit perfect! this is perfect if you don\\'t want expend to much money. it fit good, i got it on time and i love it! how i love this baggy pants, this is my first time to wear this type of pants and it fits great and looks very interesting. the fabric is excellent. just remember this are not us sizes. i had to order a 2xl. i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; , i normally wear a size 29 to 30 waist. these are 2xl (32 waist) so a little big in the waist for me but they do not stretch. i get compliments all the time on these pants. they feel great on. hope this helps. wears great.  total comfort and style.  i can pair with sneakers flip flops or heals and go anywhere in these pants! very cute good ;) granddaughter loves it ! i am 160 pounds and they fit great i ordered a larger they feel a little big around my waist but other then that they fit perfect . im a 5ft girl and i wear a size 0-1 in jeans. i bought a medium cause everyone said it runs small. it fits me perfectly! they are very comfortable but there also very thin. they are see through so you cant wear bright color underwear underneath them. they kinda remind me of sexy sweat pants. i love them very much and going to buy more in different colors. my 25 years old daughter loves them, just what i wanted. great item. fast shipping!!!! fit is perfect. surprise surprise  , i expected to hem them. i am 4\\' 10&#34; - - length is perfect, don\\'t need to hem. i bought black. have only washed one time , so i don\\'t know if the color will stay or not. if color does not fade after 10 washings then i will buy more.<br />one nice thing, the pockets are deep enough to safely hold my cell phone , with no worry of it falling out. they shrunk tremendously when washed!!! i bought these for my daughter, currently a college student.  the price was great, and the quality is very good.  i bought two more pairs for her in the other color set since the first set was so terrific.  my only issue is that more and more, amazon shipments are not including a packing slip, and i like to have the paperwork to document my transactions.  however, i would purchase this product again because of the price and quality. i used the measuring guide and thought the xl would be too big, instead they are fairly loose.  could have easily used the large.  other than that, they are nice.  keep in mind, they are underwear.  you will want to wear something over them. these cute pj\\'s are adorable.  soft, very soft.  they were a gift and my daughter in love loved them and they fit perfectly. i like it, is nice design and soft is the same like a picture they washed nicely  and i will roll up the legs, since i am short, but i love them.  i would recommend them. they fit perfect especially if you are curvy. couldn\\'t be happier!!! i\\'m ocd about my yoga pants. i\\'m 5\\'6 and have long legs always have a hard time finding yoga pants that are long enough. my favorite pair bit the dust and i took a chance on these and couldn\\'t be happier fit perfect in every way!! i bought this pants for a camping. it\\'s a great quality pants for the price. the adjustable tie at inside of the waist made it easy if you want to buy a slight bigger size. i am a size medium and i ordered this leggings in a size large because according to the reviews they run small. i tried them on and the were just perfect.they look very nice. they\\'re very comfortable. do you know if plus sizes will be available in isaac mizrahi clothing? i love this romper. the material is so comfortable and thick enough that you don\\'t need anything underneath. the v-neck is somewhat revealing but on nights when i want to show off the girls, this is perfect. but i wear this romper on lazy days and going out. the straps in the back are nice but i put a black thick belt around the belt-ish part and i\\'m good to go. the pockets are awesome too! love this and if you are questioning the quality, don\\'t! it\\'s one of my favorite purchases from allegra k! i received these 7 days after i ordered them to a rural city in ca. i like them! they\\'re soft, light enough for hanging out in the desert summer evenings and the colors are gorgeous. i\\'m 5\\'4 normally 8/10 carrying most of it in my waist and hips and they fit fine for me, they come just above the top of my feet when tied at my natural waist. i would deffently recamend these to any one, from the skinny minnie\\'s to the jr. plus, they fit realy good, and has just the right amount of breathable space looks like expected, unless you are very very tall  very very short. grip at ankles is a bit itchy, but all else fine. price was good. fit a little small, but length was perfect. so comfy! i love these pants and will be wearing them after the baby is born. they are very thin, though. but holding up well. it fits as expected, not too tight not too loose. just wright. the fabric looks amazing and the color is just beautiful of good quality so far. loved em definitely awesome super comfy! had to exchange - very cute printe love it! just perfect! actually better than expected, no one will know waist band, would recommend! i love these leggings.  very warm!  i am 5\\'4&#34; and 120 lbs and these leggings fit perfectly - snug in the waist so they don\\'t slide down like some of those &#34;one size fits all&#34; and just the right length.  several reviewers commented on the length but these were just right for me! these are really nice pants.  they are not too light or heavy in fabric.  just right.  nice for gym or just going out to shop. good buy put pants run a little small is perfect the fabric the style all, the fabric is very alike to the fabric nike use in its sport outfits i ordered these pants expecting them to be too big, or fit strangely, but they fit perfectly! i followed their sizing chart and it\\'s pretty much exact, i would recommend following it if you don\\'t know what size to get. the pants themselves are super soft and comfortable, and even come with pockets, which i didn\\'t know, so that was a surprise! i would definitely order pants from this seller again, and i usually hate ordering pants online. but now i know what i\\'m getting! i love the style of these pants! i have some junk in my trunk so went up a size because thats what others suggested......i shouldve stuck with my normal size or maybe even a size smaller. larger than expected very nice, but they\\'re more like panties and i wouldn\\'t wear them outside my clothes. these pants are great. fabric is stretch and quick thick. colors are so vibrant. the fit is great as well. they are suitable and comfortable. wash them separately with cold water. i love them! i am going to order more.<br />they are very form fitting, and the cut looks cute. i ordered a size small. i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; and 108lb. it fits great. i own these in both magenta and black and i wear them all the time. they\\'re comfortable on the waist (they don\\'t cut in like jeans can) and they\\'re form fitting. the material is like cotton/jersey material -- no sheen or spandex look and not denim. not see-through either. i wouldn\\'t go as far to say they\\'re stretchy but they have a bit of give to them. they\\'re a little long for my legs so there is a bit of gather at the ankle. i wish there were more colors. i would totally go for a bright teal or coral. a bit tight. i hover between 10 and 12 and am 5\\'8&#34; tall. i can get away with mediums most of the time. they fit okay, just kind of too tight for stretchy loose pants. they look and feel good. very good quality. fits well and looks nice. stylish pants very comfortable but a little too long they almost drags on the floor i had to take them in but nice love them!! great navy color to pair up with white top!! they are a very nice fit and long enough to wear with high heels. i wish they were sold in other colors just perfect awesome! these pants are amazing! i wish we could get more just like them!!! great scrubs i have every color i love these . very comfortable but a little see threw. at school you can\\'t wear leggings unless it covers your bum i\\'ve never had a problem but it shows through lot more than expected . i needed to change :-( either way i have a hard time trying to find a long shirt that would match this . anyone have ideas that would help :d i like my pants, used them several times now and stayed warm. i am a paddleboarder on the washington coast.  the conditions were clear, dry and sunny about 48 degrees, i fell coming in and still didn\\'t get cold while packing up and traveling home.<br /><br />i did think they were too small at first but at 5\\' 3 132lb the large would be too big so after a little time they have stretched, still fit snug but not uncomfortable. they have a soft lining and flat seams, no chafing so far.<br /> i paired these with  a neoprene hoodie from hyperflex and love this combo instead of a full wetsuit. will keep my review updated this winter. paddle on! love these.  super cute and comfy!  many compliments.  i am 5\\'8&#34; 125lbs and they fit me perfectly.  think i\\'ll order another pair! so comfortable!!! first i will say i was pleasantly surprised by the weight of the fabric! it\\'s a perfect balance of a linen but a durable linen that isn\\'t sheer. the medium fit me perfectly with my hip measurement of 39&#34; (inches) and waistband has nice drawstring for smaller waist. i was nervous about the pockets because commonly with bigger hips and smaller waist the pockets stick out awkwardly but not with these pants! the length is a bit long about an inch too long for my height 5\\'4&#34;. true to size. very soft, and high quality. i will definitely be ordering more colors in the near future, as i am totally pleased with my purchase. i just purchased 2 pair of isaac\\'s jeans and they are the best and most confortable jeans i have ever worn.    am looking forward to more of his items i like the color; it is true to the picture. then this is the first cargo pant that has pockets deep enough to fit my phone (samsung galaxy note 3) and there are six of them. the only think i do not like is that the finishing is poor: there are a lot of threads that need to be cut short. i will order more. love these pants!  they are comfortable and fit great.  i plan on ordering another pair or two - i got a medium and i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; and usually wear a size 6.  they are perfect and i\\'m pleased with the quality. it has amazing textures. with beautiful designs to the side of the jeans. comfortable to wear and looks good in public. pants are super comfortable but look very nice and are cool in heat i am bottom heavy and i ordered a large, they fit great and look nice too it\\'s a little short on the waist but nothing i can\\'t handle. i love the feel of the material. it fits me well even with my big booty for an asian girl. would recommend to everyone! the closed pockets in the back are essential for me so that i don\\'t lose any on my personal stuff. the many pockets are crucial as i can\\'t bring a purse to clinical. the self hemming pants is an extra amazing feature. i am planning on getting more so that i can wear them everyday. they don\\'t look like regular scrubs. love these pants! very comfortable and i love the fabric. these are awesome leggings and are very comfortable. love these pants. they are a little too long and i\\'m 5\\'7&#34; even with wedge sandals. great fit and comfy. love these! i\\'m not a high wasted shorts/pants girl but i needed then for work.  they fit really nice.  only problem i had was the material is smooth so they would slide up my thighs occasionally - which is the only reason i didn\\'t give it 5 stars.  they\\'re not too tight. super stretchy and comfy.  i would recommend these to anyone.  didn\\'t have a problem with camel toe either :) i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; about 130lbs athletic build.  i usually wear size 4 sometimes 6 depending on the material.  i ordered a medium and they fit perfect.  not too tight not loose or too big.  i have a little bit of a butt and my thighs aren\\'t small. so if you are skinny legged and don\\'t have much of a butt go with a small. really nice pair of white pants. fits great! love them, just perfect! got them in all colors :) i love these pants. they are great for lounging, yoga, pilates, barre, any form of exercising (even housework). just do not, repeat do not, wear them outside the house. you can even wear them as pajamas and please don\\'t be caught wearing them in public, not even the supermarket!!!!! lol these panties are soft, comfortable, fit well, and wash beautifully.  i would recommend them for anyone who wants the silky feel yet very durable panty. receive them, tried them on , will be buying more,  just get one size down and you will love them too my only (minor) complaint on the fit is in the back-waist.  seems to be cut for slightly flat-bottomed women, as fold-over waist tends to really dip down in the back.  since i wear these as lounge/pajama bottoms, it\\'s no big deal, but doesn\\'t have a smooth &#34;line&#34; on the backside.  otherwise, super comfortable, stretchy and a pretty flattering fit! absolutely love these pants! thank you! i love these pants! so cute. they are thin. i do not recommend machine washing. was by hand only and dry flat. they are very comfortable to wear. pants run long, fit great. nice for $6.<br />however please not these are not really yoga pants like mentionned in the title.<br />it is really pajamas pants!<br /><br />quality is not very good, but for $6, good enough.<br />it is light and not too warm (which i like).<br /><br />they run rather large, but it is comfortable to sleep with.<br />length was great (i\\'m 5\\'2) but i wear them above my belly button :) the price was right, looks good, fits great and are very comfortable. i live almost 100 miles from a decent store to buy reasonably priced items - so this was great. just what i wanted. she loves the suit. love jockey scrubs! it\\'s tight, light and comfortable. just right for yoga exercise! no hole for button. these are comfy, good looking pants in a soft fleece material. i was worried they\\'d be too warm, but they\\'re fine (although i don\\'t think i\\'d wear them in the summer). they do run long, but with shoes on they\\'re fine. the elastic waist is no too tight. i would certainly order these again. just found this brand and already i love it. the print is so cute and funny. i will, for sure, be getting more of the pj bottoms.<br />highly recommended. ugly as sin but my daughter loves em, ordered em for her so that is whats important these pants are great. i have been eyeing them for years, and i\\'m really happy to finally have a pair. i never had the guts to order them before because i knew returning them would be a complete nightmare if they didn\\'t fit. i ordered two sizes larger as many reviewers suggested, but i wish i had only ordered one size up. the only places i ever buy pants from are hollister (size 00-0/size 23-24) abercrombie and fitch (size 00/size 24). i\\'m just a little under 5\\'4 in height, and weigh 112lbs. i ordered a medium(us size 4) and they are a little too big in the waist. they definitely require a belt to keep them from sagging. i have absolutely no complaints about these pants. they\\'re very well made, the material is pretty heavy-duty, and i think they\\'ll hold up quite nicely throughout years of hiking/backpacking. my 11 month old daughter has been enjoying playing with the ties at the bottom, and my husband thinks they look great. i will definitely be purchasing more. i ordered the camouflage pair, and absolutely recommend them. i\\'m 5\\'3&#34;  110 lbs. and wish i would have bought a small. it\\'s very stretchy ( medium was too big)<br />i purchased 2 and prefer one over the other because the pattern is more pleasing.  ( big circle in center of butt!!) i love those leggings they are nice and fit perfectly perfect these are my favorite pants and are the only ones i continue to buy! love the fit and they are comfortable. they have pockets just where i need them. definitely would buy again! so comfortable. love it but hate i can\\'t wear it. i\\'m 5\\'7&#34; and it shows half of my behind. i even tried to have a shorter friend try it on and she also couldn\\'t wear it for the same reason. very nice quality leggings. wife looks spectacular in these. my new favorite gym wear.  they are so comfortable and the fabric does not ride or stick.  i\\'ll definitely buy another pair of these. i wanted a pair of pants that were extremely comfortable and looked nice for when i fly( 14+ hours). i\\'m not slim and wanted an alternative to yoga pants. these pants are really comfortable and nice and work perfectly. the only drawback is they are ever so slightly shear so i put these on in the airport bathroom right before the flight. love em\\' bright color.<br />large was too small and xlarge too big. but overall, i really love these pants fits perfect, gives you support, its very comfortable. highly recommended i love them! so comfy! everyone complemented me on the outfit at the gym.<br />it\\'s very comfortable and the fabric is good quality. i live in these pants and just ordered a couple of more colors. i needed some comfy yoga pants post c-section to wear around the house (and sometimes out of it), and these are great! the waistband is comfortable and doesn\\'t irritate my incision, and the fit is flattering. they are true to size (i\\'m usually a 10/12 in pants size, and i ordered a large). another reviewer commented that they are see-through, but i haven\\'t really found that to be the case. i mean, they are form fitting through the butt and thighs, so perhaps there\\'s more of a chance you can see a panty line, but it\\'s not totally obvious unless you\\'re wearing bright white underwear or something. anyway, i\\'m going to live in these pants forever... or until i have to go back to work. sigh... very comfortable. fit as expected fits well.<br />very comfortable. great just what i expected and wanted. i got the duck pattern of these pj\\'s for my wife for christmas, and she absolutely loves them!  she\\'s been telling me all week how soft and warm they are!<br /><br />i don\\'t know if the other reviewer just bought the wrong size or what, but these fit my wife just fine, going down past her ankles, covering the tops of her feet... and she thinks that the ducky pattern is adorable! love this pants i just hate the fact that they charge way too much for the delivery and they look great on me! lol they are simple with a classic look to them. i\\'ll probably pair with similar color shoes. i really, really like these!!! very comfortable. i wish they were longer as i\\'m almost 6ft but they work. look great great buy. stretch fabric a little heavy though for warmer weather. still, looks great. they kind of seem to be a little high, i guess i might be to tall for these. i dont like that they come up way over my shoes.  will keep to wear around the house. fits great love them for work. the fit is good and i love this colour \\'candlelight\\'. the information re sizing was accurate and i received my package in good time. thanks for the catalogues included. comfortable...i like the fit.  only problem is that they seem to collect a large amount of lint on them, no matter what i have them on around or what i do? i ordered these pants in pink and absolutely love them! i wanted to get them in white but i\\'m afraid they will be see through. i am 5\\'2\\\\\\\\\" and 113 pounds and got the xs. they fit great, although are a little tight on my behind and bit long so i will have to wear heels. great buy.. you won\\'t be disappointed! i bought these as a gift for my boyfriend. he\\'s a huge punisher fan. comic and movie. he was excited when he got them and he wears them all the time. says they are super comfortable and they fit perfectly. i was a bit worried when i saw they shipped from china, but i got exactly what the picture shows. the quality is really nice. i normally wear a small and ordered a small, they fit me just fine if a bit too long. will probably buy again at a later date. wife loves her new pajama pants! i think you will looker them too! fits as expected and nice and soft on the legs. love em nice, if you wear a medium, you should buy a small used 12 pair for costumes at my theatre.  looked great and fit just like the chart listed. everything as expected, it fits and is soft, what else can i say? i like these scrubs...i cannot say i love them..the fit was ok..im a curvy gal and they were tighter in the rump area but alot of thigh room.i was not happy after washing them..they wrinkled and attracted alot of lint regardless of how many fabric sheets i used... the pants run small i\\'m loose 14 and tight 12 so i ordered a 14. if you are a tight 14 then order a 16. they stretch and are just the right length! very comfortable! great fit and love the pattern! like it though. adequate quality for sleepwear nice pants! cute, but a little tight in the calves. not a stretchy material at all. i\\'m happy with them nice for the island excellent material and fit. falls nicely.  only problem is pattern wasn\\'t lined up symmetrically. one is slightly twisted back a little more.... but will defintely buy more :) sexy i have worn acetate blend pants for many years as they are both dressy and comfortable. these pants are of good quality although the knit is not as smooth as other pants i have owned.  the color is a chocolate brown,  not very dark. the fit is a bit on the small side...i normally can wear either an xl or 1x however with these,  i would suggest ordering one size larger.  all in all,  they are a good value and are very comfortable. too small and returned it good pants i have an addiction to leggings, these ones are so cute and i love wearing them everywhere. the material is soft and smooth. they are very comfortable to lounge in. however, the material does seem to loosen up after an all day wear; leaving certain areas less flattering. it fits as expected, kind of see through fabric. i feel very sexy wearing them and confident wearing the bell bottom pants down the street. awesome !going to get another pair just because i love having two of things that i love. just in case! very beautiful pants! for all events! so in live with it! just fitted and i needed more space i suggest going a size up for this. i\\'m 5\\'6, 36d-29-36 and 136lbs and went with a large. i normally wear medium in tops and smalls/mediums in bottoms.  large fits perfectly.<br /><br />with that aside, this is a great workout outfit! the bottoms are cute, and it\\'s a solid 2 for 1 deal. highly recommended, and i\\'m going to be getting more of these from haby to wear together and to mix and match with my other tops/bottoms! these are awesome! great! i like these pants and i am keeping them.  that said, they are what i would call large.  not extra large.  the good thing is they stretch. excellent exactly what i was wanting and fits beautifully! have another pair.  these fit even better, though they are the same size.  i\\'m happy with the style, otherwise i would never have purchased a second pair. i wear these as maternity pants. they don\\'t stay up on their own so i wear them with my bellaband. they are so comfortable, nice and long. i have them in fuchsia too and really want the mocha. i received this at a discounted price to give a honest review. i love the colors and the fit of them.  although i need to still lose winter weight, they are comfortable and the right size.  my daughter saw them and says hey they look good on you.  so totaly like the vibrant colors thank you. good quality, super soft. like it very much! it fits great only 1 concern, the front rises up a little, but other than that i love them . love email.  quality fabric comfortable fit and well made for price. worried a bit when i went through others review about the cargo pants, it puzzled me a bit as some says it runs small but others say run large. so simply followed the size chart on the product page, it fits well when arrived. so few notes about the pants: 1, the fabric is thick, not like other cargo pants with cheap flimsy fabric, but the pants does not stretch. 2, love the pocket design and drawstring at the cuff 3, the fabric is a bit of too thick for summer, but would be perfect for any other seasons overall speaking, nice cargo pants, good quality, nice design. excelente the leggings are very cute--i remember they had a vague almost plastic-y smell to them when they first came in the mail (and were a little on the slow side--i got them almost a month after ordering), but it quickly faded. they stretch well, too, and i am a size 8 pants. i am 5\\'1\\'\\' and 135 lbs. i ordered small (as i did for ralph lauren similar pants). fits like a glove. colorful flowers on black look very nice. they are long, so petite women would have to  wear them with high heels. these tights/leggings are super cute. they are very warm and thick, but without making your legs look fatter. they are pretty strechy but a little on the short side. i\\'m 5\\'4\\\\\\\\\" and they hit just above my ankle. i usually wear them with boots so it doesn\\'t matter, and i can strech them down below my heel when i wear booties. i\\'m think of adding some elastic to wrap under my foot since they are strechy just don\\'t stay when you pull them down. they fit my hips well. i wear a size 4 and have 38\\\\\\\\\" hips and 27\\\\\\\\\" waist. i can still stick my hand in and pull it out quite a bit (very strechy!). they are very comfortable. i wish they had more colors and designs! these look like normal leggings, but they are very warm and fashionable and i loved the different patterns.  buying more shrunk after washing. ممتازه جدا incredibly soft, light weight fleece... love the pockets...even though these are for women, they run small...i am 5\\'4 130 lbs. i bought 6 pairs for the winter in both large and x large.  both sizes work for  me and fit comfortably lose....draw stings help i absoutely love these they are so comfortable to where now in the summer time because they are thin and not hot. i purchased two different pair of harem pants and love them!  casual or dressy you cant go wrong. very comfortable fit good too long for me, i\\'m 6 ft have to shorten them a bit lol good i love the way these jeans fit.  they hold in the parts that need to be held in, allowing you to move comfortably and without feeling like you are wearing a girdle.  highly recommend them. right now they are perfect but i hope the do not shrink. i wear a 6 so this medium is right at the edge of tight. lenght cloth quality drape and ties are good! the waist detail works very well to slim. i luv this pants they fit so good i purchased more colors these are great pants. once you decide your fit-i\\'m a size 6 and i ordered an xxl-you will love these. the material is thick and washes well. i can\\'t wait to order another two pairs as i already have 2. the fabric is versatile and comfortable. i can pair these pants with a blazer for work or a tank top for yoga class. the fabric is lightweight and breathable which is ideal for phoenix weather. nice fitting love it no complaints fits perfect received in the suggested time frame it\\'s definitely something i wear to go running and the gym very comfortable with a great fit. a little thin but not &#34;see thru.&#34; i love them , so comfy and warm the fit was ok and i expect it to be better as i am losing weight, but it seemed to be a bit too small for me.  also, i am a borderline petite and the pants that accompanied the top were short.  my height is 5\\'4&#34;  with an hourglass figures so use your judgement accordingly.  if you are pear shaped they may draw up a bit.<br /><br />that being said, i love the feel of this material and it is like wearing your pajamas all day since it is so forgiving when you move or sit.  if they had more designs with this style of outfit i would definitely buy it again. good great pair of flowing pants! i am 5\\'2, they are slightly long, but i don\\'t mind that...very comfy and looks great! i just received the pants in the mail and wanted to thank the previous reviewers for commenting on the size. i\\'m usually a 7/8 and normally buy medium pants. thanks to the wonderful advice of the other reviewers i bought an extra small and they fit perfectly. i was a little leery choosing the xs, but they way they are made i\\'m glad i did. they are very comfortable and i will buy other colors. i ordered a larger size because i knew these ran a little small. they are really nice quality and they make my butt look great, they are very businessy looking which i really like. i highly recommend them. i like that the waist is high so i don\\'t get my love handles looking awkward. i received this product for a discount or for free in exchange of an honest and unbiased review. i love these pants!  these are a great summer weight linen and are extremely comfortable.  i am 5\\'9.5\\\\\\\\\" and they are long enough to wear with heels.  i think they do run a tad small; after reading other\\'s reviews i ordered a large (normally wear a size 8 or med) and the large fits great.  these pants washed up great and have become my summer favorite. these excellent pants are 60% cotton/40% polyester and fit well. the cotton/polyester percentages should be specified on the web page, because i almost didn\\'t order them, fearing that they were more than 50% polyester--which i don\\'t like because of the pilling and less comfort. but i phoned woman within and they told me the actual percentages, so i ordered them. the fleece is reasonable but not thick, and they are soft, comfortable, and well designed. i ordered them a little big so they fit perfectly after washing in warm water and drying. i have also been to 5 different targets in search of the khaki pants. it seems that they only carry larger sizes. i cannot find a size small. i live in west palm beach and unfortunately, the target stores around here seem to cater to larger women. i think it\\'s great but smaller people need clothes too! love very cool pants these are fabulous, i wish they came in sizes other than xsm and sm. i would love to own more of these in different colors and larger sizes, can you help me out there?? good very nice pants, at my normal size it is a bit tight and i have a muffin top. luckily i am wearing these pants with a corset top so it hides the muffin top and looks awesome. little bit small, might consider going up a size from your normal. i\\'m s, ordered in l, and it fits great. these pants fits well, the hips and the length are perfect. i would order more if i run across some different colors. speedy delivery of product in excellent condition! my granddaughter is very happy with it!! it really stretch love it. very comfortable pants, like the pockets, and they wash well. got these as a gift for my sis she is a plus size girl and she loves them they fit perfectly! would recommend to anyone wanting some nice fitting leggings! she said they are really comfortable too! it took me an hour online to finally find these. my granddaughter was very happy, so i am happy and she had nothing bad to say about them. if the quality and fit where horrible she would have let me know. thanks a bunch!!! love them! it was a good buy. better then we expected. comfy, but already beginning to wear out a bit.<br />cons: i don\\'t expect these to last very long, as i\\'ve only worn them a few times and they\\'re already starting to get fuzzy/wear a bit in the thigh area. pros: they are very comfortable and fit well.<br />overall i think next time i will spend a bit more on something that will last a little longer. love theis pants. the fit well and look nice.they are a lovely color of brown wish they had them it the dark, dark brown also. this jumpsuit is a cute design but i guess i didn\\'t pay attention to the word &#34;polyester&#34; in the description because i was surprised at the material.  it feels more like rayon.  it\\'s soft and stretchy which i like but it\\'s a little shiny and thin.  i\\'m 5\\'4 140lbs and the large fit just right.  the only problem is it\\'s a little short for my taste, i wish the pants legs were longer.  it\\'s also a little tight between the legs but the stretchy material makes it not uncomfortable. they look great on. i ordered a size up and they are still a pinch snug, but look great! i love them, the compliments i\\'ve receive indicate others like them. would it be too far to say i think they are out of this world? a little long but super comfy!! fits great and very unique style.  i get all great compliments! they are roomy and very comfortable. love these pants.  like the other reviewers said they are very long and that\\'s why i chose pants that had a pattern that when you hemmed them  you won\\'t notice. i like that they are a little big i have had these pants for about a year.  they are great quality and soooooo comfortable!  i have the color shown and they are my favorite.  definately one of my better purchases.  they are versatile and go with almost anything! wash before wearing these.  i ended up covered in lint after wearing them to an zumba class.  i love that they have pockets.  they\\'re incredibly soft. nice looks very sexy on my babydoll turns me on, looking good and tend to buy more, she loved it very much these are really cute but i guess my legs are shorter than most peoples, by the time i got them hemmed to fit i lost a lot of the nice print around the bottom. other than that, i like them very much. pants were very nice. the price was right. they are nice and comfortable!  they fit nice and they are so soft.  i would definitely recommend to other women! i\\'ve been searching for cargo pants exactly like these for a very long time. they\\'re perfect. fit just right too. this is actually the first of its kind in my wardrobe and...i love it! i found this to fit me quite perfectly in a size small. i\\'m average height and about 110 lbs.<br />a lot of others were talking about the cheapness of the material, but this is a classic case of &#34;you get what you pay for.&#34;<br />the material is very see- through,as stated by other reviewers. if you are are modest like i am, you will want to find something to go under the shorts especially, so everybody\\'s not checking out your underpants.<br />in my opinion, it\\'s not that bad and it\\'s actually better than i had hoped for the price.<br />does the product look the same on me as it does on the model? of course not! i think a lot of these women expect it will, but let\\'s be realistic, ladies! most of us are not proportioned like that!<br />overall, i think it\\'s a cute 2 piece that was worth the price i paid. i wouldn\\'t have expected anything more. i have to admit, in the past i have not liked the clothing that target carried.  however, these capri\\'s have started to turn my opinion.  if a pair of pants makes my rear end look good, i will buy it for life.  these capri\\'s do make it look good, plus they are super comfortable.  i never want to take them off!! i love these so much!  my husband (who hates capris) actually loved the the way they look on me too! i bought these a while ago and i wear them all the time. have washed them a lot with  warm water and regular spin.  they are holding up great! very comfortable for sleeping or lounge wear. bought for my mother in law and she like them so much i bought other colors from this set. i tried buying a poly/gab elastic waist slacks- new spring colors (10 petite, papaya) but my mother in law said they were too small in the butt...i would have thought they were the same as these but the pair she got were different... no complaints here!!! they arrived on time and they fit nice. i have a short stature, so they were a bit long, but i love them. im in love them. fits perfectly. i was a lil apprehensive at first. ive never order pants of any sort on-line. but im totally please with my purchase! these are great pants, and i love the color.  my only complaint is i didn\\'t realize the type of material- it is still pretty stretchy, but a lighter material than the extremely stretchy type of jeggings that i was expecting.  however, it is still a very nice material, and i just wanted to make note of the difference for others to be aware of. awesome delivered timely and met expectations. i was very nervous trying this on but i was very relieved that it fits! i am 5ft 8.5inches and it was below my ankle- another great surprise. the waist is a different material that stretches so bear that in mind when you purchase this item. i’m short (5’4) and round (190) and normally wear large in this style of pant but i ordered 1xl and the fit is perfect. waist is comfortable,  length is cropped above ankle as pictured.  great quality too. these cargo\\'s are amazing!  tough, durable fabric w/a little stretch.  they are exactly as pictured.  i bought the black and it\\'s a nice, rich black.  i\\'m now going to order green before they sell out!  i find the cut to be very slimming which i always love.  my only issue is that the waist is gapping at the back and a little big but nothing i can\\'t handle.  buy these if you love cargo\\'s!!!  i noticed a couple negative reviews which left me a bit puzzled because i am very particular when it comes to clothing and i found these to be very impressive and worth the price. nice just what i expected love this pants! long enough and still look nice after several washes. price is perfect! my review showed up elsewhere for some reason, but these are pretty good leggings. the print is a little different (the ones i got look more like the wizards of the west pattern than the black milk one shown) and the black isn\\'t true, but rather a dark gunmetal grey (which i still like). however, the fit is really generous for one-size. i wear a 8-10 at ae, carry all my weight in my waist and these don\\'t pinch at all, and may be a little loose around the middle. so, in short, for the cost these are fantastic leggings. has a nice cut. will order again. before than what i expected i\\'m unusually a large but it\\'s really large it\\'s kidda baggy i\\'m 5,5 and around 150lbs. so yeah it looks like for the beach like some tithing silky. and revealing i like it though for the price not bad. these leggings are awesome! bought them to replace a different pair after those ones ripped. the quality of the fabric is amazing. these are my go to leggings for fall. great fit! loveeeee these!!!! they look so good on and truly give you the cheeky look. i\\'m usually a size xs so seeing they run small, i ordered a small and it fits perfectly. definitely recommend :) so comfy. i pointed these out to my wife who knows a little about nice clothes.  she couldn\\'t believe her eyes that they were selling at this price, so she bought a pair.  when she got them and found out they were legit, she bought one more of each color.  they all came in great condition and the seller was great to work with.  we\\'ve bought multiple items from this seller and they are always good to work with. i had some hesitation with the thought that my order would have to cross the ocean, but those fears were put to rest when my pants came a week earlier than expected. it was a pleasant surprise to see the little \\\\\\\\\"we missed you\\\\\\\\\" note left by the post office. a quick trip to my local usps building and boom new pants straight from thailand. shipping gets an a+<br /><br />the pants themselves did not disappoint either. the discription matches perfectly with the final product. and as an added bonus the pants came with a little string bag for easy storage. if i had one complaint about the pants at all it\\'s that the seams seem to be lacking in the strength area, but that\\'s not to say they arnt worth it. i\\'ve only had these pants for two days and that is my initial observation. but hey if they end up failing the seams are simple enough that an unskilled yahoo like me can fix it with thread and needle. product gets an a<br /><br />i highly recommend these pants and this company. my experience with them has been excellent! thank you so much. i loved it 😘 love them i\\'ve had these pants about a month and a half now. i followed the other reviewers advice and ordered a size bigger than my own, and they fit very well. they hold up well, besides the bottom of the leg where my heel rubs it is torn up quite a bit. one of the draw strings fell out because of it. however, i wear these often (at least once a week) so it\\'s understandable. they\\'re made of a more nylon-feeling material versus the same type that men\\'s cargo pants are made of. besides this they seem sturdy, thick, and well made, so i gave them a 5. i will most likely get another pair soon. :) good deal i love a good pair of linen pants.  i had a few pairs of linen pants that were the same name brand, but they had the fold-over waistband, and after wearing those for a little while, they stretched out so much that they were literally falling off of me. i ordered these because they had the drawstring waist.  so much better!! i am 5\\'7&#34; and 130lbs.  i ordered a medium in these pants, and i am happy.  at first, they were a little tight around the waist, but they loosened up and were fine.  i gave these a 4 star rating because of the length.  they are not too short, but they are also not as long as i like my pants.  i like to be able to wear boots or wedges with my pants and still have them touch the ground.  these are not long enough for that, but they will be perfect with small wedges and flats.  for the price, these pants are of good quality, and i am happy. great fit and very comfortable, will order more colors!! love the variety of the patterns to select from.  very happy! these are really nice slacks.  it is so hard to find navy slacks anywhere.  i was not sure about ordering on-line, so i ordered two different sizes and returning the one that didn\\'t fit for a full refund was very easy.  the fit is excellent, the waist band does not roll and there are no pockets, welts, belt loops, zipper, etc. to add bulk.  they are very flattering.  the side zipper works well, too. these are the best slacks i have found in a long time.  i did purchase another pair in the size that fit.  the inseam on one pair was 31&#34; and the other pair 32&#34;... love it! fits as expected good product these pants fit really nicely and are for the &#34;fun&#34; part of my wardrobe. they are really long, as i expected they would be. i simply cut them off. i\\'ve seen these in many stores without hems, so you can cut them off to fit or cut and hem them--the fabric will not ravel. really comfy! because the waist is simply a fold over, you can fold to fit where you would like to wear them, down on the hip or really high up on or above the waist. did i mention they are really comfortable? they have no elastic in the waist so they don\\'t pinch and fit smoothly under a tee or tank top. i have several pair of these--some for casual party or afternoon/evening out, some for around the house lounge pants.  i\\'m taking several to hawaii when we go.  btw, most photos show models in high heels, but even though i\\'m short (5\\'1&#34;), i wear them with just a little wedge sandal, about 1&#34;, and they look great. they are so comfortable, i\\'m thinking of wearing them on the plane next trip! its okay, i liked it at first, but its really small. you have to make it look good. the picture makes it look nice, i only wore this once and i was able to pull it off..probably looks nice on girls with skinny legs. love the scrubs. ..awesome delivery..very quick and efficiennt..thank you bunches:) cute pants, fit well! i have a 36&#34; inseam and the pants are long enough, i ordered a medium. nice for just black pants to wear running errands that aren\\'t that jogger pants look. careful of what size you buy, i looked at the size chart and guessed about my size and it still fit a little more snug than i wanted. on the other hand, with a big shirt to cover up some of the tightness it still looks cute when i\\'m out and about work fairly well, would buy again. gave a pair to daughter, she likes these arrived in time for me, they fitted correctly, the material is kinda dressy, i thought better then the photograph and so compfy and stylish, well worth the money great scrubs long enough for my 34&#34; inseam! fold-down band helps &#34;control&#34; the little love handles on the hips. bought dark gray and black and will purchase again. light weight, a little clingy, but what do you expect in a yoga pant? nice fit. true to description. nice material. perfect length for my height. great buy and nice replica of a jean leggings like this fit much better than wide leg cotton.  did not have to hem this one as i did the wide leg.<br />wasn\\'t sure what the difference was between the two until i got which is why i ordered  both.  little hard to understand the difference from the description.  happy with this pair. all excellent like these for the price. i was a little worried that the size was s/m because i am usually a small but they fit like a small as far as i can tell! i was also worried about thin material being see-through but no issues there, either (i got the purple-ish to light blue color, though, i suppose that could vary by color). overall i\\'m happy with this purchase, the only thing that may have prevented me from buying if i tried them on in person first is that they\\'re sort of knitted, so just from sitting on a bench outside the second time i wore them, little pill-thread things came out a bit. no serious damage yet, but more spandexy material wouldn\\'t have done that. love these are nice material and the fit is perfect in the waist but not roomy in the back--a bit tight in the buttocks region for a woman with a healthy booty--unless you like it tight. as far as length, these are long on me and will require hemming (i\\'m 5\\'2&#34;).  otherwise, construction is good and the design is lovely! the pants are my size 5x and that size is hard to find.  they are comfortable and have pockets i required fit kinda tight i would recommend going up a size. they are low rise but overall comfortable! i have a really difficult time finding jeans that work for me and then i found the miss me jeans.  just a simple pair, no bling and they are wonderful.  i am now going to be buying a lot more of these. these jeans are perfect for all year round. i like the pants, however i think all the pants in this category are overpriced.  other than that the pants were a good purchase.  comfortable. i have always bought the koi lindsay pants, personally i prefer the waistband on the morgan and it is my new favorite scrub pant! nice quality, good length. received as a gift and love. i liked them because they were light and not heavy feeling runs just a bit big great quality denim joggers. very soft and true to size.  great pair of pajama pants and very comfortable.  the pattern is fun and they were appreciated. love the fabric. they are form fitting. they are appropriate work & school attire. once i wash them i will update how they hold up.<br /><br />i received this product at a discount for my honest & unbiased opinion. i bought these capris and the bodywear navy top last summer for my trip to vegas.  i\\'m always so uncomfortable in jeans, and who wants to dress up for a plane ride?  i went to target and found these two items.  they moved with me and were so easy to wear.  wash them in cold water, hang them up and you\\'re done!  easy wear and care?, can\\'t beat it...nor the price! order the pants a size up, as other reviews mentioned they fit tight around the thighs.  i\\'m normally a maternity medium, purchased a large.  i should of ordered a medium; the legs are so loose.<br /><br />good buy. love the look and the feel! loved the fit, color, quality and price. finally someone figured out what women want. going to get all colors out there. !!!!!! i was surprised that these pants fit me. i don\\'t have an hourglass figure like may makers of pants think about women - my waist is a size larger than my hips so i have a terrible time finding pants that fit, but these fit great and they\\'re really cute! the only down side to them is that they are a bit too heavy for summer wear, especially here in florida. too bad they don\\'t have a lightweight version. these fit as expected since everyone said they ran small.  i normally wear a size 2 or 4 in pants/shorts depending on store.  i ordered the medium. i did have to move the button over to make the waist smaller but i do like these a lot.  i am going to order another pair. these are very high quality snowmobile pants with detachable suspenders (huge preference for me). i especially love the artwork so they are easily identifiable in a pile of black bibs.  zippers and snaps simplify boot access.  these are a must for the coldest of snowmobiling rides. i wore these pants to a brunch with an elegant top and had nothing but compliments. the fit is extremely flattering, and the material is slinky and wonderful. they can be dressed up or worn casually, and, they don\\'t wrinkle!! i am very tall and on the bigger side, the length is good and they are true to size, my feeling is they do not need to be purchased larger or smaller. i suppose they might be a bit long for someone very short, but could easily be hemmed up i think. wonderful pants! i love them! these are somewhat tight at the top and sooo long. (i am 5\\'2&#34;.) these are one size fits *most* pants and as we all know, not everyone is the same size. if you don\\'t usually fit into one size fits most clothing you probably wont fit into these. these pants fit between a small and large size. i am 5\\'7&#34; and 135 lbs and these fit very comfortably on me. the waistband could easily accommodate someone with more waist or hips than me and the legs are flowy enough with elastic for the ankles that it would fit most different heights. they are slightly sheer especially with light behind them but that is to be expected from this type of pants. the fabric is light, again to be expected with these pants. i love these and have bought multiple colors. as other reviewers mentioned, these are tight in the thighs.  i do have larger thighs (well, maybe average for an american woman), so i was expecting this.  they\\'re still very comfortable and with some use, they stretch out a bit. i love these harem pants. i\\'ve gotten countless compliments on them. the material is not too thick nor too thin. it is completely opaque and lets your legs breathe. definitely going to buy more. i love these! they are super stretchy. come just above my ankles so they don\\'t get in the way while i dance. (i\\'m 5\\'9)  and they look lovely and flow well :d they are sheer though - white leggings underneath worked well. love the look but too small. good love these slacks! ruby rd is a go - to brand for me and these slacks didn\\'t disappoint. the fit is perfect and feel is great. i\\'m 5\\'3\\\\\\\\\" and this style runs a little short. good with flat heeled or running shoes but for me is too short for a shoe with any type heel.<br /><br />will definitely buy ruby rd from amazon again. these flannel pants are made well and are warm. i love the colors too. i wish you had more colors to chose from. i love these pants!!! i will be ordering more in a variety of colors! the mint is pretty and very spring time! :) the in seam is 29&#34;. so it might be little long for women who are below 5ft, unless it shrinks. its loose and comfortable for women who are under 120 lbs. it says petite in the title but the tag of the pants says small. i could have sworn i ordered one navy and one black but both came in as black. too minor an issue to return. these are the perfect solution to humid summers. the pants are colorfully beautiful, comfortable and so much fun to wear out and at home (no more uncomfortable thighs in jeans dilemmas). i want two in every color and then some. the only downside was that the fabric is so lightweight that a pen put a tiny pen-sized hole in the pocket, but i won\\'t let that deter me from ordering another pair. i love these pants! they are comfortable and sexy. they fit great- better than i even expected or hoped for! i\\'ve owned dozens of different brands of jeans, and these are by far the best  fitting and most comfortable.  my choice for future purchases. fit as expected, true to size. these leggings are super adorable!<br />they fit comfortably and have a good stretch to them. it\\'s a perfect complement to a black skirt and blue t shirt. love them my mom thinks they\\'re nice. material is nice, easy to care for washes beautifully. measurements given accurate and true to sizing. fits well but i took a star off because when i washed it the ears were about to fall off. i have to re sew it. other than that its perfect i love these! they are ridiculously comfortable and fit perfectly. traditional, basic colors which coordinate with many items.  the fabric is lightweight, loose, and smooth without any stray threads.  seams and hems are well sewn.  great sleepwear for hot summers. i absolutely love love love love these pants! i live in south georgia & have both heat & humidity! i have to admit i was a little leary of purchasing these pants because i find that spandex, polyester, & rayon fabrics don\\'t tend to breath well &  can make you sweat even more than cotton but not these guys they are super wonderful & i feel like i\\'m wearing pajamas all day! i\\'m disabled with both brain & internal organ damage from a drunk driver rear ending me. one of the main problems i have is swelling in my abdominal area due to nerve damage & i have trouble finding comfortable clothes because my stomach will swell from a size 8 up to a 14-16 in a matter of minutes this occurs anytime i eat, exercise, or ride in a car, & it can last for hours or even days depending on how aggravated the damaged nerves get. these pants are great for anyone who suffers from this type of issue because they allow for swelling but also retain their shape when the swelling goes down. i also, due to the extensive surgeries i had to go through, have lymph edema in both legs & leggings do not look good on me because of the swelling there which i suffer with daily from my thighs down. i\\'m so glad these wide leg pants are back in fashion because they are a great camouflage for both of these issues. they are stylish & i\\'m 5\\'9&#34; with long legs & these fit perfectly i think i\\'m a 34&#34; to 35&#34; inseam & these fit me perfectly. i bought the medium. i recommend this product to all women they are the kind of cut that will fit any body type! they are so soft, & comfy & the fabric does breathe well in the heat & humidity so far. i\\'ll try to remember to update this review in august when we really get hot & humid. these pants can be dressed up or down & still look awesome. you can cut them to your desired preference & not have to worry about sewing them because they won\\'t fray so to all you vertically challenged ladies don\\'t be put off by the length just grab some scissors & wack away! the best part is they do not wrinkle!!! which will be great for travel they can be squished into a knot for hours & never have the 1st wrinkle plus they are so thin they will not take up much room or weight in a suitcase which is another money saver when flying. i love the design on these it is so  elegant but you can throw on a tank & lounge around in them too! i wear these everywhere. & have bought several pair from this seller the package arrived much earlier than expected. they were very professional to deal with & even sent a little thank you card with them. i bought several pair from different sellers but ontrend is definitely my favorite! i like the cut, length & feel of their pants the best. i am currently recovering from a broken hip because i had a seizure & these are so much easier to move around in bed with than my cotton pjs.  please note that the black & white design is in a different area on each leg so they do not match up perfectly like in the pic but if you so desire that i\\'m sure they would be glad to oblige just ask before you buy. i had to email  them about the inseam & they responded very quickly. thanks ontrend!part is they do not wrinkle!!! which will be great for travel they can be squished into a knot for hours & never have the 1st wrinkle plus they are so thin they will not take up much room or weight in a suitcase which is another money saver when flying. i love the design on these it is so  elegant but you can throw on a tank & lounge around in them too!

i like the cut, length & feel of their pants the best. i am currently recovering from a broken hip because i had a seizure & these are so much easier to move around in bed with than my cotton pjs.  please note that the black & white design is in a different area on each leg so they do not match up perfectly like in the pic but if you so desire that i\\'m sure they would be glad to oblige just ask before you buy. i had to email  them about the inseam & they responded very quickly. thanks ontrend! i made the mistake of borrowing the caramel colored velour pants from a friend and now i can\\'t take them off. i never, ever, find pants that look good on my body and am forced to wear skirts, even whilst lounging. please, please tell me there is a way to locate a pair in medium. your demand is incredible. please get more.   thank you!   j i love the way this fits! fits well for the price. high-waisted, soft on the inside, comfy stretch leggings. they fit much higher on the belly than in the picture. they aren\\'t see-through as far as i can tell. i\\'m a size 8/9 and don\\'t have much of a butt, so they might be see-through for bigger booty folks. not amazing quality as far as stitching, but it\\'s held together so far through a month of yoga and wear. soooo comfy!! my daughter was very happy to finally get a pair of galaxy tights. they look exactly like the picture. the material is thick so you can not see threw them and the colors are rich. the stitching is not the best, but they did survive there first trip through the washer. after ordering the 16 i still felt i could fit a smaller size.  so i ordered a 14 and it fitted perfectly.  i was planning to order two more, but found out that you didn\\'t have it available.  so i looked at other sites and ordered similar jeans, but they too were being delayed in the markets.  where are all they affordable elastic jeans?????? i was worried that the top would be too large for my b cups but it fit nicely.  the material has the capability of stretching over any sized breasts.  also don\\'t let the corset look fool you, it won\\'t tie down any bulges you may have.  it is a very comfortable, form fitting garment.  i\\'m glad i purchased it. i am normally a medium size, and only large was left, but it was described as eurasian, and fitted fine. this is the second pair i\\'ve bought.  they are my daughter\\'s favorite pajama bottoms. very comfortable i purchased these for zumba looking for something lightweight and comfortable/easy to move in. these pants are a bit on the thin side, but even with light colored underwear you can\\'t see them unless you were to stretch the material super tight. i would recommend going up a size if you\\'re worried about that. but the bonus of the material being thin is that these pants breath! i don\\'t get too hot wearing them. they (again) are super stretchy, which is perfect for work outs like zumba or other aerobics and yoga.  i\\'m thinking of getting another pair in a different colors now. these are way better than i expected. my first pant purchase on amazon so i was nervous about sizing - i am 5\\'8 /130lb so i ordered the xl because i like my pants to be loose fit vs too tight - these are beautifully made super warm fabric long enough and the high waist is done well. overall i am super happy with them and love the unique fabric & feel of these. love the shiny fish scales. perfect for everyday wear or even for halloween! really cute! just what i was needing for spin class! these were perfect! also the delivery time was amazing😊 just received them in today\\'s mail so i haven\\'t washed then yet or had any of the problems with stiching that previous buyers experienced. the seller mentioned on amazon that she addressed this issue so i felt comfortable ordering two pairs (one gray and the other natural). just tried them on and they are quite nice! have almost a linen feel and texture to them. i am 5\\' 10&#34; and i take a medium and usually wear a 31&#34; inseam (32 with jeans) and they have a perfrec length. hope they don\\'t shrink much!<br />they are quite roomy, without looking it. kind of like my old karate gi pants from a long time ago. they look great too. they\\'re light without being too light. and they are very comfortable! if i experience any problems i will write up an addendum, but if they keep their promise i highly recommend them. fair price too. the president of the company went to the trouble of writing up literature of washing dos and donts, nice touch!  jody koval these pants are so hot. when i wear them i feel extra saucy. i love wearing yoga pants on weekends now can wear the style on a daily basis i got so many looks wearing these pants & lots of compliments...yahoo... after reading reviews i am usually more conflicted than i was beforehand. i will do my best to describe the pants that i received. first, i ordered a size medium in grey. they are thin but not see through. i am 5\\'7, 135-140 lbs. these yoga pants are long on me, which i prefer. i tried them on and they hugged my body except for the legs which were roomy. after washing them, if there was any shrinkage it wasn\\'t noticeable. i am satisfied with my purchase and would buy again. i bought these for a cardio class and believe i will be comfortable wearing them and i am sure they will last through it. if anything changes i will update my post.... thank you i love them!  i get tons of compliments and / or stares when i wear these.  :) great pair of pants. bought two in different colours, one\\'s length was just right but the other was 2 inches shorter. have to wear it below my waist to get the right length. otherwise, great buy. when i received this item, i was skeptical it would keep me warm.  i was pleasantly surprised.  this past winter was the most severe i can remember ever.  i work outside in an open area with little to no protection from the elements. i stayed warn wearing these pants. i\\'ve always liked hanes\\' quality.  but these sleep pants fit tighter than walmart\\'s.  and more expensive.  they\\'ll need hemmed a few inches. my wife loves these. she says they are very comfortable. all in all i would order these again if i needed to. the are holding up good these are so cute with the crop top i got to go with them i get a lot of compliments on the out fit. fits perfect. great items. they are a bit see-through but i\\'m wearing them underneath something so it doesn\\'t affect me. perfect. sure to shrink some. pleased... love the design and fit. great price and fast shipping. this is the 4th pair of these i have ordered (at various times over the last 18 months). i love them!  all four were high quality, not see through at all, and surprisingly durable.  i have to pin the bottoms b/c they are a bit long, i even wash them with the pins in them, and i use them to hike, and play with my dog as well; no rips, holes nothing (only got more for variety)! the smalls fit perfectly (i expect everything to be long on me - i\\'m 5\\'2, 110 lbs).  highly recommend, and i\\'m sure i will order more of these when the time comes! very good just received it in omg i fall in love with it!!! worth every dollar<br />the fit is perfect. love the style look just like the photo will be ordering more very soon feel great i just buy for my freind exactly what i wanted... nice . everyone ask me where i got them from. love them..delivery was early. quality is great. fit perfect. keeps their shape beautifully. i absolutely love these pants! super comfy and breathable material! dionysia\\'s daughter -<br />these pants are fantastic. super comfortable and breezy. the height is great for me and doesn\\'t sit low on the hips. i was concerned that it might bunch in between my butt cheeks or between my thighs and i\\'m happy to say it doesn\\'t at all. i think this is because it is made out of real linen and not a polyester blend. i\\'ve gotten lots of compliments on them and i\\'ve only had them for a week. several people have actually asked me where they can buy a pair.<br /><br />overall i think these are really great and comfy pants, even if you\\'re curvy and have a decently sized to big butt and thighs (like me). since you do get a good amount of breeze in there you won\\'t get too sweaty which is great. there are no, uh, bloomers, underneath so if you\\'ve got concerns about chafing (like me) i\\'d definitely do whatever works for you to stop chafing. i personally prefer compression shorts such as those made by underarmour.<br />because of the material and cut i find them way more comfortable than regular sweatpants. i feel like i could live in these and not even care. sleep in \\'em, wake up in \\'em, wash up in \\'em, walk/run in \\'em, go swimming in \\'em, and not even mind. i need to get another pair so i\\'m not avoiding washing them lol.<br /><br />they also seem very gender-neutral so guys can totally wear them too if they want to.<br /><br />the only thing i\\'d change is to give them another pocket. the singular pocket fits my cellphone (lg g4 in a rugged case), keys, and a couple plastic bags or a small wallet, and nothing more. the pocket does have a decent zipper too, which is assuring.<br /><br />i\\'ll try to update my review with pictures later on. great fit got these pants in neon pink for a halloween costume. ordered them on a friday and got them monday! the pants are really bright and super soft. i was worried about sizing (i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; 180lb, and have larger thighs), but the large was plenty stretchy and not see-through as long as you wear nude undies with a lace border or something. i\\'ll definitely end up wearing these again after halloween. perfect! once again, i got a great deal on a nice pair of pants.  they are nice looking, and are washable.  goes well with the pink jacket by the same seller.  great price too. too small for me, but my teenage daughter seemed to love it and she\\'s happy to have it. but unfortunate for me, i thought it would fit me considering that i bought an xl and i\\'m a size 12 didn\\'t fit. the size chart was also off, saying that it would fit a size 12-14. it\\'s not a stretchy material, so didn\\'t fit for me. these are the best-fitting &#34;comfort jeans&#34; i have ever worn.  they look like real jeans, including real front pockets deep enough to hold keys, change, etc., and real rear pockets.  i have been researching this market for quite awhile, and these are my favorites so far . . . and by far!  the rekucci jeans are flattering, very comfortable, and look like regular denim jeans, except for the stretch waistband, which i was pleased to learn does not buckle on me as some others have done.  they stretched out a little bit after wearing over twelve hours during a very active day.  on me, they run slightly (emphasis on slightly) large.  so, between this and the little bit of stretch, you might want to order the smaller size if you are between sizes.  the only picky thing i would add is that i would love to see them offered with belt loops. legging fits on me<br />my husband love this on me as the mom of a one-year old, i was looking for well made yoga pants to wear as a i transition back to my pre-pregnancy wardrobe.  i am 5\\'2&#34; so i knew these pants would be long (they drag the floor unless i am in sneakers).  i thought they would be more snug but i guess now that i am a size 6, they are a little too loose in the waist and hips.  seem to be made well and the fabric feels nice.  probably need a size smaller. this is an excellent item shipping was here before stated packaged in perfect brand new condition! i absolutely have no complaints about anything on this it was done in excellent order!!! no problems whatsoever!!! thank you! i wear size 2. medium size fit me well. the length needs to be adjusted. i got rid of the drawstring. good quality of linen, a little scratchy. i bought both colors. i like it a lot. these pants were exactly as pictured. refreshing to buy something on line and have it look like it does in the picture! great pants, great fit! this jumper is just the ticket for warm days out and about. i am 36b, 29w and 39h and the small fit me perfectly.  i\\'m so happy i got both the teal and black. i absolutely love these pants! i will definitely be getting more. super cute!! i normally wear a u.s. size 10 in this type of clothing. however, after having purchased from sellers overseas i know to order a larger size. i ordered an xl and it fit perfectly!! i wore it with some cute black wedges to work and received many compliments!! i was concerned at first, as this was my first pair of pants bought on amazon.  i\\'m never sure of sizing, especially as a larger-sized individual, but these pants fit perfectly!  they are also so comfortable and lightweight!  (which helps on hot days when i wear them at work.)  i know there were some comments about them being see-through.  but i am not experiencing that issue with the plain black pair of pants i purchased.  they are great! perfect fit the size small was smaller than expected but the material and the way the colors are matched exactly like the display image ok i love these pantalones (pants) ! they are more than just pants, they are fun, alive and beautiful. i\\'m tall with long legs so the length is perfect. all i need is a black or white top and a killer pair of earrings and i\\'m ready for anything! really good fit and quality. i ordered large and i wear a size 8, they launder nice and are really comfortable. the wife is very happy with them pants fit as kinda small. model waist and height was the same as mine but my hips were a 40 and they said she wore a 4. i got a 10 because i wanted a very loose fit  and i wanted longer length but pants were not as loose as i would of liked but they do fit loose. good length on pants. did not use drawstring because it fit my waist perfectly with the elastic band. bought the black pair again and this time chocolate brown. the chocolate brown really is not that chocolate more like mocha. these are great! you can fold them over or not if you desire pants that come to your waist. i\\'m old school and have had trouble getting used to pants that don\\'t come all the way up to the waist. thinner cotton and light weight fabric has been great for those hot humid days. this was the style and color i needed for a costume i\\'m creating. the fabric is thick and stretchy and very comfortable. i would recomend this product. i bought these in flannel too, but i like the cotton knit better for warmer nights. the musical notes are very cool. my kids like them, too. fit as expected and very comfortable. these are amazing!  i\\'m 5\\'10 and 147 pounds and they are the perfect length.  i will definitely be buying many more! this fits very well. the pants might be an inch too long but i\\'m only 5&#34;2. i weigh 110 so pretty thin and it wasn\\'t too loose or too tight. they are cute and perfect for what i need. runs a bit small still happy with the product. hard to find cargo pants in stores. good as it appeared i love these!!! i will be getting more in every color i can! i highly recommend them! the size options were small, medium, large ect. i ordered large for my daughter, who is tall (5\\'7&#34;) since the sizing is in juniors. however, when the product came, the pants say med/large, so they are a little shorter than juniors large. they still look good on her. other than that they are great! love it! love them!\\' pants fit as expected, love the banded waist. way too long, so will have to shorten them - not 5\\'10&#34; my husband threw a 60\\'s birthday party for my 60th b-day - these pants were a hit!  the psychedelic pattern was perfect and i got tons of compliments!  the fit was perfect (i\\'m 5\\'8&#34; 130#).  the legs were a bit tight around the thighs but there was enough give in the material which made them super comfortable - i could be the perfect hippie host of the party feeling completely comfortable in my pants! :o) perfect trousers for lounging.  but more importantly, and the reason i bought them, they are great for gardening in the heat!  the elastic at the ankles seems like it may help avoid ticks and spiders crawling up my leg - no hitchhikers wearing these!  and they enable me to squat, lunge, step over low fences and logs. these pants work well for me. i ordered these pants in i believe an xl. i knew i was pushing it when i did. when they got to me, i was very excited. i tried them on. they went on me very easily. i was shocked. normally i have a hard time just getting these kind of pants up past my thighs. i got them up but could not button them. i was sad over this. however, because i am on the path of losing weight, i have now made it my goal to fit into these and be able to button them up and feel comfortable. i just want to point out that i wear a size 14/16 in pants and an xl in this kind of pant is able to fit me. just depends on how much belly fat you have.<br /><br />*i received this product in exchange for an honest review. all opinions expressed here are 100% my own. my 16 yr old son bought these for something funky to wear to school during spirit week.  he\\'s a thin 5\\'7&#34; and they fit him just they way he hoped -- really baggy and full -- and the ankle length was spot on. the big discussion at school was what they are called, harem vs. parachute pants, with parachute pants winning. he mentioned that they could easily be worn midway up the calf; the elastic is comfortable though it wouldn\\'t stay for long.  downside for laundry time: wash separately! the red fabric runs terribly, as he discovered when he washed them with his tennis uniform! i really love these for the price and they really look great on only issue is the fabric is thin but that is okay can\\'t beat the price. thank you so much amazon...<br />they are awesome.....:):):)👍<br />nice nice nice......!!!! i read the reviews and ordered small. i usually wear a m bottom and a l (big busted) and i ordered small for both and they fit, maybe even a little too loose but not bad for the price. i dont want my scrubs to be form fitting as i move around a lot at work. they are easy to wash and wear. after i recieved my first order to make sure the sizing was right i ordered another 5 pair. now im set! i only put 4 stars because of the sizing. love them! exactly what i thought and so comfortable. i am 5\\'8 and they are the perfect length. i enjoy this pant they fit so well and the material is great. i thought the fit was true to size and i was really happy about that. the shirt is a little on the big side but not too loose fitting and the pants fits good the material is comfortable. the color hasn\\'t faded great fit, i\\'ll probably purchase another one:) i do love this, only negative comment is that it juts out on each side. i expect you can fold these &#34;tents&#34; in for pockets, but it does add a bit of bulk to your frame, especially if you have a bit of extra bulk there already. overall i am still quite pleased with this. i love, love the pattern!! these pants are amazing. super flexible through my workouts, keeps me cool. the are beyond comfortable. i own a lot of these types of pants. most of them are a let down. the also hold up to washes. i am addicted to these and will be buy many more! they are not see through like many as well. they are a thicker fabric. these are nice leggings, but the fabric is a little cheap. i usually like a little better-constructed garments. great pants same as pictured. i am 5.8 and long enough. ordered a different color and a pair for my mom. it is a comfortable lingerie, excellent article to ride my bike for more than an hour. i highly material and preparation. very nice great look. comfortable fit. stretchy. delivery arrived as per estimated. love them. everything i hoped this was a gift for my mom in mothers day, she is very small 5\\'0 (height) and thin. they fit perfect! the cloth is very high quality and comfortable. i want one for me now! love them! they are long.  i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; and they touch the ground on me.  they are very comfortable! really love grey\\'s anatomy scrubs. they\\'re comfortable, soft, durable, and don\\'t fade after numerous washes. however, their pants seem to run on the smaller size. i\\'m a size 16-18 and the xlp are slightly too tight in the waist and upper thighs. i would recommend going up a size if you\\'re on the thicker/more muscular side. on the bright side, their petite measurements are perfect!! i\\'m 5\\'3\\'\\' on a great day, and they are perfect for my height! these shorts fit great. when i ordered these, the ad said that the sizing was smaller than us sizes but it wasn’t too far off.  i just ordered one size larger than i normally wear and they fit great.<br /><br />the print is bright and the color was true to the photo.  i am very happy with these shorts.  they are perfect for swimming because i don’t typically like wearing a bathing suit bottom and these are not heavy in the water at all.<br /><br />the pockets are a bonus but i don’t use them much because i mainly wear them for swimming. very cute! from someone who stupidly spent $100 on a pair of lulu lemon leggings (which started pilling after wearing them once)... these by 90 degree are a million times better for a fourth of the price!  i first bought these pants at marshall\\'s and fell in love with them immediately and quickly ordered more after that! i usually wear a size small/medium but am an extra small in these pants. the pair that i first bought over a year ago are still in perfect condition after countless workouts, lounge days, ski trips, and hiking adventures. i highly recommend! the pants fit just nice. they not to loose or to tight. they also wash nicely. i bought two and will buy more later. i purchased these for my wife.  she loves these to take walks with the dogs now she has pockets for stuff rather than me always using my pockets for her stud, cell phone etc.<br />also these fit, from a man\\'s point nice!  her bottom looks great in these! more please!! i love love love these!! i love them. comfortable and cute at the same time. fits perfect, fast delivery they\\'re a blue background, not black. still cute. cute shirt but runs smaller than i expected.  i feel that it is short too.  i had to keep pulling it down. too long had to cut them.. but super comfy! these are perfect! make sure you order 1 to 2 sizes up as these are in asian sizes and fit most american ladies tight, or snug.  these are heavy duty and will work well for a any occasion.  they arrived fast and were well packed.  so beautiful - i bought all colors.  i think they may shrink a bit so going to wash in cold, then air dry, or tumble dry  fyi - i am a normal size 0-2 in american sizes, so i ordered the x large i\\'m 5\\'4 about 155lbs mostly in the butt/hips/thigh area. i ordered a large in the tribalpt and they are very nice. the material is quite thin &very stretchy. the print is pretty. they are long enough to cover my booty (no crack) & feet. i was looking for nice palazo pants, next time i\\'ll probably get the next pair in medium as they were a little wider on the hips than i needed. rarely write reviews.  these worth effort to say how great they are.  material is wonderful. fit is perfect.  the pocket on the side thigh is perfect.  i will get more of these very comfortable..thank you! nice romper. comfy stretchy fabric. there are ties that are not seen in this picture. i didn\\'t prefer these and so removed them with relative ease. neckline can be a little low but i fixed this with a cami bra. extremely flattering! i\\'m 5\\'7\\\\\\\\\" and usually a us size 6-8 in pants, and an asian l size in these fit me perfectly besides being a little bit long which i don\\'t mind. fits like a second skin, has plenty of stretch, and does not feel flimsy, and keeps me warm enough in frigid winters. the comfort of leggings,and the clean, edgy look of leather! i got these to wear on new year\\'s eve, and they were perfect. i\\'ve gotten plenty of compliments! the matte black is nice because it looks unique but does not stand out in a tacky way. the high-rise is also extremely comfortable and flattering. fit really nicely over my curvy hips and rear. and, it gets better - these are completely machine washable!! 100% polyester. i got these in size small from tj maxx for slightly cheaper than amazon\\'s price, but nothing crazy - i will repurchase from amazon in the future as tj maxx doesn\\'t always have the same stuff.<br />i am 5\\'9, 150lbs and the small fit me perfectly. i am normally a medium, but in leggings and such i like them to fit tightly and snug, so i can workout without worrying about pulling them up. even still i did not expect the smalls to fit as well as they do. like, obscenely well. if i do say so myself, they make my legs and butt look amazing. i am in love. my husband likes them too. i have worn them twice already and will update if anything changes. wife loves these, fits perfectly!  very comfy!!!! the girl i bought this for is in sandusky. the only thing i knew was it fit and she like them. it was her birthday gift, okay wow i love them have 4 pair now love these pants! super comfy and lightweight material....!! love all the pockets!  i am a size 7 and i got the xl.  they fit loose and low around my waist... perfectly! i can style this with almost anything and it looks great! nice pants, will keep me warm this winter krazy larry has a great product.  however, sizing can be inconsistent.  but you won\\'t find a better wash and wear pair of pants. love these pants! they are the perfect length! love these pants! got one of the bully antler stick<br />and both of out dogs love it and it lasts i love how they feel and look. i just wish they were a little longer. yes the fit on this is on point. a bit long for me (i\\'m 5\\'4&#34;) but very comfortable and appropriate for yoga. love it great! these tights are very soft and very good looking,even better than the picture.i would recommend these very highly as they are really comfortable. true fit, good length.love koi. love the pockets front and back.<br />nine more words..i do not understand why there has to be a word requirement<br />for ratings....makes me not want to rate things..... really good quality, comfortable. size runs small. excellent product, prompt delivery i love them i read the reviews before i bought them so i went a size up they fit like a glove tight glove but good!! [[videoid:64ca16132bb95d038cf7248d69958408]]it is so hot this summer i needed a nice versatile piece of clothing that didn\\'t make me burn up. i thought of so many things to do with this jumpsuit. you could wear it by itself, put a top over it, put on a cardigan or shrug, fold down the top and just use it as pants. the list goes on and on!<br /><br />the fabric is super soft and very stretchy. it is comfortable and forgiving of my post-partum body (especially since it is black). it is quite lightweight, which is good and bad because under strong light my bra could be seen! please keep this in mind when picking your underwear and bra colors because it could be quite embarrassing.<br /><br />all in all i am very happy with my super comfy jumpsuit.  i\\'m so glad i received this item for free or at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. i couldn\\'t be happier with this product. loved it, used it as a lingerie for my honeymoon, it became my fave piece of sexy clothing, i also used it for a beach cover up!  i have big thighs and it has lots of room in it.  i also got the black as well! excellent i love these pants! they are incredibly comfortable and fit just right. they seemed a bit bright when i first put them on, however, you can just about wear any color you want with them. i\\'m buying another pair today....i\\'ll send a review on them as well. i really expected these pants to run small but i\\'m a size 10, 5\\'1&#34;and they are perfect. adorable and comfy. i ordered two more one as a gift and she loved them. i got me two elephants and peacock for the gift. beautiful pants! cute fun pants. daughter loved them because of the pattern and the soft material. the legginigs are cute; sizing is women\\'s s/m.  pricing was great, and the delivery was really fast.  material appears to be polyester/ nylon, so may be too warm to wear in the summer, but cute for spring/ fall. summery, but heavy enough so that your underwear doesn\\'t show through. so comfortable, i got a lot of compliments when i wore them.  great buy for the price.  totally worth it. finally a pair of scrub pants that aren\\'t baggy.  comfortable, slim fit pants with lots of pockets that look great.  as many people commented, do order a size up from your normal size; i normally wear xs regular and ordered a s regular in this style and they fit perfect.  i will be buying more great quality & style but not what i was looking for personally! look exactly as pictured. i was worried about the sizing but they actually were a bit big and i had to use the drawstring. not overly huge or too small!<br />they fit well and have lots of room.<br />i am about 5\\'6&#34; and they came to the middle of my calf so they weren\\'t exactly pants but still nice. love these work pants just fit alittle small i ordered a medium , sent back to get a large the material is of great quality.  the elastic waist was made a little too tight. if you are on the tall side expect that the length may be too short (i\\'m 5\\'7 and they come to my ankles) but the fit is true to size. my size  fit perfectly. i love it i purchased 2 of these for my hiking trip and they are absolutely amazing. warm & comfortable. some day i use them as tights under a long top and they look great as well. seem very durable and presume will last me for years. i love this fabric, it\\'s what i like in capri pants, the pants fit good, even though i\\'m in the process of losing weight, for now they\\'re my size--my mid section is not small, so if you have a fairly large midsection, these should work for you. they are comfortable. i will look for more colors. i\\'m pleased with the purchase. these are exactly what i was looking for.  nice texture.  the fabric isn\\'t too thin.  they have pockets. they\\'re not too short. i bought these pants looking for this style without wanting to spend 70 to 80 bucks on one pair of &#34;yoga&#34; pants. apparently if it\\'s yoga anything, it means expensive. i wasn\\'t expecting these to fit, just because i always have to return things when i order online cause the fit is not right, but i was super excited because they did and i didn\\'t have to return these. they seem like a solid pair of pants and the size is pretty on target. i just wish that they were a tad more wide leg from top to bottom but that\\'s just my personal preference. all in all it\\'s aces these pants are soft soft soft and drape nicely. i purchased the 2x.  i am 6 ft tall and 260 lbs. thankfully, the inseam of 31\\\\\\\\\", as described, means 31\\\\\\\\\". these fit me perfectly. so soft and cool to the touch.<br /><br />drawback: the way these drape mean you either need to wear it with a tunic or with a pair of undies that dont show lines, or go without the undies.  serious pantyline issue.<br /><br />follow-up:  my drawstring broke after 2 washes and line dry.  will still wear.  i think i can get a sturdier drawstring in them. it was nice but the top ran alittle small. but overall it was fast and comfy . comfortable to work out in. it was good love these pants, got them in black color awhile ago, and decided to get in different color as well cause they\\'re really comfy and fit perfectly. a huge plus is that i received my order few days before expected. thank you fit perfectly, love it. so good!! got the job done for a halloween costume - but not suitable for everyday wear (and not just because it\\'s seventiestastic) love these pants. it\\'s so hard to find white pants that make you look good. i wear it with a boxy black tiger waist length sweater and black heels (believe it or not, i think heels are coming back, and legging jeans look great with heels. the material is soft and just enough spandex.  they are very roomy at the waist.  they wash and dry great. i have been looking for a well made and cute-fitting pair of linen pants since i wore my last pair to death. after reading the reviews of these i was a little wary of the sizing since most said these ran small. i always wear a small so i went with my instincts and got a small. im really glad i did.<br />i am a small person; 5\\'1&#34; and 105 lbs (though im 18 weeks pregnant right now so im a little bigger). i was looking for a comfortable pair of linen pants that i could wear during my pregnancy and after. these are perfect due to the double button on top and drawstring. i can only button one of the buttons and use the drawstring to keep them up then after i have the baby they will fit perfectly.<br />these pants are made very well and have an adorable fit. i really like the wide leg as well as the drawstring around the ankle portion- very cute touch. unfortunately for me (being on the shorter side) these pants are very long. usually when i get a small in pants they are long on me but these are very long. i am going to have to take them in and shortened which will remove the cute drawstring at the bottom, but i rather they fit length wise.<br />other than the length, for me, i adore these pants. they fit very well and are sturdy yet light weight and very comfortable. most reviews i read on here said that these pants run small but they fit me the same as all the other pants ive bought that are smalls. the price is great for such well made and adorable pants. shipping was also easy and quick. im definitely going to get at least one more pair of these pants in another color. great shorts! i got a large and i am about 5\\'5 140lbs! they are about upper half thigh length. great product,  highly recommend! comfortable! cute! comfy! stylish! the pattern is even more beautiful in person. i\\'m headed back to the site to purchase more colors! the pattern looks almost raised from a distance and is truly striking. i am an average height woman and purchased the size large to make sure they were long enough for my legs. if you are shorter than 5\\'7 the large is going to be really long. they fit just as you would expect. these pants have enough stretch if you are a little shorter you could purchase a smaller size for length and still fit them. great product! see you! i\\'m off to get more colors! good quality.i should have gotten the small. i assumed they would shrink in the wash, but they didn\\'t. excellent fit. very comfortable. i love these pants. this are just what i needed for summer and the fit was perfect.  the color is nice for summer as it reminds me of a swimming pool.  i would order these again. my daughter loves these.  i got a size large.  she had a baby 4 months ago and these are perfect for the post-baby body.  they do an amazing job hiding the &#34;muffin top&#34; syndrome:) seller is great.  very prompt delivery.  and these are as described.  very comfortable and cool to wear inside house or even out in backyard.  would definitely purchase from this seller again.  fabric is thin and is just what i wanted for the summer heat.  bought another pair already. fit good but wishes i would have gotten a bigger size i get alot of complements when i wear these pants. makes my butt look sexy, which it is lol. they are stretch fit. my husband choose this pants for me and amazingly they fit and look great<br /><br />it´s comfortable, great fabric, fits great and i loved it<br /><br />will purchase more soon love love these pants!! super comfy and cute. they run true to size. i am 5\\'7&#34; with long legs and the length is perfect!! i can never find pants long enough so i was pleasantly surprised!! i have 3 pairs now! super comfy. i ordered a large and i wear size 10 pants and they fit great it really is one size fits all :) love these pants very comfortable. but have to order a size bigger being that the pants run small. i am very pleased with this item. so comfortable and well fitting and the color is great. very comfortable. i\\'m size 8, and i got the large because i wanted these for around the house, not to fit too snugly. i am really happy that they are the perfect length, 32-33 inseam. i could probably wear the medium no problem, but the large cling without being tight, and that is perfect for me. so many compliments!!! legs don\\'t creep up like others do. love them good good leg length.  could be a little longer.  i am 5\\'11&#34;.  i am pretty sure these got washed and dried on hot so i am buying another pair to see if they are long enogh these are so very comfortable. the linen is gorgeous and high quality. i love stretch top waist. only problem is they are very long! i\\'m only 5\\'5&#34; so i have to hem about 4 inches. i love them though product arrived on time and in perfect condition. sizing was relatively accurate with nothing too noticeable. fabric was soft and durable. 10/10 recommend. very beautiful. love it awesome love it! these pants are soft, flowy, and very comfortable. they also look beautiful and i can wear them to work with a dressier top. wonderful pants! i read the reviews that these run small but dismissed it that maybe they ordered the wrong size. i am 135 lbs. 5\\' 6&#34; fit and always wear a size 4 top so i got a small. they do run tight under the arm and my first thought was oh no this is a junior fit. but i\\'ve had them on awhile now and i love them. they are the only pajamas that i don\\'t feel like i look frumpy in! i really like it overall.<br />i am a us size 6 usually, but looking at the other reviews, i ended up getting the largest size, a size 12. i was hoping i could have the shorts a little more high waisted and have the shirt sleeves a little loose and go over my chest. i am 5\\'4.5&#34; and 135 lbs with a 34d, for reference.<br />however, the pattern is different than the picture given, the material is a little see through, and i had some loose threads in the seems.<br />other than that, super good price, it\\'s still cute, and because i ordered the biggest size, it fits nice and relaxed. great fit and fast delivery. very comfortable! really great! quality, price, and size were fantastic! %100 cotton, sturdy fabric yet breathable. took a little longer to get than other items usually take because it came from so far away but eta was accurate, totally worth it. came with a cute little note about the seller, mother, father, and daughter business. they are comfortable and traveled well and they look nice. i bought these pants for work, business casual. they are perfect for work, but the material is rather on the thin side. being that i live in a cold weather climate 3-4 months out of the year,these pants will have to wait until the warmer weather arrives.<br />they fit as they should, and the tall length is perfect. i\\'m not a big fan of the \\'lines\\' down the middle, but i was having a hard time finding my size and length in black, so i kind of settled for this pair. i love these pants, i had to buy three in different colors. fits great love it this is my favorite brand and style. loads of pockets for supplies.  love them! i just wish they had better sale prices for size i need. i\\'m glad i read the review on this, b/c someone said they run big. normally i wear a medium (b/c i\\'m a size 8 in most pants). but i\\'m glad i got the small, and it fits great. soft and comfortable. cute casual outfit. however, it fits more like an extra large.....i purchased a large. i am a 5\\'5 and weigh about 135 pounds.  i am relatively muscular so it can be hard finding pants to fit right, especially in the butt and thighs.  i typically wear a 5/6 or 7/8, so i purchased the xxl and they fit perfect.  they are super comfortable and i absolutely love them!  they shipped soon after my purchase and arrived 9 days after (shipping from china to california).  i will definitely be buying more!!! so comfy, they are great for working out or to wear around the house on lazy days. i have even slept with them because of how comfortable they are. buy them, just buy them! you won\\'t regret it. i got a pair the of black and pink, all black, all navy blue and love all of them. they for perfectly, shipping didn\\'t take as long as expected. overall was very satisfied. my wife loves these.  she says they are the softest, most comfortable pajamas she has ever owned.  they were given as just an &#34;extra&#34; christmas present but have turned out to be the hit of the season.  so pajamas topped jewelry this christmas......if i had only known. comfy. great price for product. i love these pants!!! i am 5\\'2 and they fit perfectly. they have elastic at the bottom, so if i were taller or an inch shorter, they would also work out just fine! these pants are great with tunics. smooth, gently shape hugging, seems to smooth out the bulges! love that! such a cute belt! i wear this with my scrubs so that i have something to attach my radio to. love these pants, very comfy and great price! i just got two more pairs. they are a bit long on me, i\\'m 5ft 5 1/2 inches. the material is very thin and lite weight. fits perfectly. i\\'m 5\\'0 ft tall 103 lbs and bought the medium size.  the quality is ok.  it\\'s more of a skinny jeans type pants and it\\'s pretty good quality for the money you pay ($8). i think i\\'ll buy more. love this! it helps elongate my legs and makes me look slimmer too! this is what i\\'m looking for. the only scrub pants i will wear! so comfy. when i first pulled this out of the bag when they came i looked at them and thought.. oh my. these are too small. but then i put them on and somehow they fit perfectly!!! i just luv them. so.. i went and bought the charcoal and black ones. they sent me the wrong pair.. but refunded my money and just let me keep the other ones. very nice company.. and very nice yoga/lounge pants. would highly recommend. awesome!!! elegant! comfy! nice inseams length, i am 5\\'9 most pant are to short for me. but with these i can even we are a high heel!! also super fast shipping!!! ordered on wednesday, received shipping confirmation within 2 hour and by saturday i had them on me!! thank you so much! i am more than pleased with these pants. they fit nicely everywhere and very flattering too. the only thing is that they are a little too long-if you have long legs, you will totally rock this otherwise no biggie as that can be easily fixed. i am 5\\'4, around 110lbs and bought the small one. smart choice. so happy that i have nice fitting comfortable yoga clothes again! will buy more in different colors in the future! fit as expected, and is very comfortable. great product! nice pants. very flattering. excellent i love these pants . very comfortable wonderful fitting pants these fit perfectly. i am 5\\'8 and they are plenty long.  they are soft but very thick.  definitely winter running pants or lounging pants. nice support waist band and bootcut style.  i would buy again.  the only reason for the 4 star is because they are thicker than what i expected.  happy customer. i think the material is a thick linen. it\\'s rather heavy for wear. this maybe fulfilled by amazon (thank heavens, for that!); but came from asia. they have a habit of not including laundry care and material identification on their garments. with that said, this pair is functional, nicely designed though they need to improve the quality of their sewing. there is a lot of loose threads. i was afraid to just snip them away. my seamstress friend pulled them through the seams and knotted them from the inside. after all that, it fits well on me. high price is acceptable for quality of material; not for craftsmanship. will keep it. it\\'s good for bumming around town. i love the pants i got a lot of complements definitely worth buying. put it together with a long sleeve then tuck it in they\\'re comfortable, fit well, size up if you have hips or a butt, and wash pretty well. the stretchiness of the waistband, while forgiving and comfortable, does slide down continually throughout the day so thats a little annoying but i expected as much. i would buy again. i love the fact that it was nice and lose, but i am 5\\'1 so it was really long for me. perfect love the pants it has a very unique look and i love it.  it fits well so i ordered another. item as described; true to size. loved my harem pants love these pants. being a bartender, i need back pockets which are rare on leggings was quite surprised.  it was much nicer than i expected. received several compliments. not sure yet how will wash and have only worn once so far so that is reason i\\'m only giving it 4 stars. just got them today. i tried them on and they were a perfect fit. i love these. very comfortable, nice material - stretchy but not too much. sometimes i find it difficult to find this style where it isn\\'t too stretchy. it fits perfect. shorter than boy shorts. fits great very comfortable not quite the pink i was expecting. but i wear them and they fit perfectly. very comfortable! love this romper! good fit, nice material, comfortable. i ordered one in both colors. if they had more color options i would probable get them all!! my waist is a bit small for the med-large, no fault of theirs everything else fit perfectly i absolutely love these pants. i like the zara style also, but these lindseys are more comfortable with the added back pockets. very comfortable with nice fit. a few of my coworkers have mentioned these pants as being the most comfortable scrubs so i had to find out myself. the flexible soft fabric is so comfortable and flattering even for plus size! i will be ordering more! i feel pritty i am very petite, (4 feet 9 inches), so i did have to hem these after i received them, but the overall fit is very comfortable. the material is light-weight, there is no pinching or squeezing of any type, and it is form-fitting.<br /><br />these are suitable for wearing out in public.<br /><br />overall, these are great for lounging or exercising (at home). very comfortable and soft purchased this as a gift for future sister-in-law and she love it. great buy as expected. i love the material and quality of these pants! will definitely purchase again. these look really cute on i\\'m a size 14 and they fit great i will buy more for sure.  very comfy.  long cuz i\\'m short, but i am used to that.  ha ha speedy delivery. i am pleased! great pants. seems to be legit &#34;pink&#34; brand, no knock-off. fits good, delivered fast, great quality product. she gets her pink yoga pants, and i get her representing my favorite team.... win/win if you ask me i love these but they are very long. i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; and i had to cut off most of the red which was a shame. i still love them though. the fit/material is great and when they are stretched the color/pattern doesn\\'t fade,  fyi the elastic on the waist is a little tight and i wear a size 4 i got a small today and tried it on right away.  i\\'m 5\\' 3&#34; and weighs about 130.  i layered this under my thin training pants and feel very warm in the harsh minnesota weather.  i\\'m writing this review while i\\'m visiting another one!  i\\'m very satisfied! great price, fast delivery and perfect fit. i just love this yoga sport wear for the quality and fit - most important features for me. i\\'d recommend it to anybody who is into yoga. you get more for the money with this model. i was offered these jeans to try in exchange for an honest review.  i love wide leg jeans, so these are just my style.  i received these and they look exactly like the picture.  the material is nice, not stiff or rough and i really like the design.<br /><br />how did they fit?  these run small in my opinion.  i normally wear a 8/10 medium, so i got these in a 10.  i really had to struggle to get these on.  but after some stretching in the jeans and pulling on the fabric and promises to myself to go to the gym - i finally got them on. whoooo hooooo!!! but - wait!  i couldn\\'t fasten them because there was no button hole :-(<br /><br />there was a threaded out place for the hole, i contacted the seller and they informed me that that is how you know the item is new and never worn.  this is easily fixed by making the hole in the threaded area!<br /><br />i like these jeans, they are still a little snug. if i had a do-over i would get them a size bigger. i really liked the fit of these jeans through the body (although i didn\\'t think they were any better in quality than gloria vasnderbilt\\'s jeans) and i would have kept them but they were about 3 inches too long (and i am 5\\'8\\\\\\\\\".  i didn\\'t want to spend more money to have them hemmed. i like the pants, it was a large ,but the large didn\\'t fit well, they were kind of tight than the fit for larges that i usually wear. feels and looks great. wrinkle thoughs and i don\\'t like ironing.  it looks very elegant. love koi brand my favorite style are the cargo pant but enjoyed the change of pant style. used this for an orange is the new black halloween costume, worked great. i really like these pants, but i think they run a little bit small.  i tend to wear between a 2x-3x, but decided to get a 3x for a little extra room for yoga stretches.  thank goodness i did, because they fit like a 2x. other than that, they feel great and wash up well. i will gladly buy more of these pants, but always a size up. absolutely in love. i will get another  colour soon awesome loved them so much i bought a second pair i love these pants!  i\\'m 6 months pregnant and am able to wear these pants to work.  i love how soft they are!  i am normally a &#34;regular&#34; size at 5\\'08&#34;, but in these i wear a &#34;long&#34;. grey\\'s anatomy is great quality and very comfortable. these camo pants are very cute. i usually wear a 4/5/6 depending on the brand and time of the month, so based on the asian sizing and reviews, i ordered these in a size xl/30 (us 8) to be safe.  unfortunately, the xl fits a bit too loose for what i wanted (rear is especially baggy), so i\\'m sending them back and have just ordered a l/29 (us 6) that will be here next week.<br /><br />aside from the sizing challenges, i really like the look and fit of these. they remind me of a slightly more feminine version of my army bdu pants from 15 years ago.  there are drawstrings at both the waist and ankles. the material feels sturdy, but comfortable. it lays nicely against the skin and the only bulky parts are the cargo pockets.  i\\'m 5\\'2\\\\\\\\\"/118 lbs and these are about 4\\\\\\\\\" too long for me (they touch the floor i stand on my tip-toes). i\\'m hoping the smaller size will be slightly shorter in the legs, but if not - they still work ok with boots or thicker sole shoes.<br /><br />i\\'d originally ordered these for a combat themed halloween costume, but i like them so much that i\\'m sure i\\'ll wear them for casual/outdoor activities on a regular basis. seems quality fabric and cool look the overalls were very much pleasant to me! ! ! in case of my parameters 34/26/34 and average height it sat down perfectly! ! ! i ordered the size s and it so good! length of trousers is ideal, the waist is on a place, quality of sawing and fabric good, looks on me as on the picture! the single shortcoming - its transparency and a section on a back - i think what bh is possible to dress under it - but it is visible on the picture and at the expense of it the model is very interesting! ! ! i am happy - excellent summer option! ! ! i like the good quality product. the stuff is very nice.fit was perfect and the styling is superb.quality worth the price.the seller  packed it very beautifully. cute looks as described and pictured. nice fit true to size. great value for the price, not super study so dry clean or hand wash if required. these are knockoffs, so if you are expecting bm quality  you are going to be sad. but these are still pretty darn good. these are great. i ordered the first pair a size larger because of reviews saying they were too small, so when i got them they were very loose. these i ordered my regular size and they fit great! i ordered these because i sometimes have problems with elastic on undergarments.  these are very nice fabric, very soft, and fit just as expected.  you can certainly use them under garments, or as a nice cool bottom for pajamas! fits fine on me. these are wonderful and very comfortable.  i wear them to work and play.  they look great with just about anything!! very easy to stretch out. comfy feeling pants are just what i wanted.  they fit good and are made of a good quality material.  i would not hesitate to order them again. very soft on the skin. washes well. was very long when it arrived. cut off a few inches and sewed it up. i purposely ordered xl because the reviews all said it runs &#34;very small&#34;. i have thicker calves & thighs, so it\\'s cool if the waist is a titch big; i can always wear a belt. still happy with it! super fun and cute! these pants are very comfortable and light; however, they do run a little large. i loved it i was actually impressed! for the price i paid i wondered how good they could really be? the pants were comfortable, light weight and held up all day. i wore these for 10 hours and they were as nice when i took them off as when i put them on. i have heard that a lot of palazzo pants stretch through out the day and start to drag under ones feet. i walked several miles when i wore these (and was in and out of my car many times) and they held up wonderfully. the waist continued to lay nice and there was no bunching or stretching.  my only negative would be that the fabric isn\\'t my top choice. there is nothing wrong with it, just not &#34;top quality&#34;. however i would still recommend these pants for someone working in a professional career, going to a special event, nice dinner, etc. in love! these are the only scrub pants i wear now! arrived in 2 days of ordering, nice quality material for the price. id definately order again! a lot smaller than unexpected. they were very very tight. they will work just because i don\\'t won\\'t to deal with the hassle of returning then and a xxl would probably not have the compression. great feel. seems to be made of good quality so far. i\\'m a pretty big guy but i loved these pants so much, they fit as expected and look very &#34;hip&#34; perfect for the summer time! this is my 2nd pair that i\\'ve bought, i highly suggest these!!! these pants are awesome. as comfy as a pair of sweatpants.  so much better then the carhartt womens double front pants. i bought these for my granddaughter.  she picked them out so i knew she\\'d like them.  they look really good on her and she said they\\'re very comfortble i wear 10-12 and the large fits perfectly. the material is soft and comfortable. as with all white pants you need to wear white/flesh colored underwear but that is expected.  the material isn\\'t thin or see through as is often the problem with white pants. i love it, it fits perfectly! these pants fit great. i am half way through and not too big yet, so i\\'m curious to see how they fit the later on pregnancy goes. i could see them becoming hard to hold up on the back side, as they fall a little bit now. over all nice fit through the legs and perfect length to wear with flats. material just a little too thin. these are great pants. so glad they are back in style! i am 63 & i wore them back in early 70\\'s. i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; 118lbs so these were long then & long now. you can cut then with sharp shears & no hemming they won\\'t hang, they don\\'t frey either. we short girls tied them in a knot & made genie pants out of them! my fiancé prefers them tied & worn with heels, so i don\\'t cut mine. so comfortable, i have 3 pair! fiancé bought 1st pair he thought they were sexy. i have never received more compliments on leggings ever in my life! these fit perfect and they are so stinking cool looking! thanks! great pack! i use them all the time for yoga and household lounging/cleaning. fit like a glove. they can be a bit sheer after a few washes. also the pack is a pair of very efficient colours but the navy is more blue navy than dark navy. would recommend maybe i am too used to two-day shipping, but two weeks seems excessive, especially when another company got the same pants in a different color in three days.  i love the pants, they are so soft when they are washed but feel like they can take a long shift.  i will definitely order more and more of these pants, but will do my best to avoid this particular amazon store. while i normally wear a size medium i ended up ordering a large and absolutely love how these lounge pants fit.  (they\\'re 100% cotton so i\\'m guessing they\\'ll shrink some).  they\\'re super comfortable, warm without making me sweat, and look great.<br /><br />most of the flannel pants i\\'ve bought have been heavy but these are perfect for spring/summer and paired with a white or colored tshirt are great for just lounging around the house or that period between work and bedtime (when it\\'s inappropriate to run around the house naked in front of kids :). the best leggings! i really like them, they\\'re comfortable and fit perfect, and the print isnt awfully bright, its actually pretty cool! running in them was fun, and they are all cotton so you dont have to worry about a sweat flood in the legs when you run/workout very nice great work out pants i love these!! only issue is they are slightly tighter than i expected. still, love them. i get loads of compliments whenever i wear them. comfortable, shiny and colorful. love them. great quality, i look very nice wearing them. color is great. i wish they come in more colors .... perfect fit and nice medium weight. not too heavy. like all the pockets. color just as shown. glad i ordered three!!! nice pants, just didn\\'t like the fit.  i have returned them for reimbursement. i bought this in small and they arrived exactly as pictured. i ordered a couple of different allegra k items and this is only one of the 5 i purchased. the pants fit just a smidge too big but not enough to really complain about. they could possibly shrink a little and if they do fine and if they don\\'t fine. for reference i am 5\\'5&#34; and 110 lbs. the skull design is made of some sort of pleather....not really the highest quality pleather either but i am not going to complain. worst case scenario is if it falls to pieces after a few washings i could probably find some sort of lace patterned skull design and sew it on as a replacement. as always make sure you wash your clothes like this in cold water, delicate cyle and hang to dry. your clothes will last soooo much longer, even if they are cheaper quality. i wouldn\\'t hesitate to order more stuff from this line. super comfy! absolutely love these pants. they fit perfectly, are incredibly comfortable, and frequently complimented. very well-made cotton pants are cut to fit a petite frame.  it\\'s so great to find something sewn correctly with well finished seams and a perfect length (xs has 27&#34; inseam).  calves fit snugly.  color is called apricot, but i figured from the photo that it would be more like a caramel color, which it is.  looks great with sandals and also tucked into boots.  just watch out for the conical metal studs at the pockets.  they\\'re a bit sharp. very good. great lounge pants. super soft. nice fit & length. washes well. no shrinking. great fun pattern. would buy from this seller again. very pleased with purchase. the pants feel great my mom is hemming it for me. the leggings are too long but i like the pants so far! just perfect i am 5\\'9&#34; 200lbs and the xl fit good but had room. i could have ordered a large and they would probably fit too. they\\'re stretchy. are they a little thin? yes but totally comfy! are they a little long? yes but it\\'s better than being short! these would fit a 5\\'11&#34; woman perfect. i\\'m going to order another pair in large...i like them that much. i have received lot of compliments on them & their unique pattern. definitely worth the price. sooooooo comfortable! i\\'m an american size 3/4 or small in jeans (27\\\\\\\\\" natural waist, 34\\\\\\\\\" hip.) in light cotton pants/slacks i tend to fit in even smaller sizes. but i ordered these cargos in a size large based on other reviews. i\\'m glad i did as they are just roomy enough to comfortably move around in and don\\'t look too big.<br /><br />  i ordered them as work pants and they will work well with all the pockets for what i do. but i wish the material were a little more durable feeling (thicker or rip-stop) as i often have to climb over barbed-wire fence and these feel like they could rip easily if snagged or worn a lot--but i haven\\'t field tested them yet so they may hold up better than expected. i also wish the butt pockets were a little closer together (they are strangely wide set but i have a small butt so its not too horrible,) that the leg was more fitted to the knee and that the leg opening was wider/more flared to fit better over hiking boots. they also seem to wrinkle/stretch quickly.<br /><br />  i have been looking for years and am yet to find hiking/cargo pants for women that are thick, durable and stylish/fitted--it\\'s either one or the other. why!!? love it  just follow the chart and you&#34;ll be good bought these because thought for the price, can\\'t go wrong. they feel great and were the right size for what i ordered. i absolutely love these pants! so hard to find linen pants that fit good on curvy women. i\\'m a size large, the large fit but after a few times wearing it, they stretched out so i also got a medium. i have them in three colors now :) love them love them.  rides low on hips.. almost too low..attracts lint.. love these. very comfy and usually noone else has anything like them.can dress them up with big heels or funk them up with sneakers or booties i chose these pants because of all the pockets and fit  already have a pair wash very well as funds permit will change out all of my scrub pants for these tiny bit small, but once i wear them for a bit they stretch and are comfortable. i bought a large, and i\\'m 5\\' 5&#34;, 150 lbs. love these pants! fit wonderful and they are soft!\\' i bought 2 more pair. they fit great to size. they also have this awesome soft material! i got so many compliments ! i absolutely love them i love these pants! they are so cute and comfy and fit really well. though they are a tiny bit long on me because i\\'m only 5\\'3&#34; but i don\\'t mind. definitely going to buy more pants like these! nice product but seemed to run small. i will be returning this pair due to fit issues, but shipping was very fast and i plan to buy from again. i like bike shorts to come lower than these do, so i wear these under my regular bike shorts. exactly what i was looking for and got what i was  hoping for . they fit, but are too long.  i am having them<br />shortened. these fit exquisitely. the material is soft, light and flowy just the way i wanted them to be. i\\'ve searched several stores for these type of pants and i haven\\'t found a pair to compare to these yet. i\\'ve had them for a few months now and i\\'m still loving them.  they are well made, i just can\\'t say enough about them. i don\\'t generally buy clothes online but i really wanted these. also make note that these seem to be tailored to taller people (which i am 5\\'8&#34;) and for my height they are a perfect fit, and that is a hard shoe to fill. i have ordered these pants for several years now and find that they don\\'t fade and fit well. not exceptionally soft but very durable. arrived on time and faster than expected. tried on set right out of package to check the fit. ordered a large. bottoms fit perfectly. top seemed to be more of an x-large size fit. material is very soft and light weight. overall i am happy with my purchase. first off i wanna say i got these on my doorstep a whole week before the estimated arrival date. talk about super fast shipping! they fit great. i ordered these in a small, im five feet tall and 100 pounds. they are a little long on me but as stated im pretty short. in heels they would be fine though, and i planned on wearing them with heals. they are stretchy and well made and look great on! very dressy. i got them in the grey color so i could pair them with everything. im very happy with these. i wore them to work as soon as i got them and got lots of compliments! you cant go wrong with these! i have added two photos to show how they look and fit on me.<br />i received this item at a discount in exchange for my review but the opinions are mine abit larger than i expected but very comfortable! i am a 12-14. the medium is a little snug but a large would\\'ve been too big. great yoga pants fit is perfect i always buy the same kind from here. i\\'m 5\\'3 and a small they\\'re a little long but not as bad as most pants are. these are very comfortable pajamas to sleep and lounge in. they are the first pajamas i grab when i open my dresser drawer so they must be me favorites. it fits me well, the cloth is good for summer since it\\'s the lighter one. i got it just on time. they\\'re cute and seem to be made okay for a made in china product. the other reviews said to order a size up. i am normally a 6 and ordered an 8, and they were too big for me. i couldn\\'t make them work, and i had to return it for a smaller size. quality seems decent though. adorable ! these pants were recommended to me and they are both cute and comfortable. i\\'m also only 5\\'3&#34; and thought i\\'d have to shorten them since they don\\'t come in petite but in heels, they are a perfect length. very happy! these pants are my new favorite go-to\\'s when i need something versatile that i can dress up or down, for work, evening, any occasion! they are very comfortable and flattering, and work well with flats or heels, and the smooth polyester/spandex blend plays better (not as clingy or linty) with any fabric worn on top than similar pants i have worn in a cotton knit. these are loose, comfortable pants. i had ordered this before so i knew what they should be love these pants and the fit is wonderful! i love them! my mom loved these. well made. great jeans, feel like leggings, i love them, but you do have to order them small, because they run large.<br />other then that i love them, they are so nice and snug around the calf  and ankles.... perfect for boots. i bought these for my wife. she loves them,. they fit and look great. they work well for her at the range. perfect i am very happy very nice comftable pants lovely pants, did come as described and within reasonable time, but did not fit me every well personally.... however the vendor was more then helpful in my return of this item and went above and beyond customer satisfacton. would purchase from again! thank you! i got a size small and they fit perfect. i love the elastic wait. i am 5\\'6 so they are a bit high but with a pair of boots who will know? i love the outfit. i ordered the red. it fits an average person 5\\'3-5\\'4&#34;\\', size 4-6, bra cup maximum c only if you want to tie it up. i let mine loose and wear a black fitted t-shirt. so, there is no problem if your chest is bigger. actually it looks nicer untied in my opinion. it makes me look skinny and very flattering. the style is very good deisgn. the quaility is well-made. in fact you can wear this outside to create a unique style. very cute and feminine! i am thinking about getting the purple pants.the seller sells the pants separately. i do not need thet top. i love the pants. i\\'m thrilled with the way these pants looked! i did have to lace them up but the ribbons were long enough to do so that came with the pants. i\\'m 5\\'9&#34; and 125lbs so i was already expecting the pants to be too short (all pants are normally) but they fit perfect everywhere else. one downfall is that the lacing on one of the legs came with a little rip in it. awesome! got a size medium and i\\'m 4\\'9 and 125 pounds an they are perfect!! so soft and they look so nice! pretty we\\'ll made they haven\\'t lost there fitting. i will be purchesing more! other reviews talked about missing the button hole, but mine had it! i love these shorts, especially for the price i payed for them! i definitely recommend these! great fit and very comfortable stretchy material, fits just about any size! looks great on, very trendy! love it and can\\'t wait to wear it! loves these pants! nice fabric and really light and comfy. i love it very confortable and nice great swim pants.they fit as expected. i took them on a raft trip down the grand canyon and they were very comfortable, dried out quickly and held up well. would order again. i love them. look good and they are confi the fit is perfect but the fabric through me off in the picture.<br />its not even mentioned in the description that its velour but its very comfortable. look great very thin material. looks nice but is see thru. the front portion of the shorts that look like upside triangles is not made for thick thighs. not tight fitting at all. not recommended for big chest. i was sent the wrong waist band. i wanted to smooth band not the scrunchy band in the same orange galaxy style but still like it. the leggings are thin and a little see through so choose your underwear wisely but considering the cheap price i\\'m very happy. i\\'ve paid much more for worse leggings but these are great. and i think i just got you a new customer today. :) [[videoid:8b5e4d317462cca674781c51383c69d2]]warm is the first words not by looks but when i traveled out doors in the cold my active legging suprisely had kept both legs cozy heated i guess we can thank the thick, elastane rich ponte knit fabric to my helping of insulation .the wide elastic waist is stretchy and has not over hugged me like other pants i wore in fact i could got a size 16 ,  it has a in leg seam to fit 5\\'\\' to 5 \\'\\' my last thoughts are its great for professional wear and from the looks and feel it will last a million fittings and washes with out fading it can be as regular everyday pants not just business wearing its machine washable and i recommened to buy more then one .<br /><br />pros: they offer a  size swap fit guarantee & unconditional 100% satisfaction guarantee so no excuse not to buy.<br /><br />cons: none.<br /><br />shipping was swift and safe plus is courtesy of bodisure !!<br /><br />disclosure:  item offered free  in exchange for a review, i\\'am open to negative and positive comment\\'s great quality. love the color and fabric. love these pants are great. i have long legs and usually wear a 16/18, and these were still a good fit in the xl. i definitely recommend them. i wanted an light weight alternative to fleece pants for walking and leisure, this is what i wanted.  washed ok. the fit on this is great, it did fit a little longer on my than shown but i am 5&#34; only 2% spandex.  i\\'m torn between the comfort of 3%, which tend to stretch out too much and 2% which is sometimes too restricting.  the trials of modern life... i\\'m giving 4 stars because i\\'ve really liked their products and have worn them for quite sometime. i bought a large pair as i always do threw them and apparently they changed how they are made. the length in the legs now are far to long and i am constantly pulling them up as they sag in the crotch. i wish the reasoning was because i lost 20lbs but that is not the case. so again 4 stars because i have always had great luck with their products. but no 5 star as usual due to a new design. going to go order a medium right now and see how long they are in the legs and hope that will due away with the low hanging crotch good product, good quality at a good preio. delivered on the date planned and came well packaged. great scrub set! i love it and recommend this product very much! i especially like how it fits. i love the stretchy material. very comfortable and easy to move around in. i like the pockets too. these fit very good and are super comfortable. perfect to wear to work with a nice shirt or dress down for comfy wear. they are really long, but that\\'s how i like to wear them. very comfortable. nice print & material. fits me perfectly, but i am a size 6. i think it would be too small if you are a size 10 or over. i\\'ve never worn a jumpsuit before, so i wasn\\'t sure what to expect. but from looking at other reviews and pictures included, it looked better than i expected. if i were taller, this jump suit would be perfect, but i also know i\\'m smaller than the average female, so i can\\'t blame that on the clothing deign.<br /><br />i am 4\\'11 and 90 pounds. the top part fits beautifully. the bottom though does not. the pants are too long for my short legs and the bottom is baggy in the wrong places. on the plus side, it looks good on my butt.<br /><br />this jump suit would be perfect for a girl who is tall and thin, but i don\\'t blame the ill fitting on the company or the product, but rather my smaller than normal size.<br /><br />i received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. excellent quality!  i will definitely be purchasing more! just what i wanted! they fit perfect and are very comfy!  i am glad i ordered two pairs. love these pants! they are perfect for working out or lounging around. i am short, 5\\'2&#34;, they are slightly long but not so long that i worry i will trip. they are made of thin, soft, stretchy material. they are not warm like sweatpants. the material is thin and breathable. i am ordering more! i love these pants! they are very comfortable! good to have if you are an active, adventerous person. i agree with some other reviews that the sizes run a little large. my natural waist is about 29\\\\\\\\\" and my hips are about 40\\\\\\\\\", the small fits me with room to add a layer underneath if i needed to. if i went by the size info provided i would need a medium. these pants have a very baggy fit that i really like. they run a little long, i\\'m only 5\\'4\\\\\\\\\", but if i tie the strings at the bottom around my ankles they don\\'t drag on the ground. i\\'ve been lookin\\' for pants like this for awhile, so happy i found them! very comfortable, a little long, though. i\\'m about average height for a woman (5\\' 2.5&#34;) and i had to cut off a good three inches of leg cuff just to keep from tripping up. love these!  got the leopard print.  received quite a few compliments when worn.  there are typical leopard pants, then there are these.  very flowing and sophisticated. really cute pair of tights. i am 5\\'2&#34; and they are a perfect length down past ankles. very bright colors. have only worn twice so far and very pleased. they came before the expected time but still took a couple weeks. i like the way it fits and it looks good on.nice material. they were way too big.  check the size chart; the 2 x is a larger size than in other stores.  i reordered a large, which fit great!  :)  just wish i didn\\'t have to pay to ship them back (they take money out of your refund). i love these pants. they fit as i expected, they arrived quickly, they look like the picture. would be 5 stars except the fabric is a little coarse and itchy for my personal preference. only a little. maybe after a couple washings they will soften up. they are great pants, exactly what i was looking for in a cargo style.  my only issue was that i read several reviews that recommending to go a size up. i wear a size us 4, and bought a size us 6, and found them too big. the return was an easy, no hassle ordeal. and i reordered a 4. these are my new favorite pants. they look pretty enough to wear with a nice top, are easy to wash and comfortable enough to work or exercise in, and go with practically everything. i wish i had four more pairs just like it. fits very well, material is very stretchy, lightweight and comfortable. i will absolutely buy another pair once these wear out. these are my new favorite leggings!! :d i love the way it fits looks nice on comfortable great fit!  nice style. the pants are not the typical girlie style and are not too tight. they have lots of pockets too. i love these pants! i\\'m 5\\'3, 155 lbs and i ordered a large due to i have a bit of a muffin top :/ (mom of 3) and they literally fit just like the picture. now, i gave them a 4 because they are extremely see through, due to the material they are. i have a heart tattooed on the side of my hip/butt area and you can totally see it, but i solved that problem, just wear leggings under them and you can\\'t see anything :) and since they are of a very comfy, lightweight material you won\\'t have to worry about getting too hot because they\\'re still breathable :) i will be ordering the cheetah pants next. oh, also, along with my order i recieved a nail file and a $5 off my next purchase voucher. very happy girl here! purchased for my wife and she loves it. fits great and very comfortable for her to wear. fit just as expected. i am a short woman at 5\\'3&#34; and am never able to find a workout pant because i walk on all of the legs.  these are perfect!!  i\\'m so happy with this purchase.  great for the gym!  they stay in place and they are breathable.  i am 140 lbs with a 30&#34; waist and the medium fits just right. the wife looks hot in these leggings! love them soooo comfy please bring back more.  perfect fit & good length.  wish you had more xsmall! arrived on time, cute, as described i love these!  so soft and very cute illustrations! as advertised and delivered as promised. super soft fabric.  a little high wasted. i will need leggings under these in the winter months.  compared to koi-lindsey, these are a little thinner fabric. good pants, good for summer and i like color. long enough for me. i am 5.10 , it so hard found it. maybe a tad bit too big.... i love these pants will def get more colors!! i hve the grey pair i received these days before expected & they fit extremely well. very, very comfortable & very long so if you are tall & need the length like i do you\\'ll love these pants. bonus, my husband loves when i wear these!! ordering more...i bought the charcoal and next im getting the black. so happy i purchased these!! these are quite large and long! i love them because i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; and always struggle with leggings coming up to my ankle and looking weird but these are very long and that works for me because i can wear them with all types of shoes. love these. love these pants! so comfy good value; comfortable; will buy again in another color. i love this drizzled paint look on these leggings to go with lots of  solid colors  in summer tops all season they are almost perfect! they are soft and comfy and breathe well in the summer heat.  my only complaint is that they are actually a little big for their size, but if i ordered another size down, they\\'d be perfect! according to the other reviews i read, i did have to go up a size larger than what i usually wear. they feel wonderful!!! i\\'m happy with these pajamas, considering how reasonably priced they were. this is a great pair of pants. i am 5\\'10, the length is perfect. as for the other reviews saying that it is too thin. i am not too sure, but when i do wear them, i wear tight spandex underneath so that mitigates the issue of thinness. must buy. still good after one wash - no shrinkage or damage. im lucky to fit in xxl in juniors. im a size large. i bought a medium in these and they are great. a size large would have been perfect, but these look fine and i know they will get loose through out the course of the day and that im going to loose more weight. as for the fabric... they have a texture in them that make them hold heat, so they are great for spring and fall. not summer. beautiful pants, look as expected. color/fit was true to the picture. i love these pants, and receive lots of compliments when i wear it i love these pants.  they are comfortable, true to size, flattering, launder well, and have quickly become a favorite.<br />these are comfortable enough to sleep in, and cute enough to wear to a movie, the mall, or even a casual dinner date!  i may have to get another pair. excellent product! comfortability reached. versatile, wear with anything. i absolutely love these wide leg maternity pants. they are so soft and comfortable. the waistband is soft and comfy too. they are so comfy that they remind me of pajamas. in fact, you can wear them as pajamas if you wanted too. i loved walking around in these. they fit perfectly. i bought the medium size with a discount and they fit great. this is the normal size i would buy whether i was pregnant or not. i love the feel and the look of these pants. i love them and i would highly recommend them to any pregnant woman. you cannot get any more comfortable than these and they look great too. second pair.  i also bought the army green ones.  i love these pants. they have a nice waist band which i enjoy.  the waist band isn\\'t a low cut, that\\'s for sure. these are wonderful soft comfortable drawstring pajama pants, and also long enough for a tall woman like me.  i love them. i love these pants fit as expected and same as the picture are very beautiful! my wife was really happy with this. however, the trousers were not fitting as expected being too tight with the bum area. these leggings are fashionable and are delivered in a timely manner. they are a nice fit and if it is cold outside they dont keep you warm like some other leggings do. these are very very sheer!! you can see everything through it lol but i still like them i\\'m wearing this with long tank tops! (: very cute lounge pants,fast servie,product was as describe,packaged well for shipment,great seller.very happy with purchase. these lounge pants were purchased for my granddaughters as a christmas gift and i know they will enjoy them, thanks. the pants are made of good linen fabric, nicely stitched, with stylish details.  i bought the mocha and it is a lovely color.  the seller\\'s description was accurate. i bought these in two different colours because i love them so much. they look like jeans, but are leggings and very comfortable to wear all day.  they wash well and hold their colour.  really good value! so love it!! i felt confident buy this! i bought these for my petite daughter who is 5\\'2, size 0-2, so the medium &#34;asian fit&#34; was ok.  keep in mind the &#34;asian fit&#34; is of course small but the proportion is different as well.  the waist on the pants are a little straighter (larger) and they run narrow through the hip and rear end.  the length and rise are like a us petite.  on another note, the quality and color look like the picture. - nice. i love these pants! the texture is amazing. definitely order size up, though. i typically wear a 20-22 and got the 3x. there was a little extra room, so i probably could have been just fine with the 2x. these pants run a little long... so if you\\'re petite, then plan on having them hemmed or don\\'t bother. having chosen these for a mother-in-law who sits in a recliner most days they fit well and were casual, but dressy enough to not be nightwear great palazzo pants - they\\'re nice, but not super nice, you know? like, i\\'d wear them out to a casual/nice dinner, but not a very dressy event. i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; ~130# and a medium fits well - they\\'re long enough i can wear with heels, but just. they\\'re short enough i could wear with flats if i wanted. the pants are slim through the leg, with a wide flare at the bottom. the top folds down nicely. the fabric is very thin which is good because it doesn\\'t add too much bulk when they\\'re folded over; but don\\'t expect these to keep you uber warm. i\\'m very satisfied with my purchase. everything was great! it is very comfortable, the material is slightly thick, and it is not see-through. there is also a pocket on one side that can fit an iphone6 with no problem. also, i am 120lbs and had no issue with the length of the straps/ties being too short. the straps are sewn into the back of the pants and are non adjustable so i can see how that might be an issue for others. however, i really like this feature because the straps will stay put and will not slide around. the only other minor thing is the color is not quite as dark as pictured (not a huge difference) but it is still a very deep and beautiful color. personally, i really love these pants and i would recommend them to others! should have ordered a medium as they are a little bit large and too long for me(i\\'m short), but i will order them again as i love the cut and feel of the material love these &#60;3 i needed them for a cosplay i was doing and they looked fantastic they fit just right very compy fit great well made although it was too small the fabric is super soft and flows nice. they are everything i\\'ve hoped for and more! i love them. the material is nice and airy so they are comfortable for the warmer weather that should be coming!  they we\\'re also comfortable when i wore them in the brisk chilly weather tonight! these are my new favorite pants! i want more of these!!!! beautifull am happy. thanks my order i love these pants. they are very comfortable. lots of stretch, yet still soft and fitting to the extent they are slimming. great for us girls with a booty. sweet pants for paintball these fit for my size, but the butt. they have the fit that many women will understand. they fit perfectly everywhere, but the rear is too short. if it weren\\'t for the wide waistband, which can be adjusted to cover, i would show more crack than a dealer.<br /><br />comfy and seem to be rather long-lasting, but ladies with booties beware and size up. a nice fit. on a little larger side but was what i expected for wide leg pants. cute & comfy. love these pants. they are very comfortable. i am 5.3 and these are just the right length with a slight heal. did not need to shorten these. they came almost two weeks before the first estimated arrival date! i am about 5\\'6&#34; and 140 pounds and while they are tight they fit perfectly!  they look just like the picture. planning on wearing them to comicon! very happy with this product! amazing fit. love the color and everything about it. the fit and the fabric are perfect. everytime i wear them i get compliments. they just feel so nice. these pants are super comfortable. slim sheek look, and have gotten many compliments on them. a great buy! worked well for a dance recital piece really cute & colorful. a little looser than i expected, but good product! love the color these pants were so much nicer then i anticipated.  they are very soft,  stretchy,  and form flattering.  i normally wear a xxl and after checking the sizing i decided to order a xxl in these as well.  i\\'m glad i did.  it\\'s hard to find pants that fit me in waist as well as length but these fit the bill.  i really liked that you can fold them over at the top or leave them alone if your taller.  at 5\\'8 i can half fold them and wear with my platform sandals.  if your a tall girl these will fit you without any issues.  great for wearing to run errands or for relaxing at home.  5 stars from me.  i received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. love these pants! they are really comfortable, well made and i love the pockets! sizing seems to run a little small on this vendor. i bought 3 pairs of these pants for my daughter. she loves them! super comfortable. we found that they were a little bit too long though. she is 5\\'2&#34; and the legs were 4 inches too long and we had to hem them a little bit. but other that that they are great. and they did not shrink in the wash. very good so many compliments on these unique and fashionable pants!! and more comfortable than i could have imagined. love them! i completely change my mind. i was too lazy to return these. i recently lost a ton of weight and now they fit beautifully and i love them. i only go out in them with my husband though cause they hug and stretch and make your butt look great! i am now a size 4, i was a size 6/7- so that gives you an idea of the sizing of these pants. i love these pants. i have them in 5 different colors! they are actual palazzo pants, un like stylezoo and 2luv, these have palazzo style legs! they fit good, i\\'m normally a 2x in american women\\'s size with this kinda material, i ordered the xl and they fit great, good stretch and good length! material is kinda thin tshirt like, but not see thru and they fall and feel nice. good for dressing up or just lounging in! these (hot for hollywood and leggings queen) are great and highly recommend pants! the color is a bit lighter then shown.  by the way, i\\'m 5\\'3 i bought a medium previously and it was very large on me.  i typically buy medium with no issues.<br />these run a bit big so i tried the small and it was perfect.<br />but 1 size smaller than usual. i love these pants! the material is good.these fit me perfectly and i am a size 3 in american pants..they are stretchy so i think it would fit up to a size 4 or 5. i\\'m also 5\\'2.5&#34; and the length is also perfect!  besides the seller finejo, these pants are great! i volunteer at a doctors office several days each week.  the doctor requested i wear scrubs with his company logo on them.  i was unsure when i ordered how well they would fit me.  when they arrived i couldn\\'t wait to find out.  to my amazement they fit me quite well. the reviews prompted me to buy the xl (5\\'9 and wear size 4 - 6) and i\\'m glad i did. the waistline and pockets are a touch big and they\\'re not quite ankle length but overall it fits nicely and looks good, esp for the price. i\\'m 5\\'11 and they fit nice.  i always worry about length but i was not disappointed, true palazzo pants....... perfect decision ever made..i loved it so much! the quality is the best, as expected, and the cloth is really nice to feel :) i love these jeans they where shipped and had them in 2 days i wear a size 17 to 18 in jeans i ordered a 3x they are perfect and just in time for fair time can\\'t wait to wear them i bought these for a gift for my mom.  she loved them but than ran a little big.  soft material and heavy for the winter!! i am however commenting based on the fact that they are for my girlfriend, and i\\'m guessing she likes them.  she normally complains bout everything, so i figured she cant complain bout a sore bottom after i got these....like &#34;that ought to shut her up&#34; well, and it has, so i would have to say just by weight and shipping and sizing alone they are worth more than diamonds.... who would have thought? sent them back and reordered in smaller size. great flowing fabric.  so comfy.  easy to dress up or down.  i wear then to church, work, and the store.  will be ordering more pairs. these look great, but they do get a little hot. they do roll down a little, but if you wear a cami tucked in them they are fine. otherwise exactly what i wanted. soft and warm. hope they wash well. fit me great at size 16. bought 2 more pair. pants fit but realized that one of the pockets had the elephants upside down while the other pocket has them right side up. love them! super comfy. i wear them to yoga and at home. the sizes run a bit small. great quality, thicker fabric and the sizing suggestions worked out great. i\\'m currently a 6 and ordered the xl/30. very comfortable. these are sooo comfy and we\\'ll made, i was surprised.  nice stiching, waist, lots of pockets, just nice pants! these yoga pants are great! they are great to wear in a hot yoga class  staying cool and dry you are not constantly rolling up the bottom of your yoga pants to cool off! as well wear them in a cooler  yoga room and stay quite comfortable. they do not wrinkle wear well and look fantastic! buy big girl arrived on time and fit/look great.  although that might not be true for every body, it works on my g/f perfectly.  she wears a size 4-6 jeans and smalls fit her great. pants fit great, defiantly need to get a few more pair👍🏼 these pants are super cute.i knew from reading reviews they were long.i will have them hemmed.i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; so way too long for me. this is so soft and fits well. it took awhile to get here as it came from overseas but well worth the wait. it is a dress up romper and i am planning to wear it on many occasions with a smile on my face!!!

looks like the picture love love them! order a size smaller and they\\'ll be perfect. quality material. 5 stars love these pants! look just as nice in person! the outfit is a little big but  i love it still because i look good in it. cool item i purchased the mint band ones, and i love them, however, bending over in them at all and anyone will be able to know what color underwear you have on. at first when i got these they looked very small but they stretch like crazy! i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; and 140 lbs and they fit me perfectly, they seem like they could stretch even farther too! overall this is a great buy and you won\\'t be disappointed comfy and soft! they are perfect and so comfy. i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; so they are a little long but they are trill great to wear. i want to live in these. great material and fit and hold up well in the wash. i get so many compliments on these and they are so comfy. would definitely buy these again. i purchased these as a gift for my mother. i wasn\\'t real sure she would like them but she absolutely loves them. she likes the fit and the fabric. she says they are so comfortable she doesn\\'t want to take them off. these are pretty great!  i was worried about buying clothes online but i was pleased with my purchase.  good fit, comfy, not see through.  they are a little longer on me than i expected but i am short.  5\\'1.5&#34;, about 119lbs and i got a small. love these pants! especially the price! would not have expected them to be so nice! i usually wear between a 4 and a 6. iborderedbthevlarge and they fit perfectly. normally i would have ordered a medium but there\\'s no way that would have fit! i bought three pairs! i ordered these pants to work out in.  there\\'s no tight binding in the waist which makes it easier to move.  they fit good but a little long but that\\'s ok with me.  i\\'m almost tempted to wear them out in public because they are so comfortable! i purchased them for a 5k that i was in &#34;hippierun&#34; but they cancelled the run and i never got and have not as yet worn them, but i loved the fit. i needed something comfortable for home and yoga.  this is perfect!  i wore it to yoga class and it was great!  the product arrived on time too. love these pants they fit very well i\\'m between a size 10-12 and these pants showed off my curves very classy!!! i loved these, comfortable material. wish they had sizes because they are big but they fit better than other one size fits all leggings i\\'ve ordered from other companies. two of my friends and i bought these, definitely going to wear them for parties! i ordered a 6 and an 8. i tend to fall between the two sizes. the 8 fit perfect. i could not get the 6 on. length was good with a 2 inch dansko heel. no pockets. can\\'t comment on quality, i have only washed once. i do air dry my pants and then steam refresh. they did not shrink. i am 5\\'6&#34; and am 130lbs. athletic build and have a butt;) prompt shipment, excellent fit, very comfortable.  now i just need to wear them regularly and see how long they last. love these. stylish and compfy. the fabric is nice. the fit is good.i do not have have fat ankles or calves so the extra is just a little too much but does not look bad to me. what i really was hoping for was a sewn in tag that specified that the material was treated for chlorine in pools and spf so that the ny parks can quit giving me a hard time. they want me to wear men\\'s swim trunks or bathing suits that are to revealing for me. never the less, they are comfortable swimwear to the beach. love these scrubs🌼 my wife is a huge deadmau5 fan and these were perfect for her! thanks again! love the fit right under by hip bone and slim through the legs. the are heavy duty on wear and tear. i have used them on long hike, thru steady rainfall , on rock crambles and rock climbing without a tear.  wish the buttons were velcro because too hard to do and undo while hiking i got these to go with the matching tunic top i have.  since the tunic hangs below the butt, who cares if they are a tad sheer!  i weigh 130lbs and am 5\\'6&#34;.  the small size fit perfect.  they don\\'t stretch, so be sure to order your size correctly.  i love everything becca! fits great these pants are perfect for travel and casual wear...perfect fit and perfect price.  my only complaint is that they don\\'t come in additional colors so that i could have a pair for each day of the week! freeeeeeedom. i loved this outfit. perfect for a party.  i got so many complements on it. cute and comfy, just tighter than i want them. i really like them haven worn them out yet tho. but definitely takes some time to put them on so plan ahead if you are wearing them out.  love them though can\\'t wait to wear love love love!!!! so comfy and fit great love love love this.  so nice.  material quality is sooooo much better than expected.  classy these are very comfortable, fit well and are just what i wanted-made well. i love them.  i\\'m 5\\'4&#34; and they\\'re the perfect length with 2 &#34; high sandals.  they look like chiffon in the picture but they\\'re gauze which is what i really wanted.  i\\'d have given them  5 stars but i\\'m sure they need hand washing and ironing.  gauze shrinks a full size in the dryer.  i have a gauze skirt & shirt. fits great i love these pants!  i wear them to my kettle bell class, where people always comment on how cute they look.  they are extremely comfortable, and fit well.  love \\'em! they fit well. very cute. they were a little more jean like than i would have like but overall they\\'re great pants. hubby did good :) they look great and i love them. they are a little tighter than i thought they would be. as the other reviews said, the sizes run large. i like the material. but i\\'m 5\\'11&#34; and the pants are too short when sitting (as they normally are for me). i wish they came in long. good price for both top and bottom. these are perfect for lounging around. they\\'re a little see-through though, so i wouldn\\'t wear a short shirt like you see in the pic unless you\\'re using it as a beach cover up. i have to wear a long shirt that covers my butt at least. and so then i throw on a belt and voila! i\\'m a pirate. j/k. bottom line, very comfortable. plenty big. nice fit! this review from mrs. mara: i love these palazzo pants. the pattern is beautiful, the pants are super-light and much more elegant than the picture shows. but one has to have very long legs (which i have!). these are quite long. one needs to fold the waist over to really get a good fit.<br /><br />i would recommend them to anyone who wants an elegant pair of palazzo pants with a dramatic pattern for parties, dancing or whatever! they are extremely comfortable. and very roomy legs, i would rather the legs be slimmer cut, it seems that the leg width is constant throughout sizes... the pants are very comfortable. more fitted than what is shown in the pictures but it hugged my legs nicely. makes my booty look phat! since i\\'m 4\\'11, it\\'s a bit long for me but that is a given. it was delivered very fast. and i got the xl/xxl, it does fit like a large. and the waist is a tab bit snug but manageable. i would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a casual/dress up pants. my only question is, do they come in different colors? they fit perfectly from waist down to calves then they r just too long but im short so thats not the pants fault. the fabric has great soft texture and launders beautifully.  the color is a softer orange...almost sherbet.  the pant fits perfectly. the quality seems very good. the color is vibrant, it is very comfortable and it stretch perfectly. the skinny pant is a perfect to wear during cold season because the fabric is thick and feels warm. it has a skinny pants look but have a comfort of a legging. however, the skinny pants emphasizes lower body fats when you wear it so better to use long top with it. i received this product at a discounted price in exchange of my honest review! bought these pants to lounge around the house, walk the dogs and go for a run in. they fit perfectly! since they are cotton they breathe well and i wont have to worry about clammy legs after a jog. also, the inseam is perfect for us smaller ladies! this is the second pair we have order and the have great color and true to size. would order again! my favorite scrub pants! i was excited that these pants were long enough! i am 5\\'11&#34; and usually wear a size 12/14 with a 34&#34; inseam. i always have a hard time finding pants that are long enough for me. these were perfect. the waist does stretch out a little with wear. i notice they are tighter after drying them. they are pretty see through too which isn\\'t a big deal with the black. i can\\'t say about other colors but i definitely wouldn\\'t buy white if it\\'s a choice! it fits perfectly. i bought this for my pregnancy and now i\\'m 28 weeks, the fold over waist helps keep my belly warm during winter! look great! fit my daughter 5\\' 2 108lb beautifully, super cute on! these pants are awesome. i keep getting compliments on them. very comfortable. fit perfectly. as expected they are most likely maternity pants with the big elastic band on the belly area. i am not pregnant, but i have been looking for a cute pair of linen white pants. the fabric isn\\'t very thick and you can see through them but that was expected with a white pant. they flair out pretty wide down by the feet but are adorable and super comfy! they fit well ! giving it 5 stars because the seller was awesome. accidentally ordered a large when it was suppose to be a medium for my girlfriend (5\\'11 and skinny). they were a fun little gift to give b/c she loves wonder woman. just what i needed. steelers colors too, for that alone this item gets 5 stars! :) the fit is super tight which i like for working out - keep that jello contained.  but it is a little too tight which doesn\\'t bother me as i\\'ve lost 48 lbs and looking to lose another 20 so they will fit lose enough eventually.<br />i hand wash & line dry (i haven\\'t read the directions on washing) just because i do not want shrinkage right now. love the style and material. fit well. love them. would buy in every color. just what i was looking for. loved them oh man i love these pants so much. they are thin, lightweight and very comfy! i love the cherokee stretch pants i wanted to try the capri pants but they don\\'t have them in the size i need you need to accomodate the bigger women my size is 16/18 every time i got to target i don\\'t see what i want i only see the smaller sizes or none at all so do you make the capri pants for the bigger women i await your response  to the bigger women in the usa i\\'m 5\\'8 and 115 lbs, so it\\'s usually hard for me to find scrubs pants that don\\'t drown me.  koi\\'s extra small tall pants fit me perfectly with plenty of room to move around in at work and not so much fabric that i\\'m tripping over all of the extra baggy fabric.  really comfortable, they\\'re great for those 12 hour shifts when you need something that you can put on and forget about. i love these. yes they are kind of big around the waist and length. i\\'m 5.3 and 107 pounds and the small are baggie though i like them like that. they are my new favorite pj pants. great fit for petite! it fit straight i think that was not sized because its too my skin next time will be soon thank i love them will be buying more love these! i just got them yesterday, but they are very comfy, plenty long (i am 5\\'9&#34;, 145 lb and can wear them with my danskos), and the fabric quality is good. not thin or cheap feeling at all. the waistband is great, several inches wide, stretchy, and soft cotton with elastic and a drawstring. it can be worn up or folded down, and either way is comfortable. a big bonus is that they can be used as maternity scrubs! i am 21 weeks along and i needed to find something that would grow with me, but it was impossible to find tall maternity scrubs in the color i needed. i decided to try these and they are wonderful! the waistband is very stretchy but wide and secure and fits right below my belly with plenty of room for expansion. the rise on these isn\\'t ridiculously high like some scrubs, and they fit just right- not so tight that it\\'s uncomfortable to move around, but not baggy at all. i am going to order another pair! it\\'s not real galaxy pic... wore these for broomball<br />kinda snug, but i\\'m tall<br />wore tights underneath so when i fall<br />everyone won\\'t see bathing suit parts and all.<br /><br />big crowd pleaser for all the heathens<br />brought out everyone\\'s inner demons<br />not what you need during contact sports,<br />but pants fit fine, a-ok reports. decent leggings for the dough but you need to wear a longer top over them or you\\'ll be giving quite the show. great sport or home pants for a tall pregnant woman! i was looking long pants, and i did not believe when i got them, they are long enough! good fabric and it is comfortable, and not expensive. my daughter will love this outfit just a little snug- probably because it is such a high waist elastic pant- it worked for what i needed them for! good quality; i like it. i\\'ll get the larger size next time. these are so soft and comfy - i had them delivered to my office and couldn\\'t resist immediately changing into them.  that\\'s how soft they are.  they were calling my name...the pattern is so cute and fun, everyone asked where they came from.  i will be buying many more pairs of these. i ordered a large i normally wear a size 4.  i\\'m 5\\'4 and weight 120lbs. they look great. thinking about getting another pair. i would recommend this product. look great! they look really small but i put them on and now i love them! great length and great look. i love them. good quality after reading the reviews i was skeptical because it seemed they were either too long, too tight, too thin etc...i ordered two pair and the black ones fit perfectly, they\\'re not too long at all; in fact, i wear them with flip flops and they don\\'t drag the ground and they\\'re actually thicker than another brand i have as these are more cotton than the others. the olive color i ordered were too tight even though they were labeled the same size as the black ones.  i\\'m sending them back to try again. normally coolibar clothing runs large and the misses xl is a perfect fit or me. not so when it came to the sizing for the coolibar upf 50+ women\\'s sun pants. the sun pants were a bit tight fitting across my tummy and hip areas. also, the color vintage navy is a dusty navy color which looks almost like a bluish gray.<br /><br />i am returning the sun pants as they do not fit as well as i would have liked.<br /><br />recommend with caveats given. the recipient couldn\\'t wear them, but is holding them until she can.  be wary of foreign sizing, especially from asia.. happy with my products nice pants, professional looking, nice creases and super good price. i love these and they fit many sizes very well! i would love to see these done in some solid colors also. for most who rated 1-2 stars, i see its because you ordered too small - that shouldn\\'t be the fault of the seller. you really need to pay attention to the size chart.  i am a size 6-8 and i purchased 6 pair in size xl ... they fit perfectly after i washed and dried them. i have a smaller waste so i needed to shrink a little for the waist but there is a draw string to pull tighter around the waist if needed; the quality and color selection is fabulous! i love the baggy feel and wrinkly look.  this is exactly what was i was looking for and absolutely delighted with my purchase. the shipping said 2-3 weeks but definitely arrived much sooner! i am a pleased customer! perfect flow pants! i love it i feel like a princess and a lot of people have the look of wanting to rip it off and run away look. comfortable these look super expensive. can\\'t believe they are only $18! nice and thick. very bad ass! love them! perfect fit; prompt delivery. item fit the description. i plan to purchase this item again in other colors if availabvle. material is a bit thinner than the other cotton pjs i am used to. but it is soft and comfortable! cannot beat the price :). will definitely buy again. i like these pants, but would warn that they are a junior fit. i wear a medium in all other brands, but this medium was snug through the hips. i can just tell its cut narrower/junior. first of all, the shipping was very fast and i just love the quality of this product.it is a bit small than i expected, so order one size up from your normal size! whenever i do yoga, i always wear this pants, which is very comfortable and smooth. i highly recommend this product if you are willing to start yoga starting tomorrow in the morning! let\\'s get in shape! i am 5\\'3 and 110lbs, thought i would need an xs but small fit perfectly. love them love these  will be buying more solid colors. i love these garter buckle leggings its very nice but its not leather :/ it looks leather which is all right! :) i purchased these slacks to wear over a cast after breaking my leg. it had no slacks that were baggy enough to slide over a cast (other than pajamas). not wanting to wear pajamas to church or the grocery store, i ordered these to wear out. they are nice - i love linen clothing. they are just a little loose on the top. i usually wear and 8 regular so i ordered the medium. they are comfy. the elastic is very soft and not tight - i went to wearing a leather tie around my waist so i could walk on the crutches without having them slide down, but i don\\'t mind that, it\\'s just nice to have a nice pair of anything that fits over an ugly cast. nice pants. long legs (i will have to shorten after wash & dry). comfortable elastic waist with ties. ties were not needed as<br />the elastic is sufficient.  they will last a long time. they are comfortable and soft which is awesome but i read that they ran a little small so i ordered a size up; and they are a little long so if you\\'re 5\\'3 be prepared for that. i should have ordered a my real size. but  these will just be my new favorite saturday pants. other than that im pleased with my purchase!  :) okay, these pants are extremely soft and comfortable. the size is smaller than i hoped, being tight on the butt and a little short, but it\\'s tolerable.<br />would buy more if they came in bigger sizes. got these for the wife as part of an anniversary gift. she loves them...and she looks great in them...got her some yoga gloves and toesless sock to match these and she looks amazing as she does her yoga...and more importantly, she loved the gift!! so...no complaints...this seller shipped it fast and it was here in no time.<br />great product, great purchase, great seller...100% positive experience!! im really picky about what i buy but ive been looking for neon green leggings everywhere i bough these with uneasy feeling thought it would be poor quality  but the quality is really good for the price it arrived right on time these are fantastic for the price. so fun to wear. great quality, and i always get compliments.  have ordered several pairs and always had great service.  several friends have purchased also, and great service i received this jumper two days early and it looks amazing!!!! the material is sooo soft i absolutely love it!!!! the only thing about it is that the pants are too long (im 5\\' ft) but other than that it is perfect! perfect. i love them love lot the color i thought it was kind of big but will probably shrink in the wash. really cute im glad i bought it. just a little long so i will bring up the hem. i look forward to using them on vacation these pants are really nice, wash well, fit well. the only fault i could find was the color, supposedly navy, but really quite a lighter blue. i don\\'t mind, but i would have preferred true navy. fit is great, love the feel. material is calotype thinner than i expected but still a great yoga pant i originally ordered a medium but they were very tight, so i sent them back and ordered a large and they fit great. they are very long but i wore them with some high heels and they look amazing! i def. recommend these pants. they feel great as well, the material is very light and airy. just what i was looking for. the pants are comfortable & fit well. i was unable to find what i wanted in the local stores so finding this on line was great. great fitting pants!! love! these are my favorite pair of scrub pants. perfect size and length! love these, soft pretty colorful summer 2013 amazing leggings fun!!! light airy material can wear in heat probably not best for cold nights!!! quick shipping!!! i bought these pants for someone as a gift. the color is much better in person than online. great quality as well. i was told they kept her warm and dry. super comfortable, great pants. nice for any occasion, need to be ironed if wearing in a more professional enviorment. love grey\\'s anatomy scrubs.  very comfortable and washes great.  never fades and is ready to wear right out of the dryer, wrinkle free.  no ironing necessary. nice must be worn under something or you can see underwear or lack of underwear.  the pattern was nice just a little to sheer. they work well and make pants look neater for work, etc.  i will recommend them to others.  i still like the ones you used to sell with velcro straps, but i could not find them on the website. i probaby could have used an xl in these pants and they are a litle bit long but i will<br />make them work.  they are just what i wanted to relax in! they fit perfectly and they are exactly what i wanted as textile (feels and looks like leather), gorgeous color (beautiful shades of light, rusty and dark brown) and model. very satisfied! i really love this pair of pants! ❤💖 it\\'s pretty comfy to wear all day but it\\'s too long for my short legs.  i\\'m five feet tall and i had to fold the bottoms three times  haha yes,  i know i am short. the color is similar to the one online just a tad deeper tone. the size i have is in 9 and it fits really good. just keep in mind,  this pant is a low rise so don\\'t purchase this if you\\'re going somewhere that requires you bending a lot.  hah or you\\'ll be showing a few things you don\\'t want to show.  overall,  i\\'m glad i made a great purchase from this seller! 😃👍 very comfy. not enough by itself on a winter day. mine was a little smaller or fitted than id hoped for which is also probably why it was a tad see through in some areas. but they are super comfy and i\\'m happy with them i love these, they are nice and breezy and fit is excellent. i love them and may order more.<br /><br />the red has a seam going between waistband to crotch in front that makes a shadow like a massive camel toe. the pants are loose in that area for me.<br /><br />if you order a lighter color or the red, you should probably plan to wear a long tshirt or tank top to cover the front part. this is my second pair of these pants which i use for fishing.  pros:  - pants run true to size according the propper size chart which i looked up on-line.  the waist has a stretch waistband incorporated on the two sides, it doesn\\'t run the entire waistband but just enough to provide some stretch.  - pants are roomy through the hip and thigh, a very comfortable fit  - lots of pockets to put things in.  i use them to put scissors, knife, rag, cell phone, etc.  the pockets are roomy but you can\\'t put a large amount of stuff in them, they don\\'t bulge like military (acu) pants  - teflon coating is great, sounds gross but the blood, etc from the fish washes right off, no staining!  - ripstop material is lightweight and functional  - the pants are lightweight but not that lightweight (meaning airy and breezy).  i imagine i\\'ll get a little hot in them during the summer.  - comes with the belt shown in the picture  cons:  - the pants are not hemmed which is good and bad.  bad because unless you know how to hem your own pants or have a handy friend, it\\'s going to cost you more to hem them.  but then for those who are an atypical height (short or tall), you\\'ll have a custom fit once hemmed.  - pants sit a little above my waist but i\\'m short (5\\'3).  would rather have them sit a little lower but they\\'re better than a men\\'s fit!  for a good, quality pair of pants, they\\'re a great value for the price. these fit great.  i am 5 foot 10 and pants usually are a bit short on me.  but if i let these ride closer to my hips than my waist they were great.  they are light weight and move well.  they are easy to wash and looked great right out of the dryer. these pants are so soft and comfy...they wash perfectly and i love them!!  i wear them so many places during this hot summer in fl. not just for exercise/yoga!  i just ordered another color. i love the colors! perfect love these pants perfect for me. i use them as palazzo pants for my garments in banner/dance ministry because i\\'m allergic to polyester and rayon is the best material for my skin. the sizing was accurate. they look good. i will be ordering them again. wish they were slightly less so i could buy one of each color or maybe multiples.<br /><br />looks lovely as you walk. i have been looking for some black  pants for some time and these fit great and since im 6 ft the length is great. i love the material i\\'m 5\\'3 106lbs 32-25-34 and they fit great.  they don\\'t appear to be see through to me as some have mentioned.  the print and design is crisp and detailed as pictured. excellent love the pants. keep getting compliments on them. absolutely loved these!! they fit great, i got lots of compliments, and they\\'re comfortable. super cute and definitely worth what i paid and more!! great buy, and would recommend them to any lady who is looking for some cute jeans!! i was expecting these to be a bit longer... i am 6\\'2&#34; and they come to just below my knees. i really like them and wear them a lot. they are comfortable and great for everyday wear. i wish that i had gotten them before we went to the beach, they would have been great to kick around in there! these are my favorite leggings! i\\'m a tall and curvy girl so i wear a size 12 but i\\'ve not had any issue with the sizing on these, they are extremely comfortable and aren\\'t see-through at all. i wear them all the time with dresses and tunics because i\\'m a little modest but i\\'m sure they wouldn\\'t show your butt even if you wore them with regular shirts. (i wear a teeshirt or sweatshirt around the house with them.) plus, i love how happy the pattern is, i always smile when i look down and see the whole universe on my legs. i would say i love these but they run too large. i am 5\\'7.5&#34; and 126 pounds and the smallest size (small) really is literally falling off all day :( but they are beautiful and the quality is quite nice for the price especially. i tried to shrink them by drying on high and they got a little better but still, too big. these work well for me. just got these pants in the mail yesterday. i love them! i am 5\\'7\\\\\\\\\" 130lbs and i ordered a large, because i hate when pants like this are too short on me. the colors are true to the picture and the fabric doesn\\'t feel as cheap as i expected. i will order these in the red color as well. fits as expected and going to be great for my cabo trip! extra tall scrubs are made of a nice cotton that barely needs ironing. size runs a bit small but love the pockets! pants fit good and are true to size. they are very stretchy. my only problem is the first day i wore them, my zipper broke. i am not too mad because i only paid around $25.00 for them. overall, i like the product and i did end up ordering every color. great for the rave! love these pants, fits perfectly. great item at great price!  looks awesome in my garden! i gave this jacket as a christmas and it was my friends favorite present.  it fits him perfectly. these are my favorite pants. they\\'re soft, warm, move with you, and look great straight out of the dryer. what more can you ask for?! the pattern is a little different from the picture but they fit like a glove...i love em!! good pants but do run very small. i dyed them for a princess jasmine costume and they worked for that. i\\'m 5\\'1, around 140 lbs and bought an xl. i have a pretty small waist and they were still borderline too small. the elastic waistband is very snug, it\\'s not a soft stretchy one. so soft! love them but geez louise you can kind of see through them so they are better worn under a long shirt or dress..unless you like your undies showing :) bought by our son for his mother... no complaints or frowns... she appears to be satisfied with this item! get it for her. better than expected. i take a small size 2 to 4 and ordered small. length is great for 5\\'8&#34; tall. pant leg touches bottom of my heel.  leg tapers out to full flare, which is expected with linen gauze fabric so the knee does not stretch out of shape.  airy, cool, woven fabric is not see through.  the style with the draw string bottom have deep front pockets and two rear patch pockets. the style in the natural color has shallow front pockets and rear faux pockets. waist sits just above or at hip bone and has stable inner liner band with draw string and decorative stitching details with a two button closure and one inner button.  this is a superior, well made pant that is true to my screen color in the cocoa.  the jade i ordered is more of an aqua or teal green but still very pretty. note there are different styles for the various colors shown. i ordered two different styles with the tailored waist and the fit is consistent. i would easily compare this pant to a $60.00 fine women\\'s shop product.  note, linen by nature will crease at the sit line but these pants do resolve with a fine mist of water. they drape nicely and are not stiff.  oh, did i mention i really like them a lot? my 6th pair, color.  will watch for additional i like the pants, however, i am an average height person and these pants are very long.  i will have to hem them to wear them. i\\'m a big fan of transition feet and these are great tights. soft, sturdy, i get a lot of use out of them. feel so good! i thought a size l would fit, but it was too small for me....i gave it to my niece and it looks very nice on her and fits.  my mistake, should have ordered a bigger size... i like my spot clothing  but i want buy another with short love them yoga work out pants fits perfect i am 5\\'3, 118lb and i ordered a small.  the length is just right. if i was 5\\'4, i would think they were too short and would want a medium.  size is just right too.  they are definitely thinner material, but for this cheap, you shouldn\\'t expect more.  perfect for around the house and quick trip to grocery store.  there is not much of a &#34;flare&#34; at the end. thats my only complaint. but, gave it away and she loves it! i purchased these pants for my 96 year old grandmother. she was delighted with the bright color and the comfortable wear of these pants. so comfy love these pants!!! i love my pants. they fit me  perfect  and the product was just like the picture. the color is great for summer fits as expected. good for long legs well made, good fit.  wife loves it. love them,they are so comfortable i wear size 10 so i bought a large. they fit great!!! the quality and material are very nice!!! i bought 3 pairs: 2 charcoal gray, and white!!! i would recommend la base women\\'s long yoga pants. just love the comfort. i am currently recovering from a broken leg and surgery, and stocked up on these comfortable, form-fitting (but not tight) casual pants. they do the job. they\\'re nothing fancy, but i wouldn\\'t expect much more for the low price. great fit for women size 10 & 12  : ) too large.. these leggings were far more different than anticipated. they are very thick and i actually love that. they are shiny just like it looks like in the picture. my only qualm, if i were to create one, is that they are incredibly long. i have pretty short legs, though. they bunch up in some areas because of that, but it\\'s really not a big deal. i love them! i love these.  the material is so soft!  they are well-made too, not cheap and shoddy.  i dont find them to be see-through.  they hold up to yoga, sleeping, general lounging, or whatever you want to wear them for.  and they are cute!<br /><br />but heed the reviews!!  these absolutely run small.  i normally wear a pants size 6-8 or medium for yoga/pajama type pants, but the xl in these pants fits me perfectly.  i\\'m glad i read the reviews and ordered the xl.  i am also pretty short-statured so i may not recommend these for very long-legged ladies, based on the fact that they fit my short legs so well.  but that may just be the nature of this style of pants!<br /><br />overall, totally recommended!  just order a size or two up. they\\'re comfortable, wear well, wash well, and were delivered quickly. they\\'re a bit long for me, but i\\'m only 5\\' 2\\'\\' so everything is long for me. if i needed another pair, i would purchase them again. love these! so incredibly comfy! great leggings! i\\'m 5\\'6 170lbs and they fit nicely! i absolutely love captain america and i wear medium sized shorts. i knew these would be tight, but when i tried them on my butt was falling out. haha. which is great if you like that sort of thing.... but if you dont, i recommend buying the next size up. the great thing is theyre very comfortable and they are also stretchy so it doesnt restrict moment. great for workouts! great for marvel/captain america fans. :) just remember what i said about size and you\\'ll be fine! perfect. wore them for the race for the cure walk. these are nice pants.  in the picture they look a little more like soft  canvas or denim, but they are really just sweat pants.  for the price they are  decent quality and fit well. nice but too small for me. i gave to a family member. very good because i,m short and overweight, it was a poor fit.  much too long.  i,m 5&#34;2.  i also didnt realize these pants had no pocket, which i needed.  the material did feel quite comfortable though.  i returned them, of course. silky, cute and comfy.  must have multipurpose pants for every women\\'s wardrobe.  i don\\'t want to take them off once i put them on.  you can wear them dressed up or down, they are just great pants. i love these. very cool look.<br />i\\'m about a size 4 and they fit great, however i could see someone in a larger size not liking the waistband. this bundle included a lot of cute basics and a dress! they\\'s comfy.<br />-da gf<br /><br />that\\'s all i was able to get out if her for the review got dang it i love these tights! still waiting for a chance to wear them..<br /><br />i\\'m no dancer, but my little cousins are. i saw my little cousin wearing these tights with a skirt one day, and i loved how it looked.<br /><br />i\\'m sure you don\\'t need to be a dancer to buy these, i just bought them for the fashion aspect of having perfectly smooth legs with a floral skirt or something. they\\'re smooth...and they fit....and they\\'re exactly what i wanted. i really needed petite, but wanted the color, so settled for short since it wasn\\'t available in petite 8.  they are a little long but doable. i love it! i got so many compliments when i wore them! i would recommend. super comfy and very light weight. love these pants! they are flowy and very comfortable! i wish they had an option to just go slightly smaller is all! i continue to wear them anyway with no compalint and just take care of the slipping prob in my own ways :) i would buy again. may be a little small but overall ok. these fit well. they\\'re very thin tho and suuuuuuper long. i\\'ll only be able to wear these in the house for that reason. but they\\'re very comfy. i looove these !!so comfy and just what i expected  i love the colour and need more .<br />just hope the colour won\\'t fade after washing the girl i bought them for, said they were comfortable and she liked them. super comfy and nice medium thickness. colors are true to the screen and aren\\'t too hot to sleep in. i would buy these again. plus you can\\'t beat the price! i love the soft material and the way it stretches. the color of the blue is gorgeous. i\\'m glad i bought these skinny leg pants, very comfortable. nice and warm for cold days. great fit, great value for your dollar.  the material is very soft and fits comfortable, better than expected. highly recommend good and the best ever i have been seen so i will order some thing from them soon i love it very thin material. great pants, really comfortable, not too long, good price. i just got them today so i can\\'t speak to durability but they seem to be good quality. these are high quality slacks and fit very well. definitley will buy them again. love the color and fit is as expected nice i had been looking for some white linen pants and after several orders of disappointing linen pants from different companies i finally ordered these and i\\'m so happy i did! they feel great and fit great! can\\'t wait to buy another color!!! highly recommended and fast shipping!!! love em\\'! if you\\'re thinking about ordering them, go ahead it\\'ll be the best $34 you ever spent!! i am a male so i had to measure my hips to get the right women\\'s size and they fit great. bought these to put in my survival pack, turn them inside out and they retain body heat. wear them normal and you can be spotted by a rescue plane from miles away. they roll up small. these are really long pants and they are a-lot more thin than i thought. i was thinking they were going to be the material of like yoga pants but they are still great summer pants. perfect pants for the summer and for lounging around.  the style is really nice though i wish there was another pocket on the other leg as well.  the material is really good and found no problems with the seams.  the price is really good but expect to wait for your order.  i plan on ordering more in the near future i love it!  it was great for my costume and made my butt look amazing.  the spandex material was great for dancing, which is probably why they are called rave pants.<br />totally worth the purchase. great buy! i love wearing these opposed to regular jeans! love the design, colors and material. perfect length. jazz it up a little. i received my pants today. the white printing on the pants are a bit different than what is seen.  i mean, the print figures on the pants seem smaller.  on the back part, some of the white has come off and smeared off, just on the back part of one leg.<br />but, overall, it\\'s not bad at all.... comfy! fits great and i love the color.  i always buy this style of pant. pants fit as i expected.. i love them but the only thing is they are a bit too long. im 5\\'1 and i\\'m going to need to have them hemmed up about 2-3 in. very nice this is best pair of skinny pants - i am a curvy size 6 and 5\\'2&#34; and medium fits me perfect...like glove. wow i really look  pretty on this one great fabric.cut  and style very flowing ,easy and stylish.love the oroduct. i love casual pants.  i like to be comfortable, and ordered these to try something new, and if i could buy a pair for every day of the year, i totally would!!!  and even a few extra pairs to sleep in!! these are the most comfortable lightweight pants i have worn!!  one thing that bugs me (only when i\\'m barefoot) is the elastic band on one ankle does not stay tight for some reason.  could even be operator error somehow, but that is the only thing that could be considered a minor flaw. these pants are unique and such eye-catching designs. they are very comfortable and relaxing the wide legs help you keep cool on hot days, not hot sweaty legs with fabric sticking to you. i haven’t had any issues with static either. i wash them on the cool water setting and hang them up to dry. they are great for lounging around in or wearing out an about good quality! the material these are made of feel great!  my order got lost in the shuffle of all of my christmas deliveries from amazon (totally my fault) so i did contact the sellers customer service department.  they emailed me back right away and my confusion was resolved. the pants feel and fit better than expected, very soft feel to them.  i ordered an extra large and usually i do not buy leggings, i never think they look right but we are going on a cruise and thought what the heck.  this pattern and the feel of them make me want to wear them. i would buy from them again for sure. i wish i had a pair in every color. my boyfriend keeps trying to steal them from me. they\\'re lightweight, stretchy, and so super comfy. my only complaint is that they shrunk a bit in the wash, and they\\'re now flood pants on my long legs. not too unusual for pajama pants, but i was excited when i first tried them on and they were actually long enough for me. these warmers are great--super comfortable and they stay where you put them without being too tight.  i\\'m going back for more colors. my daughter needed these for a dance class she is taking in advanced hip hop.  she loved them, stated how very comfortable they were she could wear them anywhere. they are soft knit almost like a yoga pant comfort.  she loves them! love this yoga pant. just an all round comfy hang out attaire. i keep at least 5 on hand a must these are thick enough to wear as pants, and the styling is super cute and original.  i\\'m 5\\'7&#34;, 140 lbs, and i usually wear a size 8-10 pants, and they fit me fine...without any sheerness.  it\\'s clear that they are leggings posing as jeans, but that\\'s part of their unique charm. great fit and great quality to my surprise... will be ordering more in the future:) recibido if you are tall these pants won\\'t stretch to your ankle.  for what i\\'m using them for it\\'s perfect.  nice, breathable and comfy. very comfortable. love the flare leg.<br />they ate long. im five feet tall and have to roll them up or i step on thfm these are exactly what i wanted, they are a little snug coming up over my hips, but it works.  i wanted something lightweight for swimming, it covers my thighs and it is very comfortable.  they wear like a second skin. colorful comfortable pant. fits good and looks good. i like these pants. so comfy these yoga pants and so soft! like your ugly sweat pants comfy but the look of yoga pants. they aren\\'t super tight  like the spandex type yoga pants. the material breaths more. love the color, the comfy fit, and the ease of removing wrinkles (i just spritz with water or hang near the shower rather than iron).  easy to wear professionally with a fitted jacket or casually with... whatever!<br /><br />took longer than most amazon purchases to arrive, but i expected this because it was shipped from the uk.  have received many compliments about these pants. sexy and flattering, super comfortable.  i love them.  they\\'re stretchy so they fit just fine.  they\\'re just as pictures great price i chose these because this is my daughters favorite character.  the material was excellent and they felt good on her body.<br />i would recommend this to all my family members. it may be overly dramatic to say these pants are the best thing to ever happen to me, but maybe just short of that.  i\\'m wearing them while pregnant but i anticipate loving them just as much after baby.  super comfy and not unflattering.  i did not anticipate the fabric being so thin but that hasn\\'t been bothersome. these are great.  i am 5\\'6&#34; and they are long on me.  i don\\'t wear heels so i may need to get some platform-type shoes but otherwise they are great. i ordered a medium because though im very tiny, my butt is on ther bigger side. these shorts were a bit big but theyre super cute just fits ... good fit. they are long and fit the different size people i purchased them for all i have to do is cut leg length to the length needed! 5\\'9 145 lbs. ordered the medium. need a 1 inch heel or so they don\\'t drag. not hemmed but cannot tell. love love love. super cute i\\'m 5\\'4&#34; 125lbs.  the leggings stop at the ankle bone on me.  look well well made and comfortable.  think enough that they are not see-thru these came way sooner than the expected delivery date and are super silky. they fit easily and you can actually read what\\'s on the leggings. overall, i\\'m very happy with this purchase! great work pants,  light weight. . fit well but now i am completely satisfied!! if you have seen blackmilk leggings, you know they are pretty but expensive!! these are cheap and the perfect dupe for blackmilk leggings. i am 5\\'4 and 120 lbs and these leggings fit perfect. they are opaque so you can wear them as pants too!! everyone loves them :) i love the smitten scrubs and own 7 pairs. the coral is beautiful but more revealing than the other colors. the amp pants fit more snug then the hottie slim pants.<br />undergarments will definitely show. it you are toned and choose  no show garments underneath they will look great. the fabric feels awesome. i will be wearing after tonining up a bit :-) i bought these for my daughter in a wheelchair. she is very small and about 4\\'6&#34;. they fit to her ankles almost, yet perfectly when she sits in her chair. the quality it awesome and the blue is the color you see on the screen (if you have hd computer:-). highly recommend. these are really great black capri pants...nice construction, easy to wash & wear and looks good with a  lot of different tops i love these jeans: the fit, the look, etc - but the fabric gets nicked and frayed very easily, especially if you have pets. they also run very long: i\\'m 5\\'7&#34;, but have to have several inches removed when hemmed, which changes the shape at lower leg/ankle this romper definitely has a weird fit. i am 5\\'7, size 8-10 in pants (pear shaped). i have a long torso and shorter legs as well.<br />i got size xxl because everyone said it was too small. it fit me, but it was a close call getting it past my thighs/butt. the top half of the garment fit excellent (i don\\'t have large breasts, but i think it would fit fine on someone with a larger chest too.) and the arms fit fine as well. but the area around the crotch was small, i have to be careful when crouching down or bending over, for fear of it ripping.<br />the material is good quality, and i think it looks really nice.<br /> the length of the shorts was actually great as well. i was worried they were going to be too short and my butt would peek out, but i actually rolled them up higher because they were longer than i wanted. so that\\'s a plus.<br />overall i think this is a good purchase, but probably better for people who have a shorter torso and longer legs (because of the short crotch length) and the xxl fits how a standard large would fit, so keep that in mind! just absolutely perfect--not high quality material by any chance, but it is cheap and exactly what i was looking for--great for yoga, mediation, and the like. i read in the reviews that they run a bit large. i ordered a size smaller and they fit perfectly. i\\'ve never worn pants so comfortable! i feel like i\\'m wearing pajamas. i\\'m a size 6 and i ordered the medium, it fits perfectly. so pretty. i love that i can wear them high waisted so they can smooth me out. i love that it\\'s not hemmed, i\\'m pretty short so i trimmed the bottom to fit me. they are so awesome that i bought them in other styles too. i got it a bit larger than normal. it washes perfectly-- no fuzzballs!!!  i\\'m looking for this in a large. i have 2 pairs of black and lost one in the move across country. please bring this back!!!! great for lounging, hiking, traveling, and you can dress it up to go out... no lines! the linen quality is great (not too thin).  the color is good. super comfy, and fits just as expected. they hug the hips and butt, as they\\'re supposed to, but the waist fits lovely! these are great for many occasions or just lounging! i highly recommend for anyone trying to achieve a relaxed style. i love these jeans. i wear them on my motorcycle. the are sharp looking and well made. there is a lot of detail, in the stitched folds as well as the gradation in fading and the ankle zippers. they fit great, its just i have calves so it bunches a bit at the knee. but very nice pants. perfect! sia changed the material - looks like they did a good job. i have no problems with see through. i am not crazy about the zipper, but it is okay.  i really like these pants and getting another pair! very comfy and fit nice i ordered the &#34;muscle pattern&#34;. rich, saturated colors and vivid graphics. i\\'m size 8, 32 inch inseam; they fit very tightly and are about 3-4 inches above my ankle bone. i have an extra-long torso but they come even a bit above my navel - i\\'ve never had that before! wearing them as comfortable pajamas the first night loosened them up a bit. no panty lines and undies not visible. even black undies are only a shadow through the white base fabric. thoughtful seaming in the crotch avoids the tender parts. the only seams are at the inside leg: the wide waist elastic is knitted-in, not sewn on, and there are no side seams and no front or back seams, so they make my profile smooth and slim. i\\'m 59 years old and bought them on a whim, but i love them and may even wear them in public!<br /><br />they were mailed from china and took 13 days to get to texas, usa.<br /><br />i also ordered the &#34;tribal floral tattoo&#34; print and the fit is the same. they took 9 days to arrive and came in the same package as the above.<br /><br />we big people know that many asian clothing companies state their fit in regards to asian people. pink queen is one asian company that seems to be realistic about one-size fit for people who are much bigger and taller than most asians. very nice and fit just right they are very, very stylist, i love them. comfortable too. i bought these for myself for christmas, most pj bottoms are so wide in the bottom that they ride up when getting into bed. these worked out just great for that purpose. they fit, are attractive, warm and i love \\'em!  oh, and they wash up nicely too! love these pants, but they do run somewhat small. i already knew this so i went up a size on these. i love these, classy enough for wedding attire. light and cool enough for a california summer heat-wave wedding. i actually bought the pants for someone else and they fit great. i am a professional dancer and am always looking for costume pieces. these leggings are made very well, especially for the price. they are a thicker spandex material so they retain their shape and don\\'t look like they will fall apart anytime soon, and the stitching is very good. i am so pleased that i just ordered 2 more pairs!! purchased for summer camp, and she can\\'t wait to wear them.  i haven\\'t washed them yet so i don\\'t know how they will hold up.  but the daughter was happy with them! amazon, you have truly out-done yourself with this little gem. what\\'s more comfortable than wearing jeans without underwear? why wearing jeans as underwear, of course. bravo, amazon. bravo. i was given this product in exchange for a review. i liked these alot they were very soft perfect except it was grey and i ordered black but i still love it i want more colors! color is great, fits very comfortable, very soft fabric, it\\'s a little long (i\\'m about 5\\'7\\'\\') but ok if worn with heels or cropped to height, personally i like the length. i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; so they\\'re alittle short but overall really nice. thin material so don\\'t wear crazy underwear. delivery was really fast. overall i really enjoy them. these fit great , love wearing them, i wear them to work, very comfortable. would love to get more pairs. these are a &#34;wee&#34; bit smaller than i\\'m used to, but i don\\'t mind b/c i wear them with over-sized tops or vests anyway.  they are so cute and comfortable!  i wear them all the time! after reading the reviews, i just knew that the pants would be too small but to my surprise they were a perfect fit. i am 5\\' 5&#34; and normally wear a large and i purchased a large and the fit, length and feel are all perfect. i purchased the linen pants with the elastic waist band and once again im very pleased. these are great jeans... they\\'re unusual, go with a lot of different tops, and look very fitted and sleek. these are clearly arkham asylum purple and not black. they appeared black in the photo, but after receiving them and reviewing the picture again, i can tell they are purple. super comfy pants, i love lounging in them! they are super stretchy so you may be able to go down a size love these pants.  very comfortable and stylish. makes me look thinner. most comfortable pants i own love them really love hatley lounge pants.  comfortable.  typically, a little long for me at 5\\'3&#34; (although legs are fairly long for my height.). tend to loose some length in the washing/drying process when they become perfect. beautiful and dressy. soft and comfortable. super happy! will probably buy a couple more pair in different colors! very good quality and excellent fit. well made but a tad small..too bad you can\\'t exchange for the next size up...well made but a tad small..too bad you can\\'t exchange for the next size up... my butt looks awesome in these pants. i am 5\\'9 140 lbs and muscular. i like my stuff tight and i think these look better tight than loose. they are tight on the butt and upper thigh and loose and they go down. they are almost too small but i like them. the material is a bit cheap though. i got a size small. i rated these a five because they are so cute and comfortable. i was worried about the one size fits all but they are perfect. i am a size 6-8 depending on the brand. they are as soft as pajamas but could certainly be dressed up or down. i am not sure how long they will last but at this price i will buy some more!!!! great fit and a perfect flow to the material. i should of got a smaller size they fall off but other than that i will be buying another pair great pants.  they do run small though. wonderful material. very comfortable. it is great gift ,i like it. it just as what i expected. i recommond it to you  :  ) perfect fit, color and style. based on the reviews of this product i ordered larger than i would normally. my pre-pregnancy size was a size 8 or medium. during my pregnancy i wear anywhere from a size 12-14 or large. i ordered a 1x and couldn\\'t be happier with the fit. some reviews say the material is too sheer. i didn\\'t have that problem with the yellow color. some reviews say these come way too long (6 or more inches) i didn\\'t experience that problem either i\\'m 5\\'9&#34; and they are perhaps 2&#34; too long and i wear them at my hips. i love the fold over feature and the material is soft and stretchy perfect for my pregnancy. i would absoulutely order another pair. when i ordered i was very worry about materiel most at the bottom of the jumpsuit, the size,but it was pretty in the picture so i like it no matter how i can fit by my self. but when i got my order i can believe it out of my thought , size was perfect fit, material was pretty, the price was cheap. i very satisfied with my order. they were a gift for a neighbor and she said they were just right.  i usually hesitate to buy clothing online but this was a very pleasant surprise--great fit. just great pants all around. thank you awesome pants......... the only reason that i sent them back, is they did not have pockets to put my cell phone or keys in them.. this sounds silly to say. however if i change my mind on that............ i would order them again!! i love elan! they fit and feel great keeping everything nice and tight. great for exercise, errands, or as casual with a nice top and sandals. will buy again. wear anywhere, easy maternity pants.  great for our babymoon, and out and about around town. highly recommended for all stages of pregnancy. i just love these! the fabric is not see-through at all and not too thin either. i can wear it with high wedges without worrying about shortening the length. fyi, i am 5\\\\\\\\\" and i got the medium size because i did not want them to be very skimpy around the hips. fit to a tee. fit perfectly. nice looking as well. highly recommend for a comfort fit. will have to order more. these are great pants and worth the price! they have the perfect rise in the waistline and are extremely well constructed. unfortunately, they run a size small and don\\'t make the next size up. too bad. i am 5.4, 110, size 0, ordered large and it fits perfectly. i really like this tracksuit fit. dee o\\'donoghue@ribuddyboy1500@gmail.com ;-) i love these pants. nice weight and heft to the fabric. they hang well. i\\'m 160 and 5\\'6, size 14. while i wouldn\\'t ask for them to be tighter, they are quite comfortable even at my size. i would order these again for sure. nice fit feels sexy but is not real leather but close. i love these! i ordered the green-a5 printed pants and it looks exactly like the picture! im 5\\'6 115 pounds and i ordered a size small and they fit perfect. they are longer you can wear them high waisted or fold the top which i think looks great.the material feels silky in this color and nice quality i\\'m very pleased with this orderer. since these are long i will be wearing these with a wedge if your taller than you could probably do a flat sandal. the shorts are very cute! they arrived weeks earlier than expected, and they fit. i am very thin and 5ft3in. the shorts have elastic waste that helps the fit. the shorts material is fine. i can wear these in public because they are pretty and do not look cheap. i get compliments about these shorts. i want a pair in every color! just as described. they fit as i expected.  really liked them. they were very comfortable to walk around in and not feel exposed.. these pants are flattering for plus size ladies. they wash well & are very comfortable! fabric doesn\\'t bag & looks neat. amazing! i just got them in the mail and i love them! they got here a lot quicker than i expected which was great. i couldn\\'t be happier! these are so warm, i even started to sweat in the middle of winter at a ski lodge in colorado. they were actually too hot! i wear these on the coldest nights, but most of the time they have to sit in my drawer or i only wear them for about an hour before they\\'re too hot. love them, so comfortable, i order another color. love the fabric, very light weight fits great. lots of compliments on it. shipped fast. love them, very comfortable but neat! great set to throw on and go :) i ordeted size up, these are.very cutw comfortable and surprisingly flattering! i love these pants! i got them for an outdoor zip line tour up north. they fit me perfectly after reading the reviews i got a md. i am usually a size 3, pants 5\\'1&#34;, 130lbs. very warm with the fleece lining but also flexible for movement. i wore thermal leggings underneath and i was cozy all day long comfortable and well made. im really satisfied with this moleton pants,i bought 2 pers and im wearing them almost everyday, they are super comfortable , highly recommended. they are worm and since they are too large i only wear them around the house - which is exactly what i bought them for. love them, at first i was a little concerned of them fitting me since they look like a large and am very petite ! but i was so wrong !! fits perfectly :) great fit. super soft. not too thin. long. i\\'m 5\\'9 and they are just right. the belly will fold over and fit postpartum. wish they had more colors!!! these are really nice especially for the price! i would say they run a bit small as i wear a small and ordered a med and they fit perfect. they r perfect!!! these pants are great for casual wear except that they\\'re on the long side so if you\\'re short-legged, don\\'t get them!  i\\'m 5\\'7 and they\\'re even a tad long on me.  i like that they\\'re so light-weight, you can even wear them in warm weather.  also, they feel more cotton than jersey which is fine with me. bought these for our daughter in law, for now they\\'re perfect. she\\'s expecting twins so not sure they\\'ll fit all the way through, but she loves them. just got my tracksuit yesterday, can\\'t complain. somewhat short. i wish they came about 2 inches longer so i could wear them with a nice pair of black heels. cute! cute! cute! hello, i really love this, and therefore i would like to know if size 6 is the only size you have available. i would like to know if you have a us size 3? love these pants!!! so comfortable! this is how pants for women should be. stretchy, sleek, sexy, and cheap! they are pretty thin but very strong. so much better than stiff, unflattering jeans. i would definitely buy again! great pants but they fit very small i am 5\\'2 and about 100 pounds and had to send back and order a medium. but the pants are amazing love them! these are really soft and comfy with pockets too. the color and fit is true to pictures. they are baggy and not form-fitting, but super comfy hang-out pants. i ordered lg, but could have gone with m, as they would have fit. i just washed mine in hot water and high heat dry & they shrunk down to fit. my daughter loves them! material is cheap. this company ships from china and i live in texas, so the expected time period of arrival was about a month and a half after they shipped... however, i received them only 3 weeks after they shipped! (yay!) these leggings look exactly like the picture shores. the colors are vibrant and do not get (significantly) lighter at stretched areas. i am 5\\'3\\\\\\\\\" and 96 lbs ;they are quite high-waisted and a bit of fabric gathers around my ankles, like how the picture shows.<br /><br />these leggings are wonderful and i will be wearing them quite frequently. great quality for a great price! absolutely love these pants. exactly what i wanted! very comfortable,  i can wear them to work or just hanging around the house,  or while working out.  love them! didn\\'t fit well tall and tight, but a good pant for the price. they fit great!! very comfortable i wear them all the time!! the yoga pants are very good quality. i am very pleased i got them. absolutely love them soft and warm perfect size and length shipped fast from china all around good product and good price the bottoms were a lil big...but the quality of the scubs exceeded my expectations it is so hot this summer, jeans are just sweltering when you are in the hot sun.  i needed a nice light piece of clothing that didn\\'t make me burn up. these wide leg yoga pants are my favorite new article of clothing. they have that new style no-elastic waistband that you can just fold down instead of having a horrible elastic line. i wear them everywhere!<br /><br />the fabric is super soft and very stretchy. it is comfortable and forgiving of my post-partum body (especially since it is black). they would actually be quite comfy when you are pregnant too. it is quite lightweight, which is perfect for being in the hot sun for many hours.<br /><br />i like that they are wide leg so they don\\'t look like the typical legging style yoga pants or tight leg with a slight flare yoga pants. these actually look more like real pants, but have the comfort of yoga pants.<br /><br />all in all i am very happy with my super comfy new pants. i\\'m so glad i received this item for free or at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. i couldn\\'t be happier with this product. this is my 4th pair of palazzo pants i have bought this year from different vendors.  i am 5ft 8in 150lbs.  i bought a large and they are snug in the hips and top of thighs but they are suppose to be.  they are made out of polyester so they do stretch.  i really like them.  yes, these are more see through than previous ones bought, but because of the pattern i don\\'t think it will be a problem. little long but love it. thank you. pink is the new black for winter 2013 fashion, and i was having trouble finding this bright of a shade of pink in stores. i ordered a 7/8 after reading reviews. i normally wear a 7 in juniors, so that is what i was leaning towards on the sizing chart. my hips measure at 37 inches and my waist is 29 inches, and these jeans fit perfectly. they are not too tight that my little bit of stomach fat pushes over the sides. the material is a jean material with a slight stretch to it and not a soft fabric feel. i would consider them a medium weight, which for me feels like pretty good quality. these jeans are much better than i expected. i am planning to buy more, because this is a great price to get exactly what you want versus having to settle for something that doesn\\'t quite fit what you are looking for in a store. i like them and the material feels wonderfull i wear an xl, but i bought these in xxl. i love love love them, comfy fit (could still be comfy in an xl..i\\'m size 18 with 33-36&#34; inseam), awesome long, unhemmed length, super duper soft rayon/spandex blend, nice high waist helps keep everything smooth and under control. i only wish they came in print patterns too for this size. i\\'ve tried other wide leg palazzo\\'s and they are all too short or too tight or both. if you are looking for a solid color, don\\'t waist your time looking further buy these! my favorite brand leggings! great fit. great with tunic tops. these are not the poly/nylon leggings for workouts,but a much nicer cotton for daily wear. great fit. fit great and very soft material. beautiful material. drapes nicely. i\\'m barely 5\\' tall and a size 0 and like the fit. i love these but i didn\\'t read the reviews before my purchase. definitely order a size down maybe even 2 sizes down. they just get really loose throughout the day and start falling off. other than that i love the material and feel of them, i\\'m ordering other colors in probably a size 14 since the 18 fit like 22. great - just what i wanted! fit perfect.  love these pants they are the perfect substitution for pajamas. comfortable, gift great!!!!!! it fits bigger but the true is that i\\'m not a complaining person with something that looks nice and you always can fix to put it on; in my opinion, its better if fits bigger \\'cause you can wear it anyways... if its smaller than the size that you choose, i\\'m going to tell you, forget it... you never gonna get it on...hahahaha, is nice to find things like that with this great price!! this product rocks.  i put my shorts over them.  when i ride down to the jettys (16 miles)  on the beach and sit on the rocks to enjoy my coffee, i have a built in padded seat.  funny looking but no one sees them but you. they have pockets which are a huge plus. they are a little long in the length of the pants but i am also kind of short so keep that in mind they are super comfortable and warm and i would wear these all day if i could these shorts fit well and i like the shorter length, better to get some sun on the nice days! the only slight issue i have is that the padding is a little bulky and not as thin or well fitting as the more expensive brands. but that\\'s pretty hard to notice when they\\'re black and you\\'re riding! i liked the material and they are comfy, i usually never have to hem pants as i have long legs, and i had to cut off 2 inches and then hem them. they fit great everywhere else tho. love them! love, love, love these pants! nice these pants are quite flattering. the only drawback is that it has a line that goes down the front which caused discomfort in my knees. i love the themmmmm.. this is actually my second pair of these scrub pants.  my legs are long, so it is difficult to find scrubs that are long enough, even in talls.  these finally reach the floor, yet still do not drag, which means i am in love!<br />they are also soft and comfortable and wrinkle resistant.<br />the rise of the waist also fits me perfectly, since most scrubs have to be altered to keep the waist from being in my armpits.  these are the first scrubs i have ever had fit me perfectly without alterations.  that is saying something.<br />i do find them a bit pricey, but for me, they are worth every penny.  i will be buying more colors over time as i gradually eliminate the others that did not fit as well as these.<br />there is a little doohickey in the leg cuffs that i find a little awkward when i am seated on the floor...but i think it would be easy enough to snip it right out and no more lumps! can\\'t wait for spring/ summer it is very hard for me to find a plus size pant with good length.<br />it is even harder to find a good product at this price.<br />i highly recommend them.<br />iam very pleased. nicely i love these pants. get many compliments! my daughter loves them. she says they are very comfortable. we did have to fix a small hole were the thread came undone but no big deal for us. these pants are amazing.  i wish i could find them in more colors.  i am 5\\'9 and they are long enough, which is hard to find and they are thick not thin like some other riding pants/leggings.  they sell these at nordstrom for double the price.  save your money and order two pair on amazon. excellent! so soft and comfortable , fits perfectly, love these pj pants, will surely buy some more, especially in winter, warm flannel love them! the pants were too long for me great my grand daughter who lives in wyoming said it keeps her warm and she loves it. said the quality is great and i am thinking of getting one for my daughter and myself.<br />i would very much recommend it! love! kinda long (i\\'m 5\\'9&#34;, so thats saying something), but love. light and loose....makes me look taller and thinner more like tights, more see-through than opaque. granddaughter loves them! good quality, really like them. perfect love! i bought these for my home made halloween costume. these were exactly what i was looking for (couldn\\'t find any in a store). these look awesome! shiny material almost a metallic look. very nice.<br />these fit for the most part. only issue i had was they were really long on my legs (i have really short legs. i\\'m 5 ft). i have worn this style koi scrub pants for a few years and it is my favorite. i have 4 different colors now & i am so happy to be able to obtain them with my amazon prime subscription.<br />the right leg side pocket is one of my favorite features of this style. i love these pants. the material is thinner than i expected but that just makes it wonderfully lightweight and perfect for summer. it\\'s so cute and comfortable, i plan to wear it out even though i know they\\'re supposed to be pajama pants. perfect. i love them. i own two pairs and counting. don\\'t dry in dryer, air dry them because they shrink each time you dry it. perfect, and so comfortable, i ordered a second pair it\\'s a little smaller than i expected but it does fit. i\\'m just afraid to bend over to pick up anything i drop. hello booty! i didn\\'t read the material description before ordering so i didn\\'t realize it was full on spandex. looks hot, not gonna lie, but the material looks cheap so this will only work in a club where it\\'s really dark. although, that\\'s exactly where i planned on wearing this anyway! i purchased this pant set to wear for casual events in semi-warm weather.  the material lays nicely from the neck and shoulders down to the waist and legs.  this set is very comfortable and flows with your movement.  the only negative thing i have found is that the pant material has a tendency to cling to my legs (if i wear panty hose).  i use skin lotion and i also use anti-static spray that works every time no matter the material. for any woman that has nice legs and does not need panty hose, i am sure you will not encounter any static problems.  i am very pleased. amazed nice fit, though a bit large at the waist and long too.  i guess i am just too short for when i wear with heals and an un-tucked, shirt to hide the belt, i\\'m okay. great comfortable pants-i bought every color available.  very soft material. they do run a bit large in size though. i read the reviews and i was worried about the pants fitting too small. i am currently a 6 (29) but i ordered a 8 because i read that a 6 was a 0 0-4 (???). well, they are enormous. i am going to order a 4.  i am 5&#34;7\\' (cm 170) and weigh about 118 lb. my hips are very large.<br />the fabric seems interesting, not the usual jeans like material but something lighter. the leg is not skinny but pretty straight. i like skinny fit, i\\'ll see what happens when the pants are smaller overall. a+ buy these over and over.  perfect fit and good quality. these booty shorts look exactly like the photo (gold). i\\'m a size 4-6, so since i heard that they can run on the small side, i ordered a size medium. the elastic fits a bit tight at the hip (as they do on the model in the photo), but it\\'ll be fine. a large would have been too big, so i ordered the right size. the shipping was fast and they packaged them nicely in pink tissue paper. i also appreciated the free gift: a hotfromhollywood nail filer...it\\'s one of those large sturdy ones, so i really appreciated that.  i would order from them again in the future. i love them! the length on the petite was perfect and comfort of the waist band was great. the pockets come in handy as well love it but i did have to get them hemmed and i am 5.5 and were heals.  so if you are really tall these are great. love them ! i love them anyway they are a little big but they are very comfortable. lightweight garment very nice for the summer.  fit is a bit on the small side. these are the best pants in this style i\\'ve ever tried on. they flatter and don\\'t cling to every flaw like some thinner and cheaper versions do. and they\\'re long enough for my tall self to wear heels with! i\\'m definitely buying another pair. worth every penny. i love these pants and i have previously order to other pair, i took them out of the packaged and washed them and went to put them on and got disappointed because the pattern in the front was sewed into the seam of the leg and looked all twisted, really showed up with the pants being white.  i had already threw the package away. i haven\\'t had time yet but i am going call amonzon to see if they will replace them. otherwise really cute and comfortable. i have a slim build so its hard finding clothes that hug me in the right places, but these do and they are so comfy, i will be back for more! i have 3 pairs, favorite pants ever.<br /><br />they stretch as you wear them (linen!) so 3rd pair i bought a smaller size and after 15 minutes they fit perfect! in addition to coming super fast, these are exactly as pictured! super comfortable, flattering and sturdy. i\\'d recommend to anyone and will be shopping for more! great look, thick so for warmer weather tolerable only. kinda long for us shorties but i\\'m used to that. these scrubs fit perfectly and are super comfortable. love the material and the color. i\\'d highly recommend it. i ordered the medium because the small was out of stock in this colour. they\\'re a little baggier than i\\'d like. i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; and 120 pounds, usually take a size 6 in pants. bought in 3 colors! love! even though mine were too small for me i contacted them and they immediately respond to my request. i absolutely love these pants. they fit me perfectly. i\\'m 5\\' 7&#34; 128 lbs i\\'m on the slim side but i have a big booty. i have a hard time finding pants that fit at the waist and butt at the same time. i got these in a large and i love them. they fit like a expect love them, my first-ever, fit very well. love them good fit! i will most likely order more of these pants excellent quality<br />runs small  ( 5\\'6&#34;  - 128 lbs )<br />medium felt too small - returned them<br />have not decided if i will reorder very comfortable and cool. the shorter you are, the more billowy the legs, of course. can also push them up to the knees, as cuffs are elasticized. this gives more of a skirt effect. contrary to what one might think, these pants do not make you look fatter than you are, as they drape nicely and do not puff out in the hips and legs. the reason i buy this style, is that they fit such a wide range of sizes and body types. my weight tends to yo-yo with the seasons, and i can add as much as 15 lbs. to my small frame in nothing flat, before i panic and lose it all again. in the meantime, i go from pants that practically hang off me, to pants that i can barely squeeze into, and feel confined when i do. this style solves the problem. they are comfy no matter what size i am. i recommend them, though be prepared for some second looks. i\\'m old, so i don\\'t care. you won\\'t look like everyone else, but i\\'ve only been complimented on them. a note of caution: washing instructions say to wash separately, and believe them. i got lazy and washed them with some white tee shirts which came out of the wash pink. runs very large - otherwise a nice product (has pockets) what a marvelous pair of pjs!!  i don\\'t wanna take them off- so comfortable.  they shame all  my other poor attempts at pjs.  but i got one size larger than i usually do.  because it\\'s important to me pjs touch the floor for complete coverage.  :)  and they do.  so they are also very baggy.  everywhere.  which is just fine.  still i don\\'t know if my original size would pass.  i\\'ve had trouble w/ other pjs that just don\\'t cut it.  and none of them were this soft!!<br /><br />anyway- i\\'m 5\\'4&#34;, 130 lbs and i\\'m medium.  but i ordered a large and they are baggy.  but for me, that\\'s ok.  i like room to be comfortable.  i\\'m sure totally pink will be hearing from me again!! i love my swimwear pants! i got a large size (i\\'m usually small size) because at the time was the only one available and it fits perfectly. these are well made, not too heavy. wear with a long top and boots. fit was excellent and as indicated on sizing. i do recommend them. i  will buy them again. thanks amazon. great in every way! love them! they were a gift, and while the person liked them, the pants were not what she was looking for. i liked this. it was entertaining. overall i\\'d say it was well worth the price. yup, worth the price... uh huh. fit great!  will be back to purchase some more they fit so well. i got the black one and the one with the coral fold. they fit way different! i love the black ones & hate the coral ones. so be aware of that. the reviews will not be accurate unless they say what color they got. the black ones are superrr comfy though and the pink ones are tight and unflattering on me. they both fit though. got them in small, i am 5\\'4 and 125 lbs. fit well, came quickly, geat color. ido love it. bought these for my daughter and she loves them yes!!! these are great!! get them. super flattering and really comfy. material is nice. can dress these up or down for sure. purchased because reviews was good. i will buy these again.<br />waist was very comfortable, they are a little too long, but if i order regular length on other jean they are to short<br />after i wash them. so cute and comfy. fit as expected. i\\'m 5\\'4\\'\\' and 115 pounds and i ordered a small. the legs were a bit too long and required hemming but besides that i love the jumpsuit. i get so many compliments on it i agree with other reviewers:these are warm and cozy to the skin, and lightweight. my only other comment also agrees with some of the others reviewers: very pricey for \\\\\\\\\"long johns\\\\\\\\\". soft, comfortable, length is ideal -- i\\'m 5\\'9.5&#34;, 195 lbs. and the xl fits me really well.  the price is a good deal and i\\'ll definitely be getting another pair.  black isn\\'t see-through at all, but i can see how lighter colors might be.  you won\\'t regret the purchase. i like it a lot. it looks as pictured but the waist is very large for me so i will be having it tailored. it also fits a little close around my thighs but i have more thighs than butt so that\\'s probably why wife loves them for bike riding loved it! fit exactly as expected, and i wear it all the time. i would recommend it to anyone else! i ordered these floral shorts cause they were cheap i didnt expect them to be such a good quality and fit well but they did they are great for spring and summer cant wait to wear them with my nice sheer top i\\'m very pleased with these pants. they fit well, and aren\\'t as tight as other linen pants i tried on. love these pants - pocket is big enough for a smartphone!  they fit and look great! love it but fragile material very nice fabric and movement.  attractive as to flatters figure. xl just a little tight on me in the waist,  (size 16-18).  still would have kept, except i am 5\\'10\\' and these barely brushed the top of my feet, so i did have to return, which did greatly disappoint me, they are exactly what i was looking for and at a great great price. i was skeptical about ordering these pants initially.  however, i am so glad that i did.  they are very comfortable and they look great on.  i will definitely shop again.  also they shipped very quickly. this is the second pembrook outfit i have purchased for my 84-year-old mother.  she loves them!  they fit well, the colors are bright and the embroidery adds that little something that makes the ensemble.  unfortunately you can\\'t find a lot of pembrook outfits, i think they mainly sell to retail establishments.  so if you happen to something you like, snap it up. love them. perfect fit, material weight and texture. would love in more colors. now i am interested in how they turn out after washing them. these are just the pants i wanted to wear when i work around the house. they are comfortable since they have an elastic waist and are loose fitting. pockets add to their convenience. i have washed them in cold water every week since i got them so i know they wash well if you follow washing directions. in absolute love with my skeleton leggings 😘😘😘 these are wonderful pants-medium-heavy fabric and a very soft cotton feel they get softer as you wash them... best pajama pants ever. my daughter was very surprised to receive these christmas morning.  the fit was perfect - she is 5 feet tall so they were a little long.  she is crazy for her new lounge wear. my daughter loved the shirt love the texture. it\\'s smooth and comfortable especially for those work days when u are up and running. juggling many things. great color and fit was a gift but the person  wears them . excellent i was looking for a pair of black leggings that i could wear in my third trimester of pregnancy as the weather got cooler. these pants definitely satisfied that need.  the material is soft and thick, making the pants extremely comfortable and versatile. i can wear them on the weekends, as well as to work with a nicer top. i purchased a large because it was the only option available, and it was on sale.  but i normally would have purchased a medium, and the pants are a little big -- especially after wearing them for a few hours. pre-pregnancy, my pant size could vary between a size 4 and size 8 depending on the brand, but i normally would wear a size 6.  i actually liked the length of them (i am 5\\'8&#34;) ; however, i wanted to shrink them a size, so i washed them on hot and then dried them (which i normally do not do).  washing and drying them was very effective on shortening the pant, but as i said above, after wearing the pants for a few hours they start to sag a little.  overall, i would recommend the pants. i love texture, feels good on skin. will order a size up soon. the only reason am not giving this a five star is because it wasn\\'t my perfect size and that\\'s why am ordering another soon. everyone loves them.  !!!! item is perfect, great fit, i wear an 6 & the medium fit very well, the item came on tie as we\\'ll they fit just as i expected, needing to be hemmed for someone short like myself. they fit well otherwise just wish they had been available in a petite size since it\\'s costing me more money to have them hemmed than it did to buy them. love them i got the pants in a timely fashion. they fit right. the color was just a little off but i\\'m content. too long for someone with very short legs. rest of size is fine. just as described beautiful the fit was fine love these pants. comfy and stylish.great fit / small (i\\'m 5\\'2 and size 3) these cotton/spandex lounge pants are wonderful. i broke my ankle and the pants are easy to get on and off over my cast. very comfortable for lounging and sleeping. great color. just received these and, though it says plus sized in the description, the tag on the inside says \\\\\\\\\"standard size\\\\\\\\\".  this will not fit any plus size individual, and the standard size seems to be a medium/large, but that\\'s pushing it.  this definitely won\\'t fit even a size 1x individual.  i\\'ll be giving these away as a gift to a family member.<br /><br />edit: i received an e-mail from candystore and they very kindly offered to send out something that was plus-sized, so i\\'m satisfied with that.  fyi, the family member is into dancing and will really love the pants, so they\\'re worthwhile for the ease of movement.  thanks to the store owner for being so kind as to contact me and to fix the complaint. i absolutely love these pants! i was nervous when i received them but they have just enough stretch so that i can move around and feel comfortable. i normally wear a size 5/6 pants/jeans so i ordered a medium. they\\'re neither jeans nor leggings but they are very comfortable and look like denim skinny jeans. i just ordered 3 more pair in different colors because i loved them so much. made out of good materials. they\\'re a little stretchy and the colors are expected. i wear these to the gym and i haven\\'t had a problem with flexibility or falling apart. not sure why other people had an issue with the sizing on this set--it fit perfectly/true to size/fit for me even based on other brands including med couture, wonderwink, and cherokee. for reference, i ordered size small and i\\'m 5\\'7&#34;, 132 lbs carried more in my hips than in my chest. great style & i love the contrast ribbing. love these pants.  they are full and flattering, but not overly wide to the point of being clumsy.  i was able to wear them on a pretty warm day, even though they are substantial, probably good for the fall. and they are great for lounging around in.  i will be buying another pair. this was a good product it fits right on no problems. so if you are a big girl don\\'t worry this will fit . they came extremely quick- i love that. they are for short people. they fit true to size. i am 5\\'3 135lbs, not very tiny. they look really great on, get lots of compliments. great quality. would buy from this seller again. great fit & very confortable just perfect for your work out i\\'m really shocked at how great these pants are for the price. they are comfortable,  and the fold -over waist band is very flattering as well. i bought the taupe, and after receiving them purchased the black. i\\'m 5 ft tall,  slender but with wider hips and thighs than waist, but the small fit great, except for the length of course, but i\\'m used to having th hem my pants. i am 5\\'8&#34; and usually wear a 14/16, body shape is a curvy hour glass. these fit me perfectly and what a perfect pant for travel... no wrinkling. easy wash and dry. dress it up or casual/playful.  these are are my go to\\'s for just about everywhere.  in fact, i bought 2 pairs in plain black to go with the many others i have in various prints.  the are true wide leg palazzo style. no pockets for those who care.  if you haven\\'t tried a pair, you should!  be mindful of their sizing chart, it will help you chose just the right size.  happy fancy pants! i will be getting more of these pants love these! i ordered a large because i read they run tight (and they do) but i\\'m happy with the size i went with. long, but very comfy! good fit, true to color. seem durable i love it!! great for a 70\\'s look for halloween, but also good for every day look. i am 5\\'8 at 221 lbs it\\'s somewhat small only because i am tall and when i pull it up to a jumpsuite it comes to my knees but other than that it is nice! i love those pants. exactly as pictured the material is soft. neither very thick nor thin so it can be worn through the year may be except the very hot summer days. love it! i order a medium and i\\'m 5ft 9 and size 8-10 medium....must get it! love love love; so unexpected them to be so comfortable. these pants are great for  comfort and ease of movement.  they also matched my required uniform color exactly.  they fit me loosely in the legs, but i have that problem frequently.  they have a touch of stretch unlike most scrub pants which makes a world of difference.  love them! i love these pants!!  they are so comfortable!  and the fabric is so soft!  it just flows. i love this fabric!  i will buy these again and in other colors. these were somewhat big, but they are still nice pants. bought as a gift for someone who asked for pajama bottoms. she said they were soft and comfortable. great for lazy days. i will be purchasing more of these in different colors - snug, comfortable, cute, professional or casual stretch gauchos in every color one could want! (p.s. they make your hinder look fantastic!) they fit nice and the fabric is great and the breathe well i read he reviews and the size chart before purchasing. they fit well! they\\'re elastic waisted so they\\'re comfortable. the only negative is that there are only three belt loops for the white belt so it is kind of silly. i like the way it holds my curves rather than bow out around. i am 5\\'3 and have 36 inch hips. great gift for a loved one. my wife used to be a dancer and loves these i was surprised at how quickly the order arrived, about 10 days, as opposed to amazon\\'s estimate which was much longer.<br /><br />i ordered this and another pair of convertible zip off pants together since i like both styles.<br />this pant is thick like jeans, material and style is very high quality and comfortable! i like it!<br /><br />sizing chart was accurate, fits perfect.  i definitely recommend these pants! i am a average high woman and they come above my ankles but other than that great and very warm. stretchy and comfy. i am not preggers but have fybromyalgia and anything that fits around my waist is very painful.  after seeing some of my daughter\\'s maternity pants, i decided to give it a try.  they are so comfortable and cause no discomfort what-so-ever! i actually wear these as leggings underneath dresses and skirts. they\\'re awesome and keep everything sucked in and smooth looking without being uncomfortable. definitely worth the extra money. excelent great love them thank you love them great fit!! the pants are really nice. fabric is nice and they are nicely lined. i would purchase these again. you sure can\\'t beat the price. i ordered up one size and really shouldn\\'t have. i wore these short for a 30 mile bike race and they were fantastic. worth every penny. love love love them....absolutely a knockout!!!! the bottom of the pants are not hemmed. perfect fit, nice color and right length.  i am a size 6 to 8 and these jeggings is not too tight at all, i think they would stretch up to a size 11.  i bought 6 pair. very nice. a little transparent but they look very classy these are perfect, i\\'m 5ft and they were very long for me (but that was expected). fortunately they are being tucked into boots, so i wasn\\'t even remotely disappointed. i love these pants! comfortable and flattering. the fit was comparable to other brands. i highly recommend them. love the pants but don\\'t like the fact they have no hem. i am absolutely 100% in love with these pants. i loved them so much, i ordered 3 more pairs!! i paired it with a light flowy black boatneck dolman top (also found here on amazon) and i was a hit at the bbq. these are more comfortable than jammy pants and light enough to stand up to the summer heat. they comfortably hug your hips and mid section making you feel confident and softly held in, no need for spanx and you can\\'t see any cellulite!! amazing! i want to live in these pants. super long, so they\\'re great if you are tall and thin.  i\\'m not tall, so i had to have them hemmed.  i love how lightweight they are for hot summer days, and may get another pair before i travel to hot areas. came erlier than expected too ! they were just as advertised. light material, sizing was accurate. no complaints. this was a well crafted pants, my wife love it. only one thing...how about making different colors using the same material and craftsmanship. good fit well -- nice soft knit -- like them! they fit great. im a size small and have a very difficult time fitting into any pants which is why i never order them online. but thankfully i had no problem with these. this is a good jean and very comfortable with a good fit. looks like the pic i like it these are so awsome ! love them a lot!! very comfortable!!! i want more of these and recommend to everybody love these pants! they are a little bit large but with the belt work great. the length is just right. i am 5.4 and 118 pounds too bad there aren\\'t more colors available, because these pants fit very well and i like them.  one two three a perfect pair for upcoming spring. it is light and easy to wear. they also have a<br />range of very beautiful and eye-catching colors; simply stunning. for such a cheap price these pants are super cute! i\\'m 5\\'5 and weigh 152 lbs with a good bit of hips! i bought the white pair in medium and they\\'re perfecct! the black pair all they had was a double xl - but it\\'s nothing a little safety pin cant fix! i am super impressed with these jeans. i usually do not purchase my clothing online due to the factor that i am a plus size woman and have a problem finding clothes that actually fit -  especially jeans. however these jeans fit just right and curve to my hip and body to look stylish and pretty awesome! the embroidery on the back pockets are great and the color is dark and washes well. i usually lean away from dark colors in my jeans due to the factor that the ink leaks and am normally left with faded jeans after a few washes. these jeans do not do that, i must have worn it over a dozen times and after each wash it looks just as great as the first. i was super satisfied at the price and the selection of colors. not only is the jeans soft and curved my body it also was the right length and looked great. now that i know these pants fit i am excited to purchase other ones in different colors. compared to outlet prices this jeans are at a great price and very affordable. disclaimer: i received this product for free or at a discounted price for my honest review. they r worth buying !! i got a lot of compliment on them ... the only thing is if u r like me 5\\'2 u would need to cut them cuz they r to long but worth it cuz they r pretty in person !! i would recommend them ! my daughter loves these and has been wearing them for both casual around the house situations and even out to dinner. i do like them but, their to long in the legs . and i asked for a return lable and my computer wont work so how do i send them back? fits as expected. material a little more thin than i would have thought but make for a good spring early summer pj. just a tad long - that\\'s better than too short. very good yoga pants for the price. i am short (about 5\\'4) and i like a extra long yoga pant with a bit of a flare. the fit is just what i like. the fabric is soft but a little bit thin. overall a good pair of cheap yoga pants. awesome pants. exactly what was in the picture. i\\'m 5\\'8 and 140 lbs and a size 6 and they fit absolutely perfect love these scrubs and fit so comfortably. i wanted a pair of camouflage pants, but comfortable. i wear an 8/10.  i bought these in a medium.  i love, love, love these.  but, i believe these are too nice to wear watching birds and walking in the park.  they are a tad  dress-up. i\\'m not complaining.  i\\'m just surprised.  and i\\'m looking forward to trying to decide on another pair, in addition.  they are all an artist\\'s delight.  new ideas in clothing with just beautiful designs is exciting to me.  thank-you. such a great fit and are slimming as well.  they keep their fit all day long.  since i am only 5 feet they are long.  wishing they would offer them in petite sizing! i\\'m definitely going to buying more colors. i love the dark green ones! and they\\'re stinkin comfy good i\\'m 5\\'11 and these fit perfect, they fall over my shoe just how i wanted, very light can wear all day. i hand dry them just cause i am so tall and don\\'t want them to shrink at all. love them! love it.  seam work didn\\'t fall apart (thank goodness) and stayed bright and didn\\'t loosen up. this is a very good product love them!  got them today, tried them on, a little long but i\\'m only 5\\'2 and 117 pd.so i washed them and their perfect i ordered a medium. if you are taller order up because they will shrink. definitely worth it to me! very sexy leggings. i love them! perfection! ok better than i expected. fit great on me. if you are curvy like i am they will fit you nice. have a hard time finding pants because i have a big butt and thighs but little calves and ankles. so if you\\'re like me i highly recommend them. the material is soft and the product is well made. it fits a bit baggy around the knees, but it\\'s not very noticeable. i really like the pockets. i love all the clothing from here.  it does run big so i would suggest ordering a size smaller than you would normally purchase. i really love the way these pants fit.  i can actually keep them up while exercising and they don\\'t stretch out like some others do.  i like the way they hug my legs and they are really soft so they feel good while you are wearing them while exercising or just lounging around the house.  i highly recommend these. everything was great. there were things i would never order that looked great on! glad i ordered this.. :) very nice fit....comfy like pajamas....only 4 stars, because the material is not high quality....but other than that they\\'re nice! somewhat long in the legs but they are so comfy, the material is lovely and they were a bargain! i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; and the medium was long on me. i have been searching high and low for thermal pjs that were soft, comfortable and did not have seams in the crotch area, which are uncomfortable to me. these were perfect! the way they did the seaming allows you to wear these without underwear and without discomfort! the grey pants for some reason are softer that the pink heart ones, but the pink are cuter. the material is definitely very thin, so i am not sure how long these will hold up. to me, i don\\'t care! i\\'m ordering a ton because no company addresses the seams anymore! these wide leg pants absolutely fabulous, they are extremely soft, comfortable, and have excellent stretch. i am 5\\'3&#34; 106 pounds and i ordered black in size small and they fit perfectly. it\\'s a great pants to wear to work if you are in retail, if you are a businesswoman and a nice pair of pants, they\\'re also not a great pair pants to wear on a casual night out. i love how they fit and feel on my body. they are just flattering and fun, i love them. isn\\'t there a type of fabric i was very scared that they were going to cling to me, static cling, after washing and drying them but fortunately that is not the case they do not stick to my legs and they feel wonderful. they are a beautiful pair of pants that are sure to get you compliments. these are absolutely my very own honest opinions after having received and tried this product for free in exchange for an unbiased and honest review. love these jeans love these pants! i bought this as a gift and i am more then happy with them! they\\'re very stretchy and colorful! great! i love these!! im 5\\'4 and 210lbs (most of the weight in my lower body) i bought the 1x and it fits great....i can\\'t wait to wear them on my vacay to south beach love these pants, however, they fit smaller than i had hoped. light weight great for warmer weather i was looking for something to wear year round. fit a little snug around waist but not where i couldn\\'t wear it i am very happy with these wide leg knit pants so far.  don\\'t buy them if you aren\\'t expecting very wide legs, but that is exactly what i was looking for, so i was satisfied.  the black was a nice, true black (unlike to the wimpy, greyish color i sometimes see in inexpensive plus-sized clothing), and the slacks have side pockets, which put them above the similarly proportioned but much shoddier wide-legged knit pants which i have been in the habit of ordering from roamans (as opposed to woman within).  a note to anyone who hasn\\'t purchased similar pants before:  i happen to love these kinds of pants because i put a premium on comfort and have a medical condition which makes the wide legs work well for my needs, however, don\\'t labor under the delusion that the wide-legged look is particularly flattering if you are a short, large woman. very nice and warm. just received this item and it\\'s soooo cute and comfortable but i only wish it came a little long but i\\'ll make it work. reading the other reviews, prior to ordering, was helpful, as i was purchasing these pants as a christmas gift, and didn\\'t want to have to return them. the small size was a perfect fit, which is comparable to size &#34;00&#34; in juniors. the pants were exactly as described by the seller & arrived in time for christmas. i can\\'t believe how amazing these look and feel. i\\'m about to buy the rest of the styles :( must air dry! so cute but soooo long! i have to have them hemmed a lot! but so cute! super comfortable!  i read the reviews and i knew they would be shear. with that in mind i already expected this so i planned on wearing longer tops to cover my bum. they are thin, soft and comfy. i am 5\\' and was able to wear 3&#34; wedge sandals with these. the bottom of the pants skimmed the floor. i cannot wear flats with these. i own black and mint colors in size large. pants were of excellent quality and sold at a great price. shipping was a little high. overall i felt it was a very good<br />value. i would wear these pants during the hottest day in summer and i live in texas, they\\'re thin but no so thin that they\\'re see through, got here 2-3 weeks before expected, and they fit amazing, they look a little bit more baggy on me because i\\'m only 5 feet tall but even at that they still fit great! the material is fine. they seem like they would be decent pants for someone who\\'s looking for standard cargos, since the style seem to be a little difficult to find. there are drawstring straps on the inside of the waistband, to tighten slightly. description of item is accurate.<br /><br />sizing: i ordered the us size 4/large (29) in solid army green (the color i think is important to specify since there might be varying sizing for each). i am 5\\'0 ft, and 105 lbs. these are pretty huge on me. very baggy, barely hang on to my hips. unwearable. my jean size usually lands between 1 and 3 (at, say, hollister co.).<br /><br />the problem here is that the us sizing is posted, and if i use their size chart i am pretty much a us size 0, and it seems i should\\'ve ordered that based on what i received (for army green). however, then it tells you to order one or two sizes up, as do half of the reviews? maybe the information has been updated, or it differs, but i\\'m guessing the small/27 would have fit fine. not really anyone\\'s fault, just a lot of confusion about the sizing, which might not be consistent, anyways. i can only say how it fit for me, though. good luck! i bought these pants for my mom.  she is 5 foot 2 inches, 94 lbs and they fit her very well.  i tried them on.  i am 5\\'3&#34;, 125 lbs. and they fit me well also.  my mom was very happy with this pant.  they looked nice on her for a casual pant. i bought the \\\\\\\\\"galaxy cosmo\\\\\\\\\" leggings, and the \\\\\\\\\"dark blue\\\\\\\\\" leggings. the galaxy cosmo fits perfectly, and has a really nice, soft, stretchy fabric. the dark blue is not the same model at all. the legs are a little shorter, the waistband is different, and the material is different. i will probably be returning those in exchange for a pair more like the galaxy cosmo instead. wish the item descriptions would have made it clear that these are not all the exact same leggings in different colors/patterns. quick shipment and nice material very long. i will have to hem this in order to wear it. but i like the color and feel of the fabric. it is perfect for summer -- lightweight without being see-through or flimsy. the waist is comfortable while looking good. i like that this doesn\\'t look like pajamas, but feels as comfy as them! very nice outfit.  i bought it to wear when i travel by car or air.  it is very comfortable.  the size is true perfect. best yoga pants ever!!!!!!!!! fit perfect. fast ship. a++++ seller.. thanks 😄 💋💋💋 this for my 12 year old daughter and it fit the legs perfect, just had to tack the waist a pinch but overall, good quality and fast service very comfortable and fit well i really like the pants but it does run on the bigger side so i will purchase a size less when i order next time i wasn\\'t expecting much when i ordered these pants for a whopping $15.99, but wanted some light weight cargo pants, and dug the colors.  for the price, why not take a chance?<br />well, i\\'m happily surprised.  very comfortable, and fit my petite frame perfectly.  not a skanky too-tight, bell bottomed look, just plain ole comfortable,  i\\'d compare them to an old navy-ish quality.  i don\\'t expect these to last forever, but i\\'ll enjoy them while they hold up.  stitching and material honestly seems pretty decent.<br /><br />onto my one &#34;wtf???&#34; moment.  the brown pants, normal, as they appear.<br />regarding the orange colored pants, the mid-side cargo pocket?  yeah, that\\'s actually two pockets.  two deep narrow pockets, resting side by side.  this design choice completely confuses me, unless the manufacturer thinks their primary wearers really really like to store rulers and random rods in the side pockets, instead of a wallet or phone.  just totally baffles me.<br /><br />so...these are decent pants in fun colors that fit well and are delivered quickly, but with baffling side pockets. these are ok just for around the home. abit heavy color is good, waist abit loose. u have to keep pulling the up.. price not bad. my daughter and i love this outfit - she wears a 6 and i ordered the medium. it is so different and absolutely cute. great way to make a statement for a teen who has their \\'own\\' edgy style. these pants are so cute. i ordered like three pairs. i\\'m 5\\'5 and about 120. the pants come about six inches past my shoes when i\\'m wearing boots. i\\'m sending them back. no complaints with the seller though. shipped very fast. these pants are soft and comfy! i am getting all the different colors. they wash and dry without wrinkles! great!!! my &#34;must&#34; list for leggings:<br />affordable (under $30)<br />opaque<br />won\\'t fade after a few washes<br />medium thickness fabric (not so thin that they wear out but not so thick that you can\\'t wear in summer)<br />no camel toe<br />non-itchy material<br />non-cotton for quick dry purposes but with a soft cotton feel<br />perfect tightness/fit<br /><br />these meet all of my requirements plus they actually flatter my bod. i\\'m 5\\'7&#34; 130lb and have a long torso, no hips or butt and short muscular legs. the size small is perfection; even though they are about an inch long on me and  bunch a tiny bit at my ankle, somehow they make my legs look super long and thin!  i bought 3 black and 2 heather grey...i hope they never change the price or quality of these gems. absolutely love these pants.  wound up buying 4 different colors.  they are comfortable, look good and very affordably priced.  will not hesitate to buy more from roamans. fits good great fit! very comfortable, and great quality! great palazzo pants, wash and wear well. i love these pants.  i especially like the price and quality.  i bought several pair, some in petite and some in regular fit.  note that they do run long.  i\\'m 5\\'2 and the petite hit the bottom of my shoe, so i had to give these to my daughter who is 5\\'8 and they fit her just below where her shoe starts. fits well , cute and comfortable ... i\\'m very satisfied :) just what i needed, good quality. i have bought these pants before and i love them. very - very comfortable. able to wear to gym and can run errands in them. i run outside so perfect for outdoors. a small pocket inside lets you keep a key or you can tug your iphone in that pocket. it is dri-more technology so won\\'t stick. gives a great fit on you butt awesome, awesome!! not much more to say. i got the size, the material, the delivery, everything i was told. done deal! it fit about right the first day, but then loosened up enough that it wouldn\\'t stay up on me. it hung on to a belt just fine, so i\\'m happy continuing to use them. they are way too comfortable to stop wearing.<br /><br />the length is great on me, just like in the picture. i ordered a medium and i\\'m 5\\'5&#34;, 115lbs - i would go for a small if i was ordering again. the pants fit true to size. the legs are not a wide as i hoped. if you want the pants to look like the picture order a size up. great for running around town. i will order more colors. i ordered several colors of these slacks for work, and i love them. they are quality material and are just the right length. they fit perfect! im 5\\'7 110 lbs. i will be buying more in the future for sure. not too bad, the are very thin. they have to be ironed. the band is very soft. they are very long. for work they work. i sit 8 hours a day and the band is very comfortable.<br /><br />****update post pregnancy****<br />i could not have lived without these, i mean i wore them up until they truly fell off me and was sad to retire them. i purchased many kinds of maternity pants over the course of my pregnancy. i work at a college and had to still dress very professional. i sit for 8 hours a day. the band is very soft fabric with really no elastic. your big belly keeps it up. i bought these at 5 months and by 7 months only wore these brand until i delivered. i also wore them home. the others that had elastic in the band (old navy) were a bit tight feeling when i got larger.. i mean they didn\\'t hurt like others but the thick fold over was a bit much by the end of the day. these have light, thin, soft material.<br /><br />basically, i grew into them and grew out of all the others. again, no true elastic just your big belly does the job.<br /><br />i will say yes, they are very long (for comfort i got over that). yes, the white ones are see through (black,navy, beige were just fine!!) yes, the wrinkle .<br /><br />but for all day comfort and price.. you really can not beat it. i did not hem mine nor iron them often.. i just laid them out flat when wet and did not mind the inch that got stepped on. (neither did others / you are pregnant - do you really believe they care???do you honestly care that much vs comfort?)<br />if you have a day job.. these are the best thing you will live by. love these i love these pants! i get so many compliments while wearing them and they are super comfy these pants have a nice fabric and well made. i love the look of them and the color. unfortunately they are too small for me. i am curvy in the hip and thigh area and so they were too tight around the hips even though the waist was a little loose and the lower legs had plenty of room. something to consider depending on you body type. for someone with thin legs would work well. love these pajama pants! high quality fabric that is very soft. great fit. has held up without any issues after a few washings now. looking forward to a second pair! material is a lil thin, but comfy. i liked is perfect for my body.loved these pants are perfect for yoga or everyday activities around the house. i wear a small, it fits perfectly. i did notice they fit in length better at first, so they must be shrinking but still fit well. i bought these due to an emergency c-section and i had nothing that i could wear comfortably over my incision. the material of the pants are the same as the fold over band and fit very comfortably. i don\\'t know what i would have done without these pants! i wore them everyday! i literally washed them everyday they were so comfortable. they are also flattering (i hate when sweat pants make my lower body look bulky). the reason i gave them four stars is because the quality of the material and the sewing is not the best. the material began to wear down after just a few weeks and had formed small balls of material that could be picked easily. the inseam is also weakening. if you purchase these, expect them to only last a couple months. the med fit. but i am a 2 normally and there was no room for growth. the large would have been to big tho. these pants are not really designed for woman w curves...but nice material and as pictured. great they are nice especially for the price.  came earlier then expected too. does well just a bit long. wife loves them wears daily i ordered a large while most the time i wear med. was not sure about how it would be after washing. it did stay true to size after washing could have worn the med i am usually a medium.  tall, trim.  because of the reviews i got a 2xl.  didn\\'t want to go that big but that is all they had.  however, love it!!!! fits just right!  sure, i could have gone smaller but i don\\'t like form fitting sweats.  they are flattering and i love dressing up the pants.  comfortable - very happy! i really love this product. it was wrapped appropreitly and was worth my money. i would recommend this product to others. perfect gym outfit. the material is so good fits my body like a glove. i love the pants.  in fact, i\\'m ordering more! i loved these pants, do order one size down as they are a bit roomy. they are comfortable and do not look like yoga pants. i will definitely reorder more in different colors. the fit was fine. would have liked a heavier material. the string tie is not needed, i would order again, and recommend it to a friend. material is very clingly, runs small and shows every flaw------cellulite. nice flowing fabric. true to size (i should have bought a small) extremely well made, hood is self lined with no wrong side showing. every seam is finished off. material is lightweight and very nice. i would recommend. the zipper is a little weak but it never broke, the pants are wonderful and look great. thanks i like it got these in a medium and love them. a small would of been too tight in my opinion. i usually wear 5/6 in pants. the material is soft and it\\'s well made. made mainly out of rayon & nylon they are more like thick leggings then pants. i think they look better/more expensive in person then in the picture. considering how cheap i got them, i\\'m over the moon with my purchase. i like the bright color wear these pants with heels or be prepared to alter them to wear with flats. while the pants are pendleton\\'s, it can be a little pricey if you then have to alter the pants to wear with flats. sometimes these pants have pocket and sometimes they don\\'t. if you like pockets in your pants, make sure you check the zoom. other than that, the pants are well made and perfect for travel! love these!! i am a curvy girl i was very nervous about this purchase but it fits great i love it perfect for the fete ill be going to lol we caribbean ppl love to party and work outs or jus doing erands. the quality is great as well really comfy soft durable. nice imma buy a next one they fit well a little bit small, and to long but over all i like them no see through it cool. nice material but fits a little small great pants, exactly what i expected. the price was also great and very affordable. glad i ordered them when i did because price went back up fit is as expected, sized appropriately. seams appear good, have only worn once .... will write more if needed. excellent.. fit perfectly.  very comfortable. laundry is a breeze. no ironing ever. a little sheer so wear some skin colored panties. very flowy and long.  very comfortable.  difinatly recommend them.... look just as pictured.... love them !! i ordered the pants larger than i normally would and they actually were a great fit... glad i ordered the size i did my uniform arrived as expected. i immediately tried on and was very happy with the results , a lot if my co workers asked where did i get my new uniforms from, i did share the website ! i love these pants. i ordered my normal size and they fit perfectly. they came fasted than the expected date. i will definitely order from this seller again. i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; 160 pounds and i have a pretty curvy bottom. i ordered a large and they fit perfect. they are pretty low rise but are a very nice thick fabric so you don\\'t have to worry about them being see through. the length fits me perfect so if you are taller than 5\\' 5&#34; and are really leggy i\\'d be careful ordering these. other than that these are great and i\\'ll totally be ordering another pair:) after reading the other reviews, i was rather hesitant to order. however, i decided to form my own opinion. i actually love these pants. my only complaint is the lenght....but i\\'m about 5\\'2, so i guess the issue is my genes, aye!? other than me having to get them hemmed, they\\'re worth the purchase. absolutely love!! after reading reviews i ordered an xl, i\\'m 5\\'6 150lbs and i should of ordered a large but they are so comfy and cute i\\'ll definitely be ordering more. great price, great pants!! they are awesome, i love them!! the only thing wrong was, when i got them there was no hole for the button, but i cut one out so i can button it now, and it is fine. also they run very small!!! the only reason they fit me as expected is because i read the reviews and figured i must buy a larger size. i am a size 1-3 and the large fit me perfect! alittle smaller than i thought i will buy more. comfortable, durable. transforms your body...love the look and feel these cat pants are the greatest thing that have ever happened to me.  talk a about a conversation starter.  i am 6\\'1&#34; and weigh 160 and they fit fantastic. but they are a little tight on my nuts.  the cats have upside down crosses on their foreheads but who am i to judge the religious beliefs of  those little pussies? very comfortable. love the material. package came fast! fits like a glove.  be sure to check out the sizing chart as i had to order a size up or it wouldn\\'t have fit through the bust area.  i was a little nervous going up a size as i figured the bottom part would be huge but it wasn\\'t.  one of the prettiest jumpsuits i have ever had. very comfortable, stylish, and affordable.  they aren\\'t the best quality, but for the price, they are fantastic. the fit is maybe slightly small with the top compared to other brands in the same size, but overall, i\\'m satisfied. these are very nice and comfortable. the quality and fabric are as expected and i am very pleased with them. i received this baggy harem pants  in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, the shipping was fast and it was packaged securely. the size fit as expected with many sizes and colors to choose from. it was comfortable to wear and made of durable soft comfortable materials. didn\\'t shrink or fade in the washer and dryer.a nice product from diamondkit  . i would recommend this trusted company and their products to all my friends i always have difficulty finding pants that fit my large butt and are long enough. these fit perfectly, drape beautifully and they are very roomy. i even where them out in public! since i discovered these jeans i bought close to 10 of them in different colors. wonderful fit. lifting butt &#34;powers&#34; as i call them. hahahaha. i would recomend these jeans to anyone. note to seller: please make boot cut jeans in more color options for summer. i have black and white, cream is not my color and those are the only 3 options. thank you these pants could easily sell for $30-60 or more; they are extremely reasonably priced for such soft comfortable thick cotton... they are the most comfortable workout pants ever with a very functional wide elastic waistband that makes the drawstring ties almost unnecessary. they fall well and are easy to move and bend and stretch and hang around in... really smartly designed for movement and ease. great pomegranite color, speedy delivery and customer service was good. wasn\\'t sure about the sizing: s is about 2-4 women\\'s, true to size. i like them. some people said they didn\\'t show through though and they do im not even that big and they are see through in some spots. they are fine though with shorts or a skirt. the colors are cool too. id buy another pair since there are tons these pants are truly cut for small and or slender frames.  with all the cargo pockets etc, these pants will add bulk.  their size small (27) is at least an us 0 if not a 00. i paid for a royal blue and received a dull navy blue i just got my shorts on the mail and i tried them on and they fit absolutely perfect and cute, they are so comfortable, the material is awesome, stretchy and the flower print is soooo adorable. highly recommended i\\'m so happy i will buy more. im 5&#34;2 and i usually wear size s but i ordered size m for these shorts and worked out great! these are soooo comfortable. not tight like i expected from scrubs. would wear them every day if i had more pairs. my wife doesn\\'t agree with some of the reviews - she is thin & they look great on her ! its nice but it doesn\\'t fit as well as the petite small i have. this doesn\\'t have a petite size so i gave them 4 stars but i love the pants. good quality. i love these pants!!  they fit just right - many times &#34;small&#34; is xxs or xs - but these are a great fit - so comfortable.  i have been trying to find a replacement for a retail store brand have been using for years that has been discontinued.  the material is so soft - kind of like t-shirt material - except only slightly heavier.  love the length.<br /><br />have been wearing to go to stores and around home.  even bought more in other colors.  haven\\'t worn for yoga yet but am sure they\\'ll be great. nice grea romper i love it very pleased when i opened the package. i\\'m looking forward when the weather gets warmer so i can wear it very comfortable.  love em. very soft comfy pants. i think i read some other reviews or the size guide and decided to get an xl but i think i would have been better off getting the large so i think perhaps it runs a bit large. i think i may have these double as my yoga pants. they really are comfortable and it feels almost like next to nothing on your skin. i actually did not realise they were this light in fact, so that was a surprise to me, but not necessarily a bad one. just that it did change (completely) where i would wear them.<br /><br />also, it came with a surprise gift in the package which i really appreciated and look forward to using. a little tight but they are lovely. very cute and they came very quick. very satisfied with my purchase love the color but fit is slight small<br />i order an xl and fit like a large<br />need it for work but will do yes these are made of acetate and are extremely delicate.  but they drape wonderfully and if cared for gently, will last a long time! had to get them altered at the waist and hymned at the bottom. i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; and 120lbs they were exactly what i wanted!  mostly cotton with enough elastic in the fabric so the knees stayed tight.  i\\'m hoping i can get them in more colors.  i found them to be true to size and i\\'d recommend them highly. good fitting love the color smooth, soft, and comfortable! i love these pants!! so comfy i could live in them, just ordered a bunch of new pairs in different patterns and colors!! these pants are beautiful. they seem to be made very well and are not sheer like so many of the other cheaper palazzos that i\\'ve ordered. i like them so much that i\\'m going to see if they have them in black, as well as white. and maybe even chocolate! they are a bit big in the waist but not so much so that they\\'re not wearable. and ordering down a size doesn\\'t seem to be an option, as the tag inside says 2x/3x. but overall, i\\'m very happy with them and would recommend them. these are cute pants! my husband thought they are wonderful! i just wish i had a tag in mine so i could make sure i take care of them properly. they are comfy, but they may be big on me because they keep sliding down. overall, i do like these pants, they are flattering and unique leggings. they fit well, except there is not really any elastic in the waist, so they fall down pretty easily, i think i am going to sew some elastic to the inside is target sending out more of these pants?  please do because some of us can\\'t find any more! :( these pants fit better than expected. i am 5&#34;8 and they are long on me. that is a super rare thing to find at my height and usually a concern when ordering things offline that i haven\\'t tried on. i am super pleased with these. i bought them for my new job and couldn\\'t be happier. these are my favorite palazzo pants! they have the fold over elastic waist and they are really silky/soft. i am required to have navy scrubs for my school uniform, i bought the indigo color and they are perfect.  i ordered the tall.  i am 5\\'7&#34; and approx 130lbs.  the small are actually a bit too big. i will order the xsmall next time. just as i wanted i love these pants!!! they are light-weight linen that you can dress up and dress down casual. i just ordered 2 more pairs and i plan on wearing them throughout the summer. had a pair on with a sheer tunic yesterday and matching sandals and i got tons of compliments these are amazingly well made, look just like the picture and long enough for me. what can i say? great price and now i have a pair of favorite pants.. they are thin fabric, which is perfect for those days in louisiana when it is hot, warm, or just plain ole normal. fits me perfectly.  very good material and very comfortable they are not stitched well enough to wear to work and they are pretty thin but i think i will wear them at festivals and shows this summer.  they are comfortable but a bit snug on my hips - but i have wide hips. overall i like them - wish they came in a petite/short so i could order more colors.  i think the pink would look horrible after being worn once and dragging on the ground. my initial review was for these pants sold by bco, but it is the \\'outlet\\' for jessica london, woman within, and roaman\\'s.  i got them for only 3.99, since i wasn\\'t willing to pay much, as returns are a pistol (you pay 7.50 per return, but that includes the postage, return label inside -- never do it any other way, as you\\'ll be charged in any event).<br /><br />with washing and drying -- even in hot water, and highest cotton setting -- they become much softer as time passes.  they don\\'t shrink.  material is mid-weight or even heavy cotton, but it\\'s a poly/cotton mix.  so, i expected pilling.  none, so far.<br /><br />order a size down if your belly isn\\'t big.  waist is much too high, but you can cut the waist and re-use the elastic.<br /><br />pants are free flowing, thin poor-boy style ribbing.  good finish, sewing, sheen (not shiny, but not unfinished, either). these pants are a godsend! if you are a fan of yoga pants, i can\\'t recommend them enough. i love wearing these when i\\'m out doing my errands! these feel like lounge wear, but are so stylish! i have more of a \\'boys figure\\' (no hips, medium waste), 5\\'5 115lbs. they could be more snug and may stretch out to be baggy but i love them. swimming in them in the lap pool every day. if you are tall-they may be too short! they are very soft and comfy. i really love this jumpsuit.  the fit was better than i expected. i completely love it. i\\'ve tried other jumpsuit and they usually don\\'t look right with my body type. this one did. as others have posted, this pants are slightly long (i am 5\\' 6&#34; and the legs drag under shoes), but they are comfortable. i like<br />the drawstring. however, there are no pockets, which is listed in the ad. for the price i paid i have no disappointment. they have ]<br />washed well with no real shrinkage or fading. these leggings are soft cotton, well-made, and do not give me muffin top -- they are not low-waisted. fit great other than crouch fit weird they are so cute !! i just wish they would stretch a bit more. i have a 27 waist and 38 butt and bought a small, the fit pretty well. perfect actually better quality than i expected! fast fast delivery too these are very comfy and fit well. they look really nice so i can wear them to work out or wear them to work with a nice sweater and flats. perfect fit! love, love these pants! i ordered a size up, and fit perfectly! i\\'m 5\\'4&#34;, and didn\\'t have to him them at all! hubby loves these and i love these.  i got them because i was tired of his horrible mis-matching.  for example, red and blue plaid pj bottoms with a green and yellow tshirt.  this pj bottoms are like jeans, any t-shirt looks okay with them!<br /><br />i no longer cringe if the neighbors see him taking out the trash saturday morning, or checking the mail. item arrived on time and exactly as described.  fits perfectly and is durable.  have had the item for over a year and i am extremely satisfied. love them! super comfy and cute. careful after you wash them (by hand) they seem to shrink up a little, but i think the fabric just needs to be pulled out a little. and the waist length is completely adjustable! perfect summer slacks, can be dressed up for the office or dinner out, or go casual, could be year round if tights or legging were wore under for warmth. washes well and drys fast.<br />this item comes from uk so it takes a long time to get here. i got these two years ago, too--i\\'m tempted to get another pair just because they\\'re great. here\\'s what i mean: 1) every day i come home from work and put on a pair of &amp;quot;house pants.&amp;quot; these are a favorite choice in the winter, and are some of the most long-lasting, comfortable, and warm ones i have. 2) 2 years ago, i had to use a special skin medicine on my leg that (unfortunately, though predictably) bleached out part of the pattern on the pants. now, that might not sound like an endorsement, but hear me out: i decided to wash the pants with my bleached laundry, hoping to fade the rest of the pattern &amp; camoflauge the damage. it didn\\'t work. i tried it again. out of habit, i have been bleaching these pants about 15 washes per year and they still have not faded and still have held up! they\\'re a great bargain and very cute. amazing pants. fit perfectly and incredibly comfortable and look great. i ordered it a little bigger than i should have but i love the feel of the fabric and the fit is loose and comfy for me.. im 5\\'9&#34; 150 lbs and ordered an xl i could have gotten the lg but i like my clothes loose.. i think its a great product for the price and fast shipping.. thank you :) exactly as expected. excellent workmanship too! great communication from seller. will buy again in as many colors as possible! thank you! exactly what i expected excelente.! pants a little long hemming took care of it. this is comfortable and i love it!!! i want 20 of these in different paterns!! :) beautiful fit! great pair of pants. comfortable but still looks polished and put together; these will be my go-to clothing item this summer! arrived quickly and in perfect condition. these yoga pants are soft, breathable and stretchy! i ordered a medium (i wear size 8 pants) and they are a bit snug in the hips but otherwise fit well. very comfortable pants! great i love these pants! super comfy and great material! love them even though i have some things i\\'d change overall i love the flexibility of these leggings!<br />they are high waisted and i have a short torso so i fold these down however they do cover when i\\'m at the gym! not see through!<br />these are thinner and are not compression, but if you have muscular legs like me you will love these! i normally wear between a s/m and i\\'m 5\\'3. length is fine. i actually think taller girls would like them too, i pull my tights up on the thighs before squatting and even then they still go down. i love how flexible they can be! only warning is if you have any jiggle in your legs it will show. they look fabulous on the glutes! these actually look good! and they cover my not tiny behind. i would strongly sugest a belt, they will slid down your behind, but with a regular belt ive had no problems. very cool looking for someone not tiny. the front side of your thiegh will sweat, but i remember my real leather pants always fit like a second skin. at least these you can pull down when you need to pee.lol i am absolutely in love with these pants.  the days when i have to wash them, i just spend time longing to be in them.  i bought the sensible black in medium.  i found them to be a little roomy, but this is absolutely not a problem.  i wear them to work, shopping, to yoga, to the gym, to parties...i haven\\'t mooned myself yet:)  *update as of 03-03-15*  just bought another batch, and they are waaaayyyy longer than the first 3 orders i placed.  not sure what happened-but i definitely did not grow&gt; luv these!!!!!!!!<br /><br />super soft!!!! look great on!!!!<br /><br />from my experience, i would suggest ordering your normal size in these.  i ordered an xl.  the sizing chart says that is for 16/18 or up to 45.5 inches hips.  i measure 47.5  inches at the hip and 38 on the waist.  these things are comfy and fit perfect.  i ordered the xl because in general, 2x is more times than not way too big on me, even when the sizing charts say i should order it.  from my experience, i would suggest ordering your normal size in these.<br /><br />now i know the product image shows thin legs, but let me testify that they are stretchy and will and do look and feel great on the fuller thigh.  they are long for my 5\\'3 height but they are not wrapping up under my heels...they just touch the ground while in bare feet with about 1/4-1/2 dragging.  i just fold the waist a bit more if wearing flats or barefoot and do not have a problem.<br /><br />they wash nicely: i use cold to wash and low heat to dry or hang them when able.  i do not see any shrinkage.  it does show wrinkles when folded messily in the drawer.  i recommend hanging it (they have those soft colorless hanger thingys in the seams) or fold them neatly and lay flat.<br /><br />i bought a second pair and will buy more soon (first was the black+white, second rust and i get complements on both). they are a little long,  but that\\'s probably because i\\'m a little short. :-)  unbelievably comfortable though, and they make my butt look fantastic! good quality, looks nice would recommend i like the fit, they are a little tight on my thighs but are plenty stretchy. very see through! as expected.... but i bought them for a color run to dye them for cute work out pants. worked perfectly. i bought these for a family trip, my wife loves the design, the color and quality are exactly as described. but these pants are slim fit, it\\'s narrow near the hip and thigh. keep in mind they are &#34;asian size&#34;,  order one size larger. i love these pants! got so many compliments, my client even ordered some for herself. the material is nice and thick and the size chart from the company....not amazon\\'s...was on point. i bought my first pair kind of baggy...and i ordered a second pair a size smaller for a less loose look. i love these! i ordered the blue paisley because they have the highest cotton content and i have no tolerance for synthetic-feeling fabrics. these are awesome... cottony soft but still stylish enough to pull off at work with a professional top. i was nervous about the sizing because i\\'m a full-figured woman (usually wear a 12-14 in pants) and the large size here was out of stock. i gambled with a medium, and i\\'m glad i did because they\\'re actually a little roomy, and the large would have been frumpy. i would suggest that folks order a size down from what the size chart indicates, based on my experience. very fast shipping... i mean like a few days! i\\'m super stoked with this purchase. loved them so much i ordered another color.<br />cute with no hem at the bottom and so comfortable. high quality material.  great fit.  super investment. bought it for my daughter. she loves it. these pants are awesome! they are long so i have to hem them up but otherwise they are very nice. these are amazing!! the pants fit me so very well, almost as if they were made for my body type. i love the steam punk accents! i ordered the small size, they fit me perfect, i am 5&#34;3 and 130 pounds. i ordered 4 more for my dougthers these are beautiful slacks, lined and gorgeous!! sadly they do not fit as i\\'d hoped. they are a bit tight around the waist and they\\'re longer than i\\'d like, so off too the seamstress !! the quality of these leggings is great!  i ordered the m/l as well as the l/xl.  i\\'ll keep them both as i am in serious diet mode...  nonetheless, i am 5\\'3&#34; and about 148 lbs the m/l is a bit snug but should fine once another 10-15 lbs have been shed and the l/xl fit beautifully.  the rise on the jean is great all the way up to my belly button, which is great for eliminating that muffin top... awesome gift for a friend of mine. she loves the pants :)my friend had a pair of these pants about a year ago and she saw the pink ones and just loved the color so i had to get them for her even though they hang off of my hips, and i have to cut the bottoms because i\\'m 5.3, i still love them. they are super lightweight and comfy. i wish they had more colors and smaller petite sizes. my daughter loves these leggins!! i fell in love with these pants and ordered a second pair. i got purple and then green/yellow. i prefer the purple. i\\'m 5\\'9&#34; and 135 lbs and they fit me nicely. i use them as lounge pants/pajamas. the fabric is a gorgeous heavy weight silk. stunning to think they originally sold for $298. they are not lined & after three wears, the stitching at the waist tab came undone. love cluny designs, but certainly wait until they are on sale. quality does not equal full pricing. fast shipping, and even greater quality! these leggings are a must buy and i highly recommend. true to size, and guys will love to see you in them. slims the waist, and you can rock these with a crop top or any other top you like. this is fashion at it\\'s best : ) these are great, they look amazing and are super adorable, and now i get to have cats on my butt woo!<br />they shipped yesterday and got here today! this jumpsuit make me feel confident and skinny, get a lot of compliment really recommend this black jumpsuit because it kind of thin material excellent i love them-- great for summer and workouts.  i would avoid putting them in the dryer, and use warm not hot water and a gentle cycle.  for ten bucks, they will probably have the same lifespan as other, more expensive cotton yoga pants.  fit is great; follow the sizing chart. very comfortable, love the side pockets! it does run a bit short on my 5\\'3 frame though, which is something i rarely have to say. the pants are very lose and lightweight but the waist band does sit a bit strangely. i like tucking shirts or blouses into the waist band, although you have to be careful about it rolling down when you sit. love the print. the material is thin, but i think with the pattern it disguises and potential see through. the sizing seems to be smaller than you would think so order a size up. longer in the top and legs than expected,  but very comfortable and stylish. awesome yoga pants :) fit well and look great! they are just right and i like the fabric. i like it get tons of looks and compliments when i wear to the gym! loves! great fit very pleased with these slacks. came promptly and as expected. to small i personally liked the pants. i\\'m an average height (5\\' 4\\'\\'-5 5\\'\\') and the length worked out perfectly for me. but i can see how it can be a problem for someone taller than me. love it i love it love these pants, great for mia super comfortable. i will order more of these. fit was great, very nice quality!  just what i wanted. will order more when i need more for exercise class. wonderful feel and quality!  the pocket is a very nice added feature! i wear a size 10: 5\\'4&#34; and 140# and the medium was a perfect choice! the linen was very soft and felt nice to skin.  i got the medium and fit just snug with low waist - i usually take a size 6-8 pants, so i think the medium is more for junior sizing.  the length tho is long - i had to take up the hem even tho i usually can get away with a 32\\\\\\\\\" inseam when i wear my platforms.  but overall great linen pants! bought these prior to a recent vacation. they are nice looking, lightweight material.  they seemed to run a little on the smaller size, so you may want to be conservative with sizing. i live in hawaii all year round, so i am able to wear these ruched crop leggings all year round.  i have them in different colors and they are wonderful. i choose 5 stars cuz i recieved a bit earlier then expe ted and the pants are very comfortable and i love them.they stretch out to fit your body prefectly. i\\'m ordering another because i like them so much! i\\'m a size 8 and the mediums fit me perfectly. looks good on but slightly smaller than expected. like the style and the pants are a true length. would buy again but i would buy a larger size. the fabric is thin, but i love the way it hangs. no sewing to hem...just cut...straight. this is a very sexy pair of black pants! i\\'ve worn theory for years. this is an expensive brand that cuts for a european market. this means your hips are small and you\\'re not carrying any extra body weight. the quality is always excellent - beautifully made inside and out. you don\\'t buy theory for a season. they are classics that you wear forever. theory doesn\\'t make many casual pants so when i saw these i couldn\\'t believe it. i also thought they were going to be a knock-off because the price is so low. not so. they are the genuine article - classy detailing.<br />if you don\\'t have a lot of leg, you\\'re in luck. the pant leg is meant to be turned up which gives it a wonderful little-boy look. don\\'t go by the color in the picture. they are a warm sandy beige - good with black or white top.<br />i\\'ll be checking amazon regularly for theory pants, etc., from now one. sorry bloomingdales! they arrived super fast and the day after they arrived we got a snow storm. these pants kept me very dry, warm and toasty. they were a little bit big but that is ok because you can wear a light pant underneath. they were about 1\\\\\\\\\" too long but that is fixable. they are awesome. i am very pleased with them and will look into getting other arctix products. at first they were hard to get into, but now they fit like a glove. looks very elegant, love it, it fits good. i am having a size 4 and it fits very good. the delivery was very fast and i had no problem at all. we ordered the pants for use in a play and they worked out great - good fit and very comfortable. perfect for my workouts. fits as expected i bought a 3x and they fit as a 3x. i am very pleased and will be ordering from this supplier again. love it loved it! so comfortable..colors, pattern, quality... everything just perfect..and how about that single pocket! so lovely! i gave these jeans a 4-star only because i am tall (5\\'8) and the jeans were a bit short for me. i have long legs and i kind of expected them to be a bit short, most jeans are, but the fit is great and the material is very soft yet very controlling at the same time. if you are 5\\'7 or shorted these would be the perfect length for you. i will still wear them with flat shoes so it is not a loss. i wish they came in tall sizes. little bit long legs other then that fits bought a large through would have been fine with a medium (maybe even a small) - but i like the looser fit anyway! very cozy and cute. just wish there were pockets! i am 5\\'5 and weigh 127lbs. i ordered a small they fit perfect, they are on the long side which i prefer over to short. i absolutely love these pants and got compliments all day at work. i ordered two more. i definitely recommend these pants. vey comfortable! excellent my friend,  who i got this for, at first refused to wear them. called them &#34;see through&#34;. eventually though she got to the end of her laundry and this was the last thing left. so, reluctantly, she put them on. they fit well, and to her surprise they didn\\'t show through. she found they moved with her well, and was quite happy with them after her run. that works! these are the best delicate, esthetically beautiful superb pair of lady pants. these pants are silky and they feel even better than silk because it is slightly thicker than silk. it becomes part of you, so natural. i am 5\\'6&quot; and i am a bit overweight. i usually wear large for pants, and it hides those extra pounds extremely well. the only thing is you have to treat them like silk because you want them to last forever, believe me. this is how i care for these pants.<br />- i soak them with cold water and one tableapoon of liquid soap and 1/4 cup of white vinegar in the sink or a plastic container for about an hour, and then i rinse the pants with cold water. once the pants are rinsed, i lightly wring it and  i place a towel flat on a table and i lay the pants on top of the towel. then i roll the towel with the pants inside into a sausage shape, so the dry gently inside the towel. i wait about ten minutes, and i then take the pants out. and, that\\'s how i gently care for these pair of pants. i love them and i will be buying more. the price is right as well. i love these pants! they easily slip on over jeans. i wear them on rainy damp days when walking the dog, and frigid cold days in single digits. good for shoveling snow, easy to bend in great buy and good material. these pants fits perfect i usuauly wear medium so i got small to medium they fit perfect not to small or tight just the right size and they look exactly like as pictured great looking leggings!  i got lots of compliments on  4th of july! nice and comfortable.  it was super to find these in brown.  everything is always black or grey or some really loud color.  thanks for offering these in a nice brown.  this color goes with so many things.  shipping was quick and the pants are nice enough, that i would buy them again. love where the waistband sits, so comfortable. this was a great fine! it hard to fine palazzo fashion pants in beautiful designs. these pants are comfortable and fit so well. great to travel in and they came in so many beautiful designs. i love the pants as well as the color they was exactly how i was expecting, the size was good, the color dont lose them shinny . so u can buy it. it\\'s always nice to hear you look good...especially when you\\'re also comfortable! these pants (specifically with this pattern) look dressed-up, but feel dressed-down. excellent price too...gotta love that! so far as the fit and material...i wear a 14-16 in jeans and the large fits great. they are nice and long, so i can wear my big heels...and very thin and breathable fabric. the pattern is an applique, so they\\'re not dryer-friendly, but they don\\'t take long to air-dry! highly recommend. these pants are soft and comfortable. just want i wanted.  they wash and dry nicely too. the quality is pretty good, only thing that i didn\\'t like is that the waist band elastic was kinda loose so my pants slide down a little when i do squats or jump up and down. i love these pants! i bought them in black and will probably buy some of the other colors. they are very comfortable. the linen is soft yet sturdy. i wear them around the house but have also dressed them up for a christmas party. all-around great pants! great fit - hits me just below my knees as i am 5\\'3&#34; - but i combined this with a kanu surf women\\'s breeze swim tee.  they look great together and i can now feel comfortable at the pool! slightly over one year ago, i started exercising more frequently.  i had to have something more durable and applicable to gym equipment.  these do not get stuck in any equipment.  the short length allows one to wear them under work clothing.<br /><br />i now have a pretty good collection of these with other gym shirts of various colors (black matches everything).  and, i regularly go to the gym on hot days or jog with my dog on cooler days with these capri pants.  the inner thigh area is protected by the smooth and comfortable material when running.<br /><br />they wick sweat off the body, keep a firm but comfortable waistline, and are ok to wear all year long.<br />this is one of my favorite brands.<br /><br />i recommend that you order a size larger than normal. exactly what i was hoping for. soft and comfy and still look classy.<br />i do like blair clothing it\\'s a gift of my friend. my friend like it. perfect fit and style just right this pans fits perfectly!!! i just wear them around the house. they are extremely comfortable and very cute very fast shipping.  shorts are very cute but size small.  i\\'m 26in waist with 38in hip and thunder thigh to follow; therefore i recommend if you\\'re pear shaped, to size up.  i\\'ll definitely order again i\\'m 5\\'4&#34; and they have a little extra slack, which is good for tall people, i suppose. love them!! i\\'m a large but decided to get a medium and they got perfectly! really happy with my purchase! great price, material is a little stiff will update after washing it.<br />i\\'m 5\\'4&#34; and wear size 10 pants and the medium fit perfectly. it\\'s very cute but not inappropriate for casual wear during the summer. the wrap belt makes it very flattering and there is a side zipper so it\\'s easier to get into than some rompers. if the top is too loose you can wear a cami underneath for more coverage. ( the top is not sewen together so depending on the fit for you it could slide of your shoulders) great this color at fit are my favorite! great pants, fit well, came on time, no issues. they fit good... wear them around the house every day! on time as expected i ordered large i\\'m 5\\'4 size18 pants wow i love it... these are very nice capri pants. i paired mine up with some cute wedge heels.. def a go! fyi i wear size 8.. i purchased a size 13 ,do to the other reviews and i am glad i did , because the cut is small on this style camo capri so please go up at least 2 sizes if not 3. showed up on time very happy they are very sexy very comfortable, will definetely order some more. tad bit long but i\\'m short so i rarely find things that are just the right length. very comfortable. i purchased one pair in to try for size and comfort and i was pleasantly surprised. i am 5 \\\\\\\\\"11 and have trouble finding pants long enough, i purchased the medium tall, and the length is great!! not too short. they are very comfortable and wash/dry very easily-if taken from the dryer promptly there is no need to iron. consequently, i have purchased a navy  pair. i wish they made a kahki color due to a new job dress requirement. i was afraid they\\'d b a little too small but they fit perfectly. i have no concerns about these  pants. have washed them over 5 times ,the\\'re still in piece, look nice :)<br />im 5\\'0 87 pounds the pants fit great and are super comfortable for both work and casual wear. i highly recommend them. they were perfect ty. so much !!!! just received my leggings, over a week before the estimated delivery date even! the fabric is nice, shiny, seems durable, and is comfortable to wear. the image printed has deep, rich color, and is even better than expected. i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; and about 105lbs and they fit very well, even with a bit of wrinkling at the bottom. thanks! love it i bought these for my mom and she has a little larger waist but is very petite otherwise.  i usually have to alter all her slacks a little.  i like the material and the softness. good i am 5\\'11\\\\\\\\\" and sometimes finding pjs is a bit difficult. these are awesome! super comfy and with the cuff, i can even make them longer if needed. i got the blue and green plaid which were very cute and after receiving ordered 2 more pairs! :) i have many styles of these miss me jeans.  they are so cute! plus they are very fitting and match well with a number of my styles. terrific jeans. loved these pants very comfortable! i was lucky - the pants fit perfectly!  they look expensive, and the linen doesn\\'t wrinkle as much as other linen pants i own. again the wife loves it they fit great and are comfortable. i\\'m buying more of them. great pattern and color.  material (rayon) is very thin but good for hot weather.  pants are perfect for lounging yet nice enough to wear out.  could be a bit bigger through crotch but waist is very comfy & adjustable (i\\'m a sz 14). happy with my purchase. comfortable and nice to lift in. i love these pants! the fit is great and they are very comfortable! i absolutely love these pants...they fit so perfectly as i am a short woman 5\\'2 and i have a nice sized butt...i usually end up regretting getting clothes online but not with this...my only complaint is that there aren\\'t anymore colors to choose from...if there were i\\'d order them all... okay, these are amazing. way better in person!! the colours and designs are very cool. they fit perfect also. as in, i\\'m a normal size person, not a stick figure and they\\'re awesome. [[videoid:dcb45ad5ef6038cc2ffbf8ff50eb75c7]]these are nice yoga pants.  they are very soft and comfortable.  the material is stretchy, and they have a lot of room in the legs with the wide leg pattern.  the material is thin enough that it allows great airflow, but isn\\'t so thin that you can see through it unless you hold it away from your body.  the stitching seems good, and the pants feel to be quality clothing.  these look nice enough that i could easily wear these out with nice shoes and a nice top.  i could also use them for my yoga exercise.<br /><br />i received this discounted in exchange for my review. wonderful! love them fits perfect. fits really great!  it bunches in the crotch area.  other than that they are perfect! so soft and smooth! the bottom of the legs are big but i knew that would be something to deal with because of the description. i cant bring myself to cut or hem them because i would loose the design. i think they are a little pricey but nice to have. these pants are not large so much as they are long.  really long.  i hemmed mine a good six inches, and they\\'ve been fine.<br /><br />the same pants in the next size smaller were much too tight, and even they were a little long.<br /><br />these yoga pants are very comfortable in class, and when bicycling to and from yoga class.  they take a long time to drip dry. im 5\\'7, 175lbs, and size 12. i ordered the x large pants to allow myself some wiggle room. the pants arrived on time and i am absolutely in love with them.  they feel so good.  a little loose in the waist but overall the length runs to the floor and i have a great boho style pant.  im on my way to ordering another print.  these are fantastic. i love the fit of these pants.  they are the only style i wear right now.  the length is perfect, they fit good at the waist and stay in place, i\\'m not constantly pulling them up. shipping was fast and as expected. i bought these for my mom, who has a petite pear shaped body (5\\'3&#34;) and the fit was great. the color black washed nicely, became super soft and remained richly dark. these pants are so cute.  they have the strectch fit that is in style.  they go perfect with those pointed toe boots that are in all the shoe stores now. professional while still being really cute and trendy.  the only thing that i did not like about them is that the seam goes all the way from the top of the pant to the bottom.  it is okay in the front but i dont like that in the back.  they are still a keeper. sizing was a little off, but they still feel good. love...super cute.. i weigh about 100lbs...5\\'6&#34;...fit well.. i received my pink scrub set today. tried them on and very impressed. such a good price for what you are getting. the size was as expected. i am 5\\'5&#34; and 220lb. i wear size 16 jeans. i ordered xl and they fit great. i like mine to not be tight so that i can move around to do cares as a cna. i did some squats in them and they don\\'t pull anywhere. so overall top and bottom are a little baggy, but this is what i prefer. just enough room to move in but not to much that i look like i\\'m swimming. love it love them. very comfortable. love it these are a little tight right now but i am pregnant so im not surprised. i hope they will fat post pregnancy. they are soft and i imagine they will be very comfortable. color is exactly as shown in the picture. shipped incredibly fast! somewhat small first off, i love these pants!!! way too cute, but like other folks have said, they do run very small. i\\'m in a size 5 pant and they fit snug but comfortable. the material is thin, but not flimsy so it\\'s all good. love these pants!  they can be casual and even worn in the office with cute shoes and a blazer! i need them in every color so i can wear them everyday. i got them 1 size larger than i normally would wear and they are perfect, classy and comfortable the person who received these as a gift is 5\\'7&#34;, and she would have liked them to be longer- to go pass her ankles. otherwise they are great. very soft, comfortable fitting pants. my only complaint is that they\\'re a bit long for someone 5\\'3&#34; (and 130 lbs), even in heels, so i\\'ll probably have to shorten them a bit. but otherwise they\\'re good pants. love it the material is a little thinner than i thought it would be, but overall it\\'s pretty flattering. as long as you don\\'t wear bright underwear. have had a really hard time finding \\\\\\\\\"mature fit\\\\\\\\\" workout pants.  these are keepers.  they are med weight, not too form-fitting, hug the waist without gap, yet generous through hips and thighs. slight boot cut, which i was looking for. fit and cut is true to picture, or would be if i were 5\\'3 - at 5\\'4 they barely skim top of shoes - but i didn\\'t want \\\\\\\\\"street\\\\\\\\\" length, these are ok.    only real complaint - i  purchased \\'coral\\', which looked more toward on the pink side in the ad; however, actual color was closer to tangerine, a stretch to call it coral, and nowhere near what it looks like online.    overall, i really like the fit and feel, and the amazon price was def right.  recommend these. i liked this, but i do have long legs so they fit me a little short and looks a bit odd. other than the length, i quite liked this. exactly what the wife was looking for, they fit her great and she loves them. pretty soft pants .... look great on.  length is perfect on me ... i am 5\\' 1&#34; so tall girls need to consider this.  i weigh 120 and the smocked elastic waist is very comfortable.  i love that they are light weight and thin for my new mexico summers.  shipped fast and wrapped with care, other than being a tad big this top is great. it moves with you, perks up plain navy and stays pretty much wrinkle free. great jammies bottoms! i received my pants and wore them within a few days. i love them! they are super comfortable, flowy, and airy, perfect for wearing when the weather is warm. they have shorts under them and below is very sheer. i\\'m thinking about buying some more in different colors. i bought the light blue and it\\'s very vibrant. when the pants first arrived, they seemed scratchy, but once you start wearing them it isn\\'t bothersome. i really enjoy these as cool pants to wear around the house (instead of sweat pants), but they wrinkle easily and the waist band is rather loose so they were not ideal for wearing out and about. these pants were exacly what i wanted and expected. this sixe fits me perfectly. they are super comfy and cute. great pant for casual wear. these pants are great and comfortable. they fit perfectly. i normally wear a size 16 and some 18 so i ordered the xxlarge size and they fit just right. i will be ordering more. great washed and just like new i love these comfy yoga/lounge pants.  so many of them lose their shape easily - especially at the knees - but these retain their shape very well and are priced great! i love them just a cover up.. very slimming, and flattering....i wear a 2xl and actually fit in this large.  my body shape is hourglass.  i wish they had this in black and navy.  it doesn\\'t wrinkle and is lightweight. i\\'m so happy i didn\\'t listen to the other reviewers on this one...which i don\\'t do often. these shorts fit me perfectly. i am 5\\'3 about 115lbs and are super cute. i bought them as a medium (that\\'s what it said before i purchased)  but after i bought them i looked at them again and the page changed the wording to say a small and there is not a sizing tag....so i\\'m not sure what size they actually are. but they fit! and i cant wait for the 4th so i can rock them. also i was worried it would be waxy on the flag design part, but it\\'s not all all. the entire garmet is made solely of jean material. only complaint is that they do smell a lil bleachy, but it\\'s not a deal breaker. i was just telling a friend of mine how much i live these pants! they are so soft and comfortable i literally did not take them off the day i got them.  i put a blue tank top on and wore them everywhere.  i absolutely love the fabric it\\'s soft and stretchy but breathable which is what i need in this florida heat.<br /><br />i received this product at a reduced cost in exchange for my personal and unbiased review. these pants are amazing on and so unique in appearance. they fit according to size and launder nicely. the material is a perfect weight. i like the pants, they are cute.  they are made of good material too.  the only thing i would say is they run small.  you might want to buy one size up, i did and it worked for myself. looks great especially over the rump which is hard to find in maternity clothes. material has the perfect amount of give and compression. these leggings looked and fit like they do in the picture.  they\\'re a little bit shinier than i would have liked not because i expected them to look differently, i was just hoping they might be a little more matte.  i was a little concerned about only having two sizes - medium and large.  i\\'m 115 with basically no hips so i ordered the medium and it fit perfectly.  i haven\\'t washed them yet so i\\'m not sure how they\\'ll hold up over the long haul but  my only complaint (again, it is visible in the pictures so not a surprise) is that the seam runs down the center instead of down the legs so you have a seam right down your crotch.  i don\\'t think it would be noticeable in the black. nice quality. love the product!!! fitted smaller then i was expecting but they are extremely comfortable. they also are very long and i am nearly 5\\'8. overall they are great and i will most likely order more but in a larger size. i love these tights! they do fall a little but for the price and thickness i can\\'t complain. i love these pants.  they are great quality and wash well.  i find them more comfortable than other scrubs at least in part because the waistline is lower more like my everyday pants. i\\'m 5\\'5 and 155 pounds at 8.5mos pregnant. i bought a size small. these are super comfy but they get really big in the legs throughout the day. these are so soft and comfy! they feel a lot like a tshirt, soft with a little give. i agree with a few other reviews that they aren\\'t a snug fit. and probably wouldn\\'t do for jogging etc. but for lounging or errands and light yoga they\\'re ideal. also an excellent price looks and feels great i love love love these pants.everything -the color, the fabric, the make is perfect.these are very comfortable.i love the belt.these pants are fit for anywhere e.g.  office, picnic, school, celebrations which makes them unique.i m 5\\'4&#34;  122 lbs and medium size is perfect for me.i m very impressed by the maker of these pants. always tough to buy clothes online, but these pants turned out to be great. very thick and soft, and have pockets as well. i love love love these yoga pants they fit perfect their not too tight or too loose and they make my butt look so firm and nice i am definitely going to purchase 2 more pair i already have them in my shopping cart.:-) these are nice, loose pants. several people said they ran really long, and since i\\'m tall, i was happy about that, but realized they weren\\'t really that long. i thought they were on the longer side of normal was all but definitely as long as a tall size would have been. i like them - kind of dressy but really comfy. these are great pants and made really well for the price but i advise sizing up love these scrubs!!! material feels great. fits like a glove! quite comparable to grey\\'s anatomy scrubs, but half the price. these are the only scrubs i\\'ll be wearing from now on! i.... i love these. when i opened them they like.... hugged my eyes when i looked at them. usually everything is too long for me because im under 5ft but theyre perfect length. and they have stayed soft after washes. these are so comfrontable. i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; a little longer but i wear a small heel and they are fine. soo comfy and sexy. i love the plazo pants!!! bought my size and they are very cute and fit good but they are really poofy on the sides (flares out alot) love these pants!  i never find pants that fit online!  they are awesome!  i will live in these pants! fits really cute. sewing a little sloppy.. quite a bit of loose threading. haven\\'t worn it out yet. have to see how it holds up. very comfortable and accurate sizing. love them!! cute and comfortable! ordered a large; fit\\'s ok but not as roomy as i expected.  my size is normally a 10.  the fabric is very nice and shipped on time as promised. the waist was loose should of gotten a medium. they look and feel good and keep my leg warm. there are to many lysse leggings and it was hard to choice and i order three different ones and two were wonderful. very comfy, very unique pants. i am not even pregnant and i ordered these pants because a friend of mine was wearing them one day and i loved how cute they were! even without a pregnant belly these pants fit and they are super comfortable! i love everything about them and i get compliments on them all the time. love them! they are really comfortable! great pant for the price. it is beautiful, as the picture shows.<br />made from linen. i am size 12, and 55 tall. i ordered 14 and runs like a mini dress, i need leggings for that. it is ok. i wore these for over 24 hours straight...held up great! they have a nice hold and stretch. perfect...now to see how they hold up in the wash i ordered these on impulse because they were flashed before my eyes as a big bargain for $10.00, while i was looking for something else, (they know me so well) anyway i ordered them and received a great pair of pants, i am so glad i decided to get them...the color is beautiful soft powder blue, very well made, and fit perfect,  i got a small.  they are made by godson, a great bargain at ten bucks.<br />i have washed them twice in cold water, dryer on delicate, they came out fine, i love them, also they don\\'t stretch out and look all baggy in the knees and behind either... i like the fit and feel of these jeans. and from past experience, i know they will last a long time had to hem, no length listed and my other pair i bought at a costco road show were perfect length. these fit perfect! true to size and very comfortable:-) worth the money!! the length is perfect for someone 5\\'4<br />will buy again!<br /><br />thank you<br />carolyn very cute, seems like one leg might be a little shorter than the other but it could be my imagination, but overall, very cute jumper!!!! i love this product! the leg is a little large but it`s a really good product. i loved it. feel fine with this product. quality is 100%. i purchased two pairs of these pants based on reading both positive and negative reviews here. i chose to order a size xl since i normally wear a medium. i am 5\\'3&#34;, and 130 lbs with a curvy figure. these pants were actually big on me, and i did request a refund. i am waiting to get the refund so i can go ahead and reorder a size l.<br /><br />pros:<br />-  these pants are cheap and so far, they were made decently. no buttons popped off, no seams came undone, and no pulled threads or holes.<br />-  they are comfortable. they have enough of a stretch to them to keep their shape through most moderate activity.<br />-  the colors run true. i ordered the coral and the teal, and both were colored evenly and brightly. i didn\\'t wash them though, so i don\\'t know how they hold up in the wash.<br /><br />cons:<br />-  these pants are comfy, but do not have the structure of jeans. denim can be stiff and uncomfortable, but it doesn\\'t show a topographical map of your skin, either. these pants are thick enough to not show undergarment outlines, but are still thin enough to show the wiggle and jiggle of your steps.<br /><br />-  the waistband of these pants is very loose. i prefer my pants with a loose waist, but these needed a belt to hold them up. this is the main reason i had to switch them out for a large. the length was wayyyy too long, but i was expecting that. :) shouldn\\'t be too hard to hem.<br /><br />-  this is a con specific to those of us with dress codes; i would -probably- not be able to wear these to my work. i am a public school teacher, and skinny jeans are one thing, the equivalent of jeggings are another. these are super comfy for running around the town, and i feel comfortable that i could meet parents and not look like a ragamuffin, but i don\\'t think my boss would approve of these for professional dress. maybe on our casual fridays or with a tunic.<br /><br />after all is said and done, the quality for the price is great, and the colors are cute. for &#34;play&#34; clothes, you can\\'t beat this deal! i would definitely order from them again. same rating as the purple pants, obviously i took a chance and won. great fit. i\\'m 5\\'9 and i bought a large. long enough to hit the floor. comfy enough to lounge in, nice enough to wear out with heels. only issue is the bottom came a little frayed. these pants are incredibly flattering, especially for those who have a bit of a belly. they are form fitting, comfy and little bit stretchy so i was able to work comfortable in them. i was surprised to see that there was no zipper or button but it worked out for me either way. super comfy and form fitting. not super thick material which is nice for working out in the summer. these are perfect! 2nd pair i\\'ve ordered, because i absolutely love these! i like my yoga pants long on me and that\\'s really hard to find, but these are perfect! i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; and they\\'ve definitely got a little length on me, but that\\'s how i like it! i just love it, very comfortable and i get compliments all the time. i\\'ve purchase many of the ninimour products of this type. dresses, skirts and leggings. they all wear nice, wash easily and are so soft and fun to wear. these are great! the material is a little thin but that\\'s good when it\\'s warm weather. loved  the fit. these pants are great for the price. these were great and true to size which i was surprized on.  i actually take a size 10 or 12, depending on the make so thought these would run small because they were cheap.  i was wrong and they were quite big on me but still worked because i wore a dress over them.  good buy. they are long, comfortable and fit very well. i can say i am very satisfied with this product from you. excellent i like it, i paid attention to the reviews from before saying that they are running on the small side, so i picked the 1x for myself. i normally wear a l or xl depending on the brand and the 1x fit just fine. it wasn\\'t baggy or too tight. only thing i\\'m not a fan of is how stiff the sides are with the lettering but maybe that might loosen up the more i wear it. comfortable flexible fabulous feel and great length which is so hard to find !  also  i plan to buy more if i see it advertised again! it is quality at an awesome price (which was so low ) that i feel i got a great deal! i absolutely love these they are by far my favorite pants i have thick thighs and was scared they would be see threw but the fabric is great. they\\'re stretchy and yes the print is not precise but i think they were made that way.<br />tip-turn inside out when washing so comfy! great for hot weather international travel. i love these paints.  they are a light material (so you can easily ware them out side on a hot day).  they are a touch long i am 5\\'5.  so if you are shorter than that i think you would have a problem with these. the material is nice but the sizing is off.  i usually take an x-large tall in all pull on pants and i ordered the large and they are very big on me.  they are very long waisted they hang at the crotch, i can pull them up to my bra with room.  the length was good, i\\'m 5\\'10&#34;<br />wish i had ordered medium these shorts are beautiful and very comfy. although the color is a little off from what i saw on the picture i still love it. it fits perfectly. i\\'m 5\\'2\\'\\' and usually fit the waist size 0 or 1. but these shorts are pretty stretchy that they can probably fit to anyone else\\'s size, reasonably. even comes with a cute belt these pants were delivered very quickly and are quite stylish. the only thing that seemed different than in the photo was that they are not as baggy, they fit like leggings. the material is fine, though it feels very synthetic. i will see how they feel after washing them. on the plus side, they make my booty look great! and they are very comfortable. love the color this is the second pair i ordered. love them!!! i would recommend only going one size up, not two. i am 5\\'4&#34;, 104 lbs., 25&#34; waist and i bought 27&#34; because all the reviews said to go two sizes up...now they are a bit baggier than i would like but &#34;thank goodness&#34; for the tie waist. i have been looking for cargo pants forever and was reluctant to buy these because of some of the reviews...i am glad i went for it. quality - a+++. i wouldn\\'t hesitate buying more.  shipped within\\' 5 days of ordering them. oh yea you\\'ll work up a major sweat.  just doing a simple stroll in the park i was drenched. i was pleasantly surprised by the fit of this 2 piece set. i really like it and hope to wear it a lot. i am very happy with this item.  i am of short stature, so had to re-hem them.  but very nice. this product is great because it is both comfortable and practical.i can go to sleep in them and answer the door without worry! i actually like these alot, made decent and lightweight, perfect for night wear in florida in april. i wore this with a drapey chiffon batwing top and a tank underneath with a fergie wedge sandal and received many compliments.  the only drawback is they run a little big but not to bad.  i would have liked them a little tighter for the leather affect.  i would say go one size down when ordering.  i am usually a medium bottom 10-12 us size, and i ordered a large, i am 5\\'2, longer legs than waist. i should have ordered the medium. i hope this helps the next buyer. pants are super comfortable and runs large. i bought these pants after reading their review. i did order a size smaller and they are very comfortable and roomy. after washing they did not shrink up and have held their color very well.<br />the only thing i have a problem with is the slider at the waist. it is somewhat better than the drawstring that i have in other elastic waist pants. the slider does cut into the material that runs through the waste band. other than that i find that these pants are perfect. cute, comfy and fast shipping. the only thing i didn\\'t like about it was i ordered xl in both an the purple came in lrg... i like my pjs to be big and comfy.. i ordered these pants and i do like them. the material is great and they are very light, just what i wanted, however the sizes are not accurate according to their seizing chart. the pants are a little tight so i say if you are considering these pants i would go a size larger than what you normally wear. i loved the  pattern and use them mainly for the gym but they are super comfy and fit as expected.  would order some more like this again for sure. comfy, soft, warm.. all the things i had wanted in lounging pants.  i would give it one more star if it were a bit thicker. i ordered 2 pairs, both size large. the gray pair is at least 1.5 inches longer than the black pair. both are very comfortable and flattering, but there is obvious variation in length. also, the black ones already have a small hole in the fabric after one wash. they are cheap, so i can\\'t complain too much, but it is buyer beware. these are extremely comfortable! i\\'ve worn and washed them a few times since purchasing and they have held up nicely. look forward to buying more! my wife was looking for these ag jeans and i was pleasantly surprised to have found a great deal on them at amazon.  she loves the fit and quality of this brand.  i admit they do look great on her. great charcoal pants.  perfect for yoga classes and just lounging around as well.  the fit is good and the price was great! exactly what i was looking for. i usually wear a size 0 or a waist of 26 so i ordered up a few sizes, a size 4/28 and they fit perfectly! i have the black pair and am e x t r e m e l y happy with them. i ordered the heather gray pair today! they have a hidden pocket on the right side, i believe (may be the left). too small to put a phone in, but it is nice. i don\\'t use it because i roll my waistband down but it is still nice. they don\\'t show sweat stains for me and are a great blend of fabrics. they aren\\'t super thin and cheap and they don\\'t stretch throughout the day to the point where they look baggy, which is great! over all these leggings are the best i\\'ve ever worn. i do not work out in them, but if i were to work out at all, i would wear these. i do yoga, but i wear harem pants for that anyway. i have bought other, cheaper leggings on amazon and they were basically hoes. they got runs within the first day and after that, lint balls formed after every wash, getting worse each time. these do not fade and they do not rip or create lint balls. the lettering on the tag fades slowly, but that isn\\'t an issue for me. best $20 i\\'ve ever spent. a little smaller than expected,  but very comfortable love it. fits perfect. got a small and im about 125llb 5 5\\'. expected the slit to be bigger but perfect overall. would definitely recommend. i actually wanted maternity yoga pants and cannot find any. i normally wear a size 6 pants prepregnancy and am 5\\'9&#34; tall. the length on these is great. i ordered a large and am shocked that they are a little tight. i still only weigh 147lbs at 13 weeks pregnant, but these are a little tighter in my legs and behind. i\\'m back to order another pair and may try the x-large. all around, i like them. bought these for my daughter as a christmas present. they took a couple of weeks to get here. she was thrilled with them. i think they were a good fit. beautiful pants, i got the purple and they are a great color and have a great feel to them. however, the large that i ordered could pass for a medium, even a small. whew! if you are going to buy them, you def need a size up. or two. also, they are not hemmed. it\\'s fine, but they look like someone took shears to the bottom. it\\'s not a clean looking cut. i like them but will return for a larger pair. the fit is nice and comfortable ! way nice they are comfortable. i\\'m getting another pair a size smaller. either i\\'ve lost weight or they run a little big. will find out soon. i bought these mainly to wear around the house for comfort and to sleep in and they work just fine. they are very comfortable and fit well. if you wanted to use them for yoga they would work wonderfully because they are very flexible. i hate sleeping in something that makes me sweat...these pants are perfect. i love these. they feel so good on me. they are soft and smooth. i was a little hesitant to order these as i was worried the size would be smaller than indicated online. but they fit perfectly. i will be ordering from this vendor again. very comfortable, love the color they are perfect for work..i\\'m not usually a fan of polyester, but i am getting sick of ironing.....now that i have had a chance to wear these a couple of times...they have a tendency to slide down. maybe i\\'ll get the next size smaller next time. perfect club wear. i purchased this item as a gift for a friend that loved the original designer version. she\\'s over the moon with this version, and it is a cheaper version. one small note-- item took a month to arrive to greece, so i can only imagine it would of taken longer to arrive to the us. also, after purchasing i did find it from other &#34;replica&#34; sellers at aliexpress for $10 usd and free shipping.<br /><br />overall seller was great about providing feedback and shipping info, so pleased with customer service and product. weak stitching, but otherwise awesome. a lot of other print leggings don\\'t stretch as much or have as high a waist, which winds up showing my butt if i bend over. these don\\'t. super comfy and they don\\'t feel like the seams will rip if i move around in them. i\\'m 5\\' and 140lbs, so i have bigger thighs, but these will fit anyone taller or skinnier and they still fit me great. amazing for the price - may still take them to my sewing machine and reinforce the seams though. cute and comfy but they are baggier than they appear online fits like it should, love the cushion! i\\'ve ordered similar items to this from other brands and they were ridiculously small, but i love this one! it\\'s so comfortable..just be careful of other brands..i wish i knew the names because they were so disappointing. takes awhile to ship, but my lady likes them enough she told me to take a second and give it a 5 star and a recommend to others.. you must order at least two sizes smaller than you usually wear, i am a size 18 usually, and i ordered the large (which was nice in its self, its been a long time since i have had a size large on a pants label and they fit!! lol) i have not had any issues with them shrinking at all, but i do not use a dryer, i line dry them, so maybe that\\'s why... they are thin, but not so thin that you can see threw them at all, very comfortable!!! i have ordered more, for fear that they may run out of them. just remember to look at their size chart and go from there! i don\\'t think you will be disappointed! i can’t believe that i was able to find these jeans. i normally have to spend around $50+ to buy the perfect pair of jeans that i want. finding touch me is the best thing that has happened to my life. i saved so much money and found so many clothing’s that fit me! wool is not very comfortable love love love loveeeee and it has pockets definitely purchasing moree i love these pants! when i got them i was sure they were too small but once i got them on they fit perfectly. i am a bit petite so these come a bit longer for me but not so long that i can\\'t just scrunch them up a bit. they are super comfortable and true to size. planning on getting all the colors! loved them so cute and worth it!! great fit. comfy. a little thin but that makes em okay to wear in warmer weather i read the other reviews and ordered a large when i should have ordered a medium. they still fit very nice and do the job they were made for. nice product! what a great price for a nice pair of women\\'s lounge pants. the washed/dryed nicely without too much shrinkage. love them!! sized and fits as expected, i love these baggy harem pants!! so comfortable!! i very good buy i highly recommend!!! 5 stars!! had doubts but really turnedout to love these. the fit is perfect arrived quickly.  no complaints from my daughter i purchased this for my wife... she absolutely loved it so much that i had to make another purchase of this product. i like them. not the original fit, which is my favorite, but they fit well and look nice. super cute :) just checked the mailbox and was overjoyed to see my greenapple pants where here. i own many things made by them . never have a complaints about them . they feel so good on . these are cute, comfortable and fit me perfectly. as other reviewers mentioned, material is thin/bit see through in white. i just wear a long top with it works fine. runs small they fit the girls well and are soft<br />the girls range in size but fit all<br />we didnt get the last two when promised tho they are so comfortable you hardly know their on.  i must have 6 pair by now in different patterns.  i wear them casual, or dress them up with a dressy blouse and jewelry, and shoes with a slight heel.  can\\'t say enough good things about these pant except that they are awesome. these pants are so comfortable, fits well too.  i like that the waistband is flat, not gathered.  hope these last a long time cause i will be wearing a lot! these are great. i\\'m a shortie (5\\' 2&#34;) and these fall right at my ankles - i ordered a medium.  they are stretchy enough in the waist, and they don\\'t look or feel like old lady pants (i\\'m 26 and try to look professional at work, while trying to be somwhat fashionable.) fit as expected, really comfortable i love these cargo pants.  they are a really cute fit, but just keep in mind they run really small. i am a size 5-6 normally in jeans, but in these an 8 fit just right, so be sure to order up in size. i love it♡ these pants are well made and fit nicely. i ordered a second pair. they did loose some length in the wash, even when washed on cold. i was so happy to get these in the mail. i wore them the day i got them to warped tour and they fit perfectly, and are very cooling without riding up. i wear them all the time now! super cute. i own these pants in a different color and loved them, so i was excited to see this color on sale. these are made of a different fabric, which i didn\\'t expect, but they will do. great wonderfully fitting pants! crisp clean and so comfy with just the right amount of stretch. fabric is versatile, perfect for dressing up or down. delivery was speedy. will be ordering these pants in severa other colors! they are really long. i`m 5`2 didn\\'t feel like hemming so i gave them to my daughter. fits great i love the bow cut outs on the side and i recommend this pants to anyone!!! great fit very comfortable, easy to launder; like the musical motif; and the tie waist and the length of the leg etc these are very nice looking and comfortable. not as waterproof as i would like. after  sitting on a ski lift that has snow on it 4 times i started to feel slight wetness. overall good quality though. i love them. beautiful color, washes well, perfect for me in small/tall ( 5\\'10&#34;/ 132 lbs). these look professional to wear with polo or nice t-shirt at my occupational therapy job. i love these. super cute for the price. i am 5\\'8&#34;, 118 lbs and i got the small....they fit just right...a tad loose in the hips but nothing extreme. cute to dress up or down. i bought these pants to wear to work.  they are comfortable and roomy. light weight an versatile.  great for every day and give the option of pants or caprice.  love them, will be ordering more and in different colors. i really like these.  i just wish there was a little more cotton in them. ordered a second pair. love them. if pants fit me in the waist they are too big in the legs, and visa versa.  and often are too short.  for a hard to fit person, these fit very well, a little long (but i don\\'t mind).  i love the stretch.  they seem to wash up well.  i ordered this one and then ordered 4 more different colors.  i would buy again. so beautiful. confortable my 13 year old loved this ! she is about 5&#34;1 and its great. they are warm fit well color is ok but i will enjoy them durning the cold winter. they really make me sweat during my workouts!! they look nice, basic quality. saw a few loose threads on it last night. still a unique pattern my wife digs. it matches any of her kitty stuff. this is perfect if you don\\'t want expend to much money. it fit good, i got it on time and i love it! i loved it these are made of lightweight, pretty material.  the only thing is, i am 5\\'5&#34;, and these do not even go to my ankles. and there is no freaking way this would ever turn into a &#34;jumpsuit&#34;. but i only intend to wear them as pants, so i\\'m pretty happy with these. i\\'ll have to be careful when i wash them so they don\\'t shrink, but they\\'re really cute. somewhat thinner material than what i was expecting. fits perfect. i just love it!!!!!! very nice plan to purchase one more outfit i love these pants and have several pairs.  i really like that i do not have to iron them, they come straight out of the dryer ready to wear.  they are also very soft and comfortable. love this product. bought xl but think large would have been a better fit. this is an awesome pair of leggings!  i bought the one with the cutout panels on the sides of the legs, with ruffles all down the hips.  it fits great, and looks killer!  i will definitely continue buying items from this seller! l really like them  a lot good quality i bought these pants in xl as a gift to a young adult who can wear a junior size 13 and 15 and these pants were perfect. not too tight but not too loose. they do ride the hip too so if you have junk in the trunk you may need a belt or a shirt to cover certain back views (wink) i will order from this seller again though. the items were exactly as pictured and described. order was fast and on time! it was great except for the fact that it wasn\\'t long enough for my legs by a couple inches, if you can send me another one it would be much appreciated. thank you. i\\'m usually a medium, bought an xl and they fit perfect! great pants, wish they had them in other colors. fits perfectly. looks so sophisticated. great pants. i ordered a medium and large because of the other comments on size. i\\'m normally a 4, the large fit best. if you are anywhere near an 8 or 10 these pants may not work out :( i read that they run big but i found them to be a little too tight for my big ass. still, i put them on because if they really work i should fit into them soon. the package said it contained the pants and a slimming belt but there was no belt included. on the upside, my body is moist when i take them off so i think i might be sweating some weight away. people need to remember though, you can\\'t eat like a hog just because you\\'re wearing these. you aren\\'t really losing fat, just water... so drink plenty of fluids to avoid becoming de-hydrated! great i was skeptical about ordering these jeans because it had been a few years since i tried a pair on at the department store and couldn\\'t tell which size to get now.  i went there (dept store) again recently to find out they didn\\'t sell them anymore because people didn\\'t buy them.  i know why...because although they look good they are very expensive.  i fell in love with them 2 years ago but paying retail price for jeans was out of my budget especially since they never were on sale.      i just so happened to have a 20 off clothing coupon with amazon.com and went on a limb and typed in nydj and i found them on sale!!!! i bought 2 pair at size 14 but could have bought a 12 in these.  i was used to trying on the nydj with the 96% cotton and 4% spandex.  these had the polyester blend, thus my skepticism. i was not disappointed.  i loved these more so because of the extra give in the waist making me have no muffin top.  feels good, love the higher rise and not constrictive at all.  plus i look great!!!! came on time. cute, well made, good size. a little thick. but i guess on the cold days that will be welcomed. i am not sure if they will wear out a lttle with washing. ok fits great thes are the most comfortable pants in the world! i love them. they are very thin so if i wore underwear the lines would most definitely show, so i don\\'t. they come unhemed so you can adjust the length which is nice because i\\'m only 5 feet. i ordered a lg and weigh about 150, so i\\'m not tiny, but i\\'m not big either. they flatter your curves very well. i\\'m ordering a ton in different colors! i just received them and tried them one...they look great and it feels like i\\'m wearing pj\\'s.....so comfy! paired with a blouse/jacket i will be able to wear these to the office. really like this pants!!! will buy more in the future!! i\\'m working on my chunkiness so even the xl is more tights then yoga like.  but the quality and coolness of it cannot be beat. love, love,love these pj bottoms. they are the first thing i run to when i get home from work. pair \\'em with a &#34;life is good&#34; t-shirt and a pair of comfy oversized socks. you\\'re ready for an evening of relaxation with your favorite pup! i read everyone\\'s feedback and since i buy lots of clothes from china i figured i had it worked out. i got an xl. i am a size 6 and a large would have been the way to go. i made a co-worker very happy though! the shipping was pretty fast considering and the pants were great. if you can get the right size you will love them! grey\\'s anatomy scrubs are my favorite scrubs! they are very soft, don\\'t shrink and the sizing is accurate. i would definitely recommend them fits as expected and lovely color! material is thin so i wear it as lounge pants mostly, but otherwise good buy! love it i love the way these pants fit!  they are very flattering.  only down side to these is they are hand wash only. i\\'m 5\\'4/165 and i got the large...it\\'s fitted around the but and hips and flows around the legs. luv the look...got so many compliments, i ordered every color. i bought an exact replica of these under the brand name &#34;g by guess&#34; and i paid a lot more.    these run large as warned by so many here, so if you\\'re a medium, you order a large.  ended up perfect size.  if you were to order the g by guess linen pants you\\'d order medium.  order these and you have to order large. material is very lightweight. i want to order more. but there out of my size. i ordered down a few sizes. caz there stretch jeans. love them, was hoping to wear for yoga and i do! they move, look, and feel great. looks like i will have to reinforce crotch seams soon, but for the price 5 stars! ordered a pair of starry nights from another seller and still waiting on delivery for weeks:/ still can\\'t wait for them i hope for same fit and material! excelen thanks all palazzo pants are made of very thin material and are made very long.  i personally am building a collection of them.  i go get them hemmed for  $10 everytime i get a new pair. love them super comfortable and look great! these are my favorite maternity bottoms by far. the sizing seemed good for x-large, the fabric is very soft. they seem well made and the person i gave them too likes them alot and is wearing them everynight now since the holidays. they have been through the wash a couple of times now and the colors have not faded and the fabric is not pilling. we are happy with the purchase. i love them. fits nice.  smooth texture. fits good they are so comfortable and just the right length, they also shipped and arrived quickly. i plan to get another pair! cute n cheap met all expectations. after reading some of the reviews saying this item runs small, i decided on ordering a medium.  i usually wear a small.  glad i did.....the medium fits perfectly.  they are really cute! cant wait to wear them.  it did take over a month to receive them because they came from china so that\\'s why i rated it 4 stars instead of 5.  hope this helps. very comfortable and wash well. i have ordered the size smaller to see if i like that tummy fit better (i prefer more snug fit on pull up pants) but they retain their shape well after a few wearings, wash and iron well. a little thin i don\\'t usually blow off doing reviews on amazon but these pants are so rad i had to let everyone know!! this review will probably be most helpful to those familiar with american apparel disco pants. i read some reviews that said these run small, but later reviews said to get whatever size you get with aa and i\\'m glad i did. these pants fit tight, and i mean tightttt. but they are supposed to. they squeeze everything in and smooth everything out. i wear a small in aa and i got a small in these. i am 5\\'1 and weigh 130 and i wear a size 4/6. the first time you put these pants on it was a little bit of a struggle but once i got them on the first time it\\'s been easier every time. i\\'m glad the zipper is a little bit more industrial because it seems to stand up better to the tight pull of the fabric. i would say the quality falls between aa and the shiny leggings i\\'ve gotten. long story short is these pants are worth every dollar and if you\\'re looking for an aa alternative these are as close as i\\'ve found without dropping $85 for the real deal, and believe me, i\\'ve tried them all. good luck!! love these lounge pants! they are a beautiful cranberry color and they are my favorite of all my lounge pants. they wash and wear well<br />without shrinkage. i\\'m hoping to get the gorgeous purple one when they come back in stock. they are crazy bright, but the material is so nice (very soft)! love love love...i live in these there are super cute, really comfortable, stretchy and soft. the pinstripe is thick enough where it isn\\'t too busy and difficult on the eyes. it arrived quicker than expected. i love clothing from la base! anyways they where very light stretchy comfy and they make your legs seem slimmer. wish i bought a couple more of these quite pleased with these pants!  they are incredibly comfortable and exactly what i was looking for.  they are quite long, so you may need to hem them a bit.  the only complaint i have is i wish the material was just a tad bit thicker.  i am not sure how long they will last, but i will enjoy wearing them while they do! use them all the time still wear these had for some time, love everything about them. yes they run a little long but that is perfectly fine i bought several colors...they are very soft and comfortable. love how they come up to the waist. not too low awesome love them!! i enjoy these pants they have room and they feel so good on my legs! matter of fact i am wearing them now!<br /><br />so excited! leggings look just like the pic. my daughter loved them! love them.  great long length and fit, nice look, comfortable, not too heavy material. great product for the price, but runs very small (let\\'s just say i usually wear a size small and the large fits perfectly, interestingly!) i look better than i expect with this ones 👍👍👍 great customer service. love these pants! these fit as expected.  they\\'re just as comfortable as regular tights, leggings, jeggings, etc.  i kinda like them because they hold your lower belly in some. not exactly the fit i expected.  seems to be a bit snug.  however i love them.  and the fact that they have pockets is a wonderful plus.  thinking about getting another pair. love these. they fit great. works to dress up a bit or for a casual day. very comfortable as well. love these!<br />they fit great and are extremely comefortable! definitely recommend! nice fabric, nice style, great quality. these look great on my wife and she is loving them. as with all asian products, follow the sizing chart. fits perfect but is see through. my favourite pants, hands down. excellent for clinics. beautiful color, very comfortable pretty color!! great price for these very nice linen pants. comfortable fit, very versatile. be warned, though, they do wrinkle very easily. these pants run small. but they are made of a very good material. i was unable to wear them because of the sizing issue but customer service was excellent and they helped solve my issue. item arrived on time. just the size, it fits somewhat small. it look alright. love them! cute color! i\\'m 5\\'2 about 110 and scrubs are known to run big so i ordered the xs. they fit perfect and are even a little tight around the waist. i am swimming in most size small scrubs but i think i could\\'ve fit a small in this brand too. i would wear theses everyday if i could. the material is nice on these, and the dark green color wasnt sheer or anything, they were too short though and i gave them to my younger brother very comfy, but really long. beautiful color and fits small, petite size woman. i like the pants but they do run short. even for me at 5\\'1&#34; great fit looks fantastic never can buy pants without trying them on but i could not find a pair in navy so took a chance.  they are wonderful fabric (it feels like wearing nothing).  they drape beautifully.  i just love them and will probably buy another pair. i am shy to order clothing and shoes online, but these pants are so worth buying! they fit very well, are very comfortable, look great! i signed in to amazon to buy another pair. wonderful pants i now wear them to work and pretend they\\'re dress pants. nobody can tell the difference, i\\'m comfortable, and my butt looks great! highly recommended! these are constructed to a very high standard, fit well and exceed my expectations.  a quality product with great style. 😍😍 i am 5\\'5 and the length is perfect. purchased this for postpartum (9 mos preggo right now) and the band stretches enough to fit my waist! i know for sure i will be wearing this after pregnancy because my hips and butt did not gain any weight. i was 118 pre pregnancy and purchased a size small. well worth the price! this purchase was for my daughter , she absolutely loves the color and quality .go my little yoga girl, she also likes to wear them just to relax with friends .they are great for spring , summer picnics , concerts , she will be wearing more than one pair . delivery time was adequate , i recommend to al yoga enthusiast and casual dressers 5\\'4&#34; and i wear pant size 7 or 9, depending on the brand and cut. i do have junk in the trunk so i ordered a large. it fit perfectly! not too big not too small. please keep in mind  both your height and size! get out that measuring tape and make sure that they will fit on you. great pair of shorts, especially for the price. but a little long,  but so cute. rerturned absolutely love these scrubs! they fit nicely without looking saggy/baggy and have plenty of pockets!! very cute pants but i cannot wear them out in public because they are too transparent. i love to wear them around the house with long shirts that cover my booty. i am 5\\'7\\'\\' and i love how long they are, they cover my feet when i am standing up. i would like to order them in another color so i can feel comfortable wearing them out. love these pants!  to be honest i was hesitant to try these because of the bell bottoms, however i\\'m so glad that i did! these pants are so comfort and soft!  i really like the way that they feel on my skin.  the seams have quality stitching and they are made of quality material.  i\\'m about 5&#34;4 140 pounds, i ordered medium.  they fit snug but are stretchy so they\\'re very comfortable.  the length is a little long for me but some heeled boots and made a little hemming will make them perfect!  i like them so much i\\'m considering ordering a couple pairs as gifts!  i\\'m very happy with these pants.  i was able to receive this product during a promotional period in exchange for my unbiased review. very, very comfortable.  ordered additional pairs after trying.  retains fit after laundering (i use cold water and woolite). it was a little small but over all i do like it. my daughter really likes these and they fit very nice on her. she wears them with leggings under them. super cute. perfect fit.  fast shipping these are so comfortable to wear. heavyweight (a good heavy weight) material that drapes in a flattering manner. fabric is luscious. i love these harlem pants!  they are so smooth and comfortable to wear! i got them because i was sick of plain old yoga pants to wear around the house. the waist is super comfy and they fit amazing rather they are tighter fighting or looser fitting. my neices happened to see me in them and asked where i got them. their words were &#34;i would wear the crap outta those pants&#34; i also absolutely love that they don\\'t stretch out and leave you with a saggy bum.  i received these at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. material is stretchy and fits perfect to the curves of your body. nice purchase for low price. i like most of the items in the bundle, a few i definitely did not like; but that\\'s to be expected. these bundles are great for risk-takers who aren\\'t afraid to mix up their style :) super comfy! recommend washing twice before first wear. love the print, very comfy. sizing off a bit. i would go up one size on what one usually wears. but love the price! these are not slouchy, gaucho type pants. they are more fitted, but very comfortable.<br />yes they are made by forever 21+ and have that label on the inside.<br />my only negative would be that they are a liiiiitle short. i am 5\\' 8ish and they ride up just a bit after walking making the pants come an inch or two above my ankles. i was looking to replace a similar pair of lounge pants that i wear around the house that was worn out. these seemed to fit the bill - a bit pricey, but people rave about them, so i bought a pair. they\\'re very comfortable and i\\'m overall pleased, but the color palette in the pictures understates the color quite a bit. the egyptian emerald green color i chose is not subtle - very bright. great fit! shipping was super fast arrived fast... pants are a good fit! i love this pants, nice fit and very very comfortable . i has a little scared to order pants online because you don\\'t have the opportunity to try them on like at the clothing store. but i am very please with this pants. i will definitely order different colors. i ordered a larger size and they fit perfect. most comfortable pants ever! nice material.  drapes well.  fit is narrower and longer than previous pants from hatley. as good as others i have purchased. i read reviews that said these run small so i purchased the x-large (one size larger than i normally wear). i would have been better off with the large. they are too wide in the leg for me and it looks awkward. love it!  great fit, got the boots to go with if!  fast shipping!  thanks! excellent they run a bit small  but they do fit. can\\'t wait to  wear them for conquer the gauntlet  run! love it they good for to sleep in got the winter fleece lined legging, it\\'s very comfy and warm! i\\'m like 5\\'3 and this fits well. i think someone a little taller would fit well in it too, cause it\\'s a little sluggish on the bottom. but the only problem is it smells a little weird. but i bet washing it would fix it. love it loved it!!about to purchase all the colors. i am an loyal customer and will continue to get things from you. everything i have ordered have been great this are really nice pants bought them for my daughter she loves them wishes i bought her two the definately give the butt a nice look i had to order these pants three times to get a size that i could even go over my leg.  i\\'m normally a size 3, and these size 7 pants are still a bit snug.  however, the color is exactly what i was looking for. my niece loves them! very comfortable it is amazingly flattering, great fit, band color as expected. great pants. like new and really beautiful. arrived quickly. i adore this item.  it\\'s just what i hoped it would be and then so much more.  the price was extremely reasonable.  it arrived earlier than the projected date.  it\\'s warm, but not bulky, which is an added bonus.  i would purchase from this seller and brand name again in the future! these pants are light and flowy. they fit my hips well,but they\\'re long. i like them that way but others who are 5\\'3 or shorter may find them too long. my daughter complains about all of her clothes...she loves these!! will be ordering more :) i was never confident with slim fit jeans, because i didn\\'t know if my legs were that attractive. i always prefered dresses but after owning this, my love was directed to jeans like this. this one is the special one! like the quality!!! so cute, but zipper broken on delivery. i love my star wars jegggings will order more. i love these scrubs, but it\\'s funny...i bought the same size scrubs in a different shade (brown), and they seem larger than the black. these (after washing) seem to fit more like mediums. i bought these leggings in one size, they are very beautiful in person too but they run a bit large, i\\'m 5.6, 127 pounds and they are not form fitting, i had to change the waist band at my local tailors (i usually like my leggings with wide waist band) and they are ok at the waist now but still would like them to be a bit tighter on the thighs and legs. so very comfy! i love these! these are my 3rd pair! i did order the regular drawstring waist and did not like those as well as the smocked waist one. best ever terrific manufacture of quality clothing. i was skeptical, but these work. shipping was fast love these.  a little larger than i expected (i am usually a petite small but the xsmall fit best, perhaps even a little too big. this is a really great romper and made with great quality. it\\'s super bright and not as short as shown which is good! the zipper is very nice in the back. could have gotten a size smaller. comfortable i really like these pants. my only concern is they look a little sheer when outside. i bought 4 sets.  love the color and material is very comfortable. two pairs of pants the front seam sheared the first time i wore them.  the pants run small but the top is almost too big.  yet over all i really find then comfortable to wear.  i have washed them and hung up to dry with great results.  i like them better then the ones that are sold by a vendor where i work and the price is fantastic. its a good quality fabric, for the price. so comfortable and warm for winter goes with anything almost i love them! perfect fit they make a cute outfit to go out with friend or a fancy dinner so ok. i debated awarding this 4 stars but since any dissatisfaction i have is due to my own stupidity, i left it at 5.<br /><br />as usual, these pants are amazing. but being dumb, i ordered mine in a medium (after reading a review where a woman said her typical size was too small in the rear) my other lysse jeggings (boot cut) are in a small and they were much more suitable.<br /><br />even though these are on the large side (again, my fault) they are awesome and embody the sweet fit i have come to expect from the company. since i firmly believe i can\\'t have too many lysse leggings, i plan to order another pair of these in the smaller size. the fit is good and the comfort is great. very comfortable love it! i would buy more. very comfortable. love how long they are on me although i\\'m average height. material is thin but not see through. perfect for lounging i like the wide leg cut on these pants. my calves are pretty big and so these leggings do not squeeze them. i have plenty of room in them. love them, fit perfectly, look great these pants are absolutely what i wanted!!  i ❤️ them!! i love these pants, they fit perfectly and look so good. the shipping was really fast. love the fit and they wash well love the style. very comfortable. you can dress down or up with these pants. i got the mesh detail metallic leggings. and i love them. i am a little thicker so i like that they are not crazy tight but super form fitting, breathe, and the pattern is so so cute! i\\'m gonna kick ass in these. thanks maybe i\\'m not familiar with shapewear, but i found these to run small and it took some shimmying to get them over my hips.  i have a 27&#34; waist/37 1/2&#34; hips, and by the lysse size chart (not the one on amazon), i ordered a small:<br />lyss&eacute; leggings size  s  m  l  xl<br />women\\'s size  4-6  8-10  12-14  16-18<br />waist (inches)  25-28&#34;  28-31&#34;  31-34&#34;  33-36&#34;<br />hips  35-38&#34;  38-41&#34;  41-44&#34;  43-46&#34;<br />the small was very tight and hard to get on, so i returned it and ordered a medium.  it was not much different!  but just enough that it will work.  once on, they are very comfortable & look nice enough for work - which is what i wanted.  the inseam (not listed that i could find) measures 32&#34; which is ok if i wear heels but w/ flats, they drag on the ground (i am 5\\'8&#34;).  overall i do like them, but you may want to size up if you don\\'t want them super tight. love these!! super comfy & perfect for the office-  and yes, the other reviews are accurate, they run small - order size bigger than you normally wear. the pants are really gorgeous and very comfortable! i am obsessed with this pair of pants!!!! they are the perfect pants for every occasion.  you can dress the pants up for a fun night out or you can simply throw them on for running errands while looking chic!  i love these pants because they are so comfortable.  these pants are an awesome combination of comfort and style.  i will definitely be ordering more of these pants!!!! i bought these mistakenly thinking they were capris.  i see that they are called &#34;pants&#34; in the description, but the picture shows them as short and squat and i assumed (since they had come up in my search for capris) that i was buying what i saw.  i was wrong.  i considered whether to send them back, but then i tried them on and found them quite comfy.  i may shorten them to capri length, or i may keep them as is.  they are quite comfortable, even if they aren\\'t what i was expecting. the fit was just what i wanted. i didn\\'t want to much of a baggy look, but it fitted with a slight bit of barroom around the butt area which i wanted cause i have a big one back there . great pants  will order more. got these for my wife. they fit her great. i mean really great. whoever invented yoga pants is a saint. this product are of my mom and the fit is perfectly for her, i am very happy and is very very nice these pants are nice quality & look exactly as pictured. after reading the reviews i ordered 2 sizes up & they fit great. i\\'m 5ft and 113lbs, i usually wear a us2 but i got a 6 & they fit great! they are a little long bc i\\'m a shorty but i can cuff them under & it\\'s not noticable at all. i like them! i\\'m 5\\'3 and 130 lbs - i ordered both colors in small and they are perfect. after wearing a little and sitting down in them etc they stretch. the fabric is light and awesome. good experience. i\\'m feeling good in it. hold me tight as i like. thank you these pants are great. i\\'ve seen a lot of mixed reviews on fit but i\\'m 5\\'3 and 140 pounds and the mediums fit perfectly. they are a bit long but with my height most pants are. just simple hemming fixes the issue of length. i normally wear a size 25 in pants.  i ordered the 26 and they fit perfectly.  i am 5\\'6&#34; and 110 pounds. my waist is a 26 and my hips are a 32. these jeans are well made and warm. they are soft and cozy.  i washed them before wearing and they washed well.  cold water wash and low heat dryer for about 15 minutes, then air dry.  i wore them this past weekend in 18 degree temperature and they were fantastic! yeah the string does come out but if you still purchase them here\\'s a tip, take a safety pin and stick it through the end of the string and close it then push the safety pin and the string back into the hole slowly pinching prices of fabric together until you slide the string all the way back through.  in the future to prevent the string from coming back out just tie it together like you would when your wearing them then throw it in the wash. ;) love grey\\'s scrubs! the pants were slightly larger around the waist than the pair that i already have but i\\'m thinking a wash in hot water will do the trick. i received this as a gift, and was very pleased with the cut, quality, and feel of the fabric. i liked how the top and bottom coordinated, but could also be worn with other pieces of clothing. the leggings are tight-fitting, which i like. i\\'m now looking for a set with shorts instead of full-length pants. i was very happy with your products and very pleased with the customer service i received when i needed an exchange. i will continue to shop mystic clothing and i will recommend my friends to do the same. i love them. i bought these as a transitioin from my maternity pants, so it was great that the waist line was higher. only reason i\\'m giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that the legs were super long, so i had to have them shortened. other than that, i love these. love these pants!  great fit & just cut them with scissors to the correct length.  get tons of complements on them. sexiest pants i\\'ve ever bought. buy these pants! you i\\'ll not regret it. i\\'m 5\\'9&#34;, 258, wear a 22, bought these in a 20 based on reviews and they are perfect. need a belt to keep them secure due to the stretchy material, bit omg, i feel so sexy in these and my hubby agrees!!! i love these!  they are stretchy enough for total comfort and nice enough to wear to work (teacher)!  washed nicely and true to size i am a 6 and got a small (size 4-6).  highly recommend these! fast shipping too :) these are great looking and great fitting pants.  they are very stylish and the perfect color blue. what a great find. the fabric is thinner than expected but it\\'s very comfy and indeed slimming. i would recommend this to my friends. nice cargo pahts.  on the lighter side for the quality of material, but luv that they come in xl petite sixe &  don\\'t have to hem them. for the price- these were fantastic!! definitely recommend. love this! the material is a lot different from what i had expected it to be. but it\\'s fine, very comfortable and so cute. i can\\'t wait to wear it! i thought these jeans were really comfy and great looking.  i\\'m 5\\'10\\\\\\\\\" and they are a perfect length for me.  i love that they come up to my waist and hug, but don\\'t dig in (i don\\'t have a very small waist! ie:  differential between hip and waist is not great).<br />one thing i would mention because this is important to me, and that is that the main front pockets are a little shallow.  not too bad, but on the shallow side.  reason why i care is that i always carry my phone in those pockets and i do not want to be at risk of losing it, so i like it when the phone can go right down into the pocket and not stick out when i sit down.  so with these jeans, when i sit down, my iphone does not stick out, but sort of sits at belly-level *grin* - this is ok.<br /><br />overall - love them and would buy again. i\\'m 6\\' and normally wear a 22-24 size. these might have fit if i was 5-6 inches shorts. i couldn\\'t get them above my thighs. however, they seem very well made and comfy. these fleece lining would keep you warm and they\\'re thick enough that you could wear them without worrying about someone being able to see through them. these are so very comfortable. i love them. they fit perfectly. they are a little thin but not see through. i absolutely love these pants!  they are light and flowing yet thick enough that they\\'re not revealing.  they\\'re exactly what i wanted.  i would say hang dry them if you don\\'t want to iron then they stay perfect!  i\\'ve gone back and placed 2 more orders since my first purchase.  very pleased :) nice pants but they are big. i wear a 10-12 so i got the medium based on the size chart. i can pull pants on and off without having to unzip them. overall i really like them. great fit true to size in the waist the jeans fit as i expected them too, but in the lower leg they fit just a tad too small with not enough stretch to them. great fit.  comfy pants.  i ended up purchasing several pairs.  these are great for dressing up or down.  the linen material is perfect to help stay cool.  plus, pull it out of the dryer right away and you don\\'t have to worry about ironing! love grey\\'s. from dryer to hanger, no ironing ever. fits to size. like the extra deeper pockets then other grey\\'s and the cargo pocket is a plus! the color has a tiny hint of brown but goes well with the aqua jacket i had to pair it with. next time i will check colors in store, then order online. otherwise i am very pleased. i needed white linen pants for a south american cruise.  turns out i wore them a lot because it was so hot and i didn\\'t want to walk around all the time in shorts.  they wash well on a gentle setting with cold water. love these. perfect fit and length i wear these pants but wonder about their long term wearabilaty.  will the fabric last well. beautiful! love the color and fit nice quality, love amazon i bought two of these pants.  the first one was too big so bought another one.  the pant fits well once i go over the sizing and was able to get the correct size.  but the material advertised is in accurate is a bit thin. bought as christmas gift for my daughter who said it fit her perfectly a comfortable linen pant - top folds over like a yoga pant legs are linen; i\\'m taking to paris next month love them i am bout 5\\'10 and 215lbs, these pants fit amazingly...i will be ordering more colors :) they are a little long but other than that they are awsome!!!! i have been looking for some good summer pants for a long time. these are perfect fit and the material is great...these are gonna be great summer pants i brought these for my wife and it fits better than i expected.<br />i\\'m also buying another pair in black. love them! recieved the item in 2 days. (with amazon prime)<br /><br />5\\'2, 170lbs, 38c, and 7 1/2mos pregnant. got a medium.<br /><br />i will say that i can pull it off with my pregnancy right now, but the belly area is snug. (obviously) my intention wasn\\'t to wear it during pregnancy though.<br /><br />i always have a hard time finding a comfortable and flattering romper with my body type. im short and average size (without baby belly). i\\'d like to think i have a decent booty and i proudly have &#34;thunder thighs&#34; and mean calves.<br /><br />this romper will fit perfectly post pregnancy for sure, but fits me now just as well. i\\'m not too keen on the belt wraps and might consider removing them. i feel like a cute belt would look much better.<br /><br />overall i am satusfied with this purchase. super happy with these trousers. i was excited to get them and even more so at the fit and length. love the flow and silky hand. i bought these pants in the \\\\\\\\\"liscense plate\\\\\\\\\" design a few weeks ago. i am a bigger girl so i went with an xl because, although i do not usually wear an xl, i had a suspicion that the pants might end up running on the small side. my pair came and it turns out they *are* a little on the small side. i wish they were longer too as i am 5\\'8\\\\\\\\\" and the pants would be great if they were a few inches longer.<br /><br />that said, these pants are super soft and fun to wear. i\\'ve slept in them and worn them while running around the house, and i really do love them despite the few things mentioned above. i\\'d definitely recommend these cute suckers to anyone looking for a really soft, comfortable lounge pant for a very reasonable price. i\\'m considering a second pair myself. i love these pants!  i wear them casually, but it is dressy-looking enough that i can still wear it in my business.  it is supper comfortable, and, being 5\\'4&#34;, i thought it would be dragging all over the streets of ny, but it fits perfectly because you fold the waist top down and lift the pants up. i got a whole bunch of these. practical these are awesome! best for summer - the material is thin (but soft) and the fabric splits /drapes from the thigh. wash with delicates. silky, comfortable, great to grow into when i was pregnant i\\'m 5\\'3&#34;, curvy, and have thighs that touch! these are great. they have a long drawstring which could be shortened. received many compliments on them. sleek style compared to koi lindsey style which is more casual. like them very much. material not as silky as i thought tephey would but that\\'s on me as i didn\\'t fully read the description. would recommend them i love these!<br />i was afraid they wouldn\\'t look good or fit well but they\\'re perfect.<br />i\\'m 164cm and wear xs/s and it fits perfectly so i wouldn\\'t recommend for bigger sizes/taller people though.<br />bad thing is that they\\'re so thin you can\\'t wear them on their own, because people would see your underwear lol. as comfy as reviews stated! i love these pants. i recently ordered 2 more. they are very comfortable and light weight. i wish they had pockets then they\\'d be perfect. i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; tall and they are plenty long for me. love these.  they are comfy for home yet can be dressed up to wear to work or the evenings.  thanks. i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; tall weigh 125lbs.  the yoga pants fit perfectly. just an inch too long. love the fabric. just the right combo nice great fit, comfortable and perfect for long-haul flights with changes in weather.<br /><br />this is my second purchase and i suspect not my last. [[videoid:30cc6c3dde10910109ddbb86222c1b9f]]i absolutely love the wide leg yoga pants. i wish i had a pair for each day of the week.  they are extremely soft and so comfortable that i would rather wear these than anything else in my wardrobe.  they are high quality and durably made and pair up with just about any top.  they are made of 95% rayon and 5% spandex which makes for a great fit and free movement.  these can be worn for workouts or as a casual pair of everyday wear.  i received these great pants in exchange for evaluation and an honest review and i love them.  this is a great gift idea for all your on the go friends. good!! great pants!  i love them. love them! my sissy loves these & she says there so soft & comfortable,she is very satisfied with them these pants are so comfortable,...i liked my first 2 pairs so much i got another 3 pairs in different colors! they are the best lounge pants ever,...and the pockets are key in making them more functional than the usual lounge pants. customer service is also fantastic,...great communication when i was looking for more colors! material is a bit flimsy update: washed and dried and the set came out perfect! still soft and comfortable. i made a slight alteration where the back tapers, i tapered it a bit more to give it a more hour glass shape since i don\\'t have much curves, the fix gives me illusion of more shape. would be totally unnecessary for others. i would give another half star for the first wash, but still lost half a star for not having a side chest pocket for me to clip a badge.  me: i\\'m 5\\'4&#34; and 120 lbs.  pros: fit is perfect. the material is very soft, but i don\\'t know how it will hold up in a wash. the top at the shoulders was measured perfectly. the length is half way down the glutes, so not too long, not too short. the torso is loose enough to accommodate a t-shirt underneath comfortably, which i plan to wear since my cna training will be in the fall and it\\'ll be cold. the extra pockets on the top are nice to have, although i\\'ll be wearing a fanny pack so the pockets may not be very useful. the pants have elastic at the back and flat in the front with secure string tie to ensure that my pants stay put. the pant length is spot on and i will not need to hem at all.  cons: since this scrub is white, the material is a bit thin, i can see the pant pocket lining through them. i will not be able to wear any other color bra underneath without it being slightly seen. but probably not an issue if i wear a t-shirt underneath. i was hoping there would be a side chest pocket where i can attach my badge. that would be nice to have since we are required to show our badge on the side chest.  overall, i\\'m happy with the purchase and the shipment and packaging was satisfactory. i won\\'t be getting more of this style, but i\\'ll definitely buy this brand again. i\\'ve ordered other scrubs from this company and currently awaiting shipment. this time, i made sure to get a thicker material (look at the material blend for that) and i made sure scrub top has a side chest pocket. i love these pants! i am 5\\'2 and a size 3. a small was a perfect fit. too bad they do not have a solid black color, the other options are too flashy for my taste. i read a review stating buy size up. glad i did as the fit is great. it so comforable.  even around the house is great.<br />love the snowflakes . i even got top with snowflakes. thanks. love them! they are awesome, my daughter loves them! the pants are awesome!!! love the low rise and the fit ! i would buy a tin of these just to have them for the future the are so comfortable...but, us side 8 isn\\'t 8. it\\'s more of a 10-12 us size ..just a heads up my daughter loves these pants, and they look very cute on her.  they run a little long, i had to hem them a couple inches. love these pants! very comfy, great for summer. wish i can find some just a little bit longer very comfortable love them! baggy and comfortable. the leggings are cute. they could have been a little larger. again the fabric is nice. the style is great, and new. i haven\\'t seen any like them yet. i would recommend  to a younger lady than myself. the fabric is very thing- so ordering these in a color aside from black would not be my recommendation. i love the black ones i got though - they are very stretchy and extremely comfortable. i am 5\\'9&#34; 155# and size 6. i ordered the large. they start to slip down on the waist over a day\\'s wear, but plenty long and flattering flare leg - hugs your back curves and wide flared leg is wider than the waist - very happy with this comfy lounger pant, esp considering the great price - but black panties is needed for the black pants, fyi . . . very nice and fits well. definitely worth the buy. my husband love this on me too many conditions for washing them. you have to use a special detergent so as to keep them looking good.  now i am almost afraid of using them.<br /><br />revised 08-11-13<br />i realized that you don\\'t have to wash it seperately etc. the pants are still intact and soft. but it is nice for them to give you suggestions to prolong you enjoy them. i had three starts from my previous review and have increased it to five stars. i love this set. it\\'s so comfortable. i plan to buy more in the other colors. perfect bike shorts, comfortable and very reasonably priced. i wear these while working out on my indoor exercise bike. the padding is just thick enough to do the trick. usually take a medium, ordered a large us version as indicated on the manufacture\\'s chart and size is perfect for me. i intend to hand wash and line dry them. perfect and i would like to order another pair, but it says they are out of them. im a size 00 or xs and i ordered these scared they would be to big but they fit nicely really excited these are the most comfortable pants!<br /><br />they do get a bit thin because they are not made of the highest grade material but then again i paid under $20.  i wore them once a week for a month and only recently started seeing them get rather thin.  i wear long shirts anyway though so i still wear them!  i like to hide my tummy and bum so my shirts always go below that line.  beyond that they are not tight enough to see through! love it!! wish it came in small medium and large. took so long to get but fits amazing and i love them so much ! i am happy with these except for the fact these did shrink a bit in the length after washing and drying.  i wash and dry in warm/cool really cute and comfortable.  love it for the price! they do fit but seemed quite large then i noted the plus size marking.  i still wear them, just gotta tie em up. in comparison to some other scrubs id say they run a little smaller. i\\'d get one size bigger. these are soft and look a lot nicer then regular scrub pants. i usually wear them with a nicer shirt and my white coat to the office and it has a more dressed up look then just regular scrubs. i love these scrub pants! i love these pants.. super soft and comfortable! good the top part of the romper is a bit snug.  but i was able to wear it all day without any problems.  however,  there are major design flaws. the straps should have a button closer.  instead they are attached to the top of the romper and are on the thin side. also, if you choose to wear the romper as pants, make sure you don\\'t drink a lot of coffee that day.  unbuttoning( and buttoning) the romper to go to the bathroom can take time.  snap closures would be a quicker alternative. all in all i do like this outfit. these are so cute! they came in on time and fit perfectly! thanks so much! as many of the other reviewers wrote - i love these pants, but can not find any more!!  i bought the kahki, went back and got the black, but can not find white.  the length and fit is perfect and they are extremely comfortable. would buy more if they had them! i bought these palazzo pants in black aztec because i am a salsa dancer and wanted a fun option to wear when i\\'m not in a dress. i needed something that would be higher-waisted (i.e., not low-rise), comfortable to wear, and have a longer inseam (i\\'m 5\\'8&#34; and wear dance heels, so it\\'s common for me to have pants that are too short). these pants are so much nicer than i anticipated, and they are amazing for the price. i usually wear a size 12 or 14 so i bought the xl. they fit nicely in the leg and bum, although i confess they are a tad tighter in the lower tummy area than i\\'d like. also, i will be hemming them from 34&#34; to 32.5&#34; for a perfect fit (wouldn\\'t want to trip while dancing). i think the pattern in black aztec is very nice; i didn\\'t have any problems about see-through material like other reviewers commented, mostly because the pattern sort-of camouflages that issue. overall, i\\'m really impressed and would buy them again. i ordered a large and usually tights are way too small on me (super thighs and butt over here) but they are the perfect amount of stretchy and they fit so well!!!!! it actually kind of holds in the less pretty parts of my curves so i look luscious. seriously, awesome. they are not see through but you want to wear no seam panties underneath. they are nice and shiny but not crazy. love it!!!!! also the waist panel is perfect, def holds in the tummy. my husband hates stretch pants, when i put these on he had me turn around, and he approved. they are comfortable, cool and dressy. i get tired f wearing sweat pants and pajama bottoms around the house when i need to charge my back stimulator. the only thing is i didn\\'t realize i ordered tall and they are very long, my bad, but i\\'m not sending them back. they are the only thing i wear that really show the size of my legs and my husband likes the way they look. good enough for me!! these pants are the perfit fit and are co comfortable. the material is lightweight and the price was great.  the fit was as expected (i\\'m a 12 and got a large).  they are somewhat fitted in the backside, but not super tight they were a little more form fitting than i expected, but i love them! i know now that i just need to order a size up. they arrived on time, with no shipping issues & will be buying from style creek again. perfect ! they give my natural curves a great extra slimming look they just run bigger than expected maybe next time i\\'ll get a smaller size arrived in good time, wrapped well, very well made, cooling pants that fans you while you walk, and keeps you cool all day. the color is just as bold as seen here online, and they are even more attractive once you put them on. you\\'ll look neat, graceful, pretty, and free. you will love them, and you will want to buy the other colors they have. super buy! excellent fits great leg length was just a bit too long these pants were a great buy. slightly loose and baggy like in the picture, but not too much. (i have an average slim build.) the cotton of the pant is solid good quality (a thick cotton fabric, not thin or sheer), and are sewn well. the color is not as vibrant and slightly more muted than in the picture, but it\\'s still very pretty. i do not regret the purchase. very unique looking! very comfortable~ soooooo adorable!! yes they are sheer- but i wear them with a pair of leggings underneath. i am 5\\'6&#34; and they fit good. if i was about 5\\'4&#34; that would be more ideal height for these pants. i love them though :) very nice! these pants are awesome and i will definitely order some more! soft and comfortable!!!. sometimes it is hard to buy clothes online because you never know if it will fit right. this product fit me, i follow the size chart and i was able to picked the right size for me. i love brilliant color this outfit fits great. fast delivery.  it\\'s a heavy jean which is good. looks just like the picture, but minus the collar. the stitching is not so great in some areas, which you can hand stitch over. i ordered two sizes up from other reviews. i\\'m an 3/4 to 5 depending on the making in american size. 5\\'5 in height and 125lbs. so i ordered a xl for a little extra room. the shorts fits exact since i have a little hips from having a baby. so if your bigger than a 4, it wont fit because it runs really small. but overall the outfit looks great on me, can\\'t wait to wear it. i love this pants , its really cute and arrived before time! fun to wear please bring these pants back .  i love these comfortable and stylish. easily dressed up for going out. love them!! love the no hem idea! the fit is great and they look great! was delivered quickly and i wore them the next day! packaging was great. got a lot of compliments. plan to do more business in the future comfortable but way too big. now i have to alter them. make sure you wash them before doing any alterations! funky and spirited..i wore these to work in the salon i work in and got soooo many compliments, super comfortable! i love how the draw string gives you the option to raise the crotch and change the shape. the different textures in the fabric give a different fit on the ankles, but nothing that is discernible. great material, but i wish i had ordered two sizes smaller. i was afraid it might run small, but it doesn\\'t. too large for working out, but great for pj. i love these bodishape plus size slimming pants/leggings. most often i find it really hard to find pants/leggings that won\\'t make more look bigger. these are cute and stylish leggings at the same time & do not fit wrong in all the wrong places for me. has 2 front zipper pockets mainly for style but i use them to keep a card & cash handy. i\\'m am very happy i got to try these out for my honest unbiased opinion. the fabric is thick & not flimsy like you generally would find elsewhere. nice and stretchy. the stitching is perfectly done. the pants feel great on me & i could live in them! also very very comfortable. the are a tiny bit big for me but i can always get them fixed. they are easy to take care of. overall i\\'m really satisfied with these & literally wearing them everywhere. and lastly i must say given the quality of these, they will last a good while! easy care! well worth the price. definitely recommend these. bought for my 80 yo aunt. she loves them! easy to get on and off. wash & dry! and good fit! love these! they fit perfectly and they are so cute! love the pants i worn them when i went out of town they are very comfortable i normally wears a medium. but from the review i got that it runs small  i went ahead and  ordered a large and it was the perfect fit. good material and fits just right i love it . i have owned several pairs of zip-off pants, and these are the most comfortable, best-fitting pair yet.  they\\'re not as baggy as the other brands, the material is light and comfortable, and truly quick-drying.  the length as pants and shorts work well for me.  i ordered the medium regular (31\\\\\\\\\" inseam) and they fit well.  i am somewhere between 5\\'5\\\\\\\\\" and 5\\'6\\\\\\\\\", 123 lbs.  i wear a 31\\\\\\\\\" inseam on my jeans, in usually a 6 (sometimes 5) and tend to prefer waists on the pants that sit below the true waist, just above the hips.  i do need to wear a belt with these as long pants to keep them from sliding down too far.  the waist on a size small might\\'ve fit better, but they would\\'ve been an inch shorter as long pants (30\\\\\\\\\" inseam instead).  hopefully this will help others determine their sizing.    they do dry fast and the material is soft and comfortable against the skin.  remove promptly from dryer to prevent wrinkles.  these were very convenient on a recent trip up the coast.  warm enough for cool, windy mornings and great for travel inland in 90s to 100 degree heat.  my husband has the men\\'s version and is quite pleased with it, too. really nice pants some review on here says this runs small. i do not think this is the case. i think the sizing is spot on. i usually buy size small. i bought this in a medium because if the reviews. i really could have gotten away with a small. as with all drawstring items, it fits fine because i can adjust that. my advice is to go ahead and order your normal size. also at least 4 strangers complemented me on this color each time i\\'ve worn it!!! great buy. i purchased these for my daughter for christmas. she loves the fit and the quality. they are very cute too! these jeggings are so cute and fit great. i am 5\\'4... not quite 130 pounds and normally wear a 6. i was worried about the sizing when looking at the size chart vs. the reviews. i went ahead and ordered the large (normally i would order a medium or small) and they fit perfect. i haven\\'t washed them yet and i don\\'t think i will put them in the the dryer once i do wash them as i think they might shrink a good bit. they are a bit long for me but i don\\'t mind how they look with a roll up the bottom to a cuff.<br /><br />so these do run quite small but look great when the right size is ordered! i took a chance on these pants because of the price, and i am so glad i did.  i loved my first pair so much i ordered another.  this seller has very good merchandise.  and the delivery was sooner than i expected.  a definate winner! this was for my daughter and she loves them.  they fit perfect and are very comfortable all while keeping a good shape.  she has passed on her recommendation. they are very comfy and fit with just enough bagginess in the hip area to notice that they are harem pants... honestly these can go casual or you can dress them up.. the only thing is that, on me they are a bit cropped.. meaning the hem line stops right at about an inch above my ankle.. so unlike the picture, they don\\'t go all the way to my ankle, unless you are petite... which i am not.. but overall they are still a great staple to have in the wardrobe... amazing pants!!! look like jeans and fit exactly like a legging. love them and fit great! very nice i loved them love these! i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; 110lbs got the size 28&#34; us small / asia medium and they fit great. nicer quality than what i was expecting. they would\\'ve been nice to lounge around in but at least for the moment, i can\\'t wear them because they definitely fit smaller than expected. i used the sizing chart and according to that a medium should\\'ve been a good fit. i almost feel like i\\'m putting on a pair of tight jeans so off to the side they go until (if?) i lose some weight. these are supposed to be a \\'loose\\' fit. that may be the case if you order up a size...or two. just be aware of that. other than that the material seems really good. these are so comfortable and perfect for under my summer skirts. super comfy! like it a lot but disappointed by the size is more like a small small love it!! very good service and product these leggings are seriously the best leggings i have ever purchased. i got my first pairs at marshall\\'s, wore them multiple times a week for a year, and they held up incredibly well. they are comfortable for the gym, and also look nice with sweaters and boots for daily wear. i am 5\\'10\\'\\' and have an hourglass shape, and sometimes have to buy an xl in shorts and leggings to fit my bum. a large fits comfortably in these, and they are the perfect length. if you are looking for a quality pair of leggings, look no more! buy these! the perfect alternative to shorts in a hot humid climate. the bright pink (and i bought the aqua blue) make the wrinkles that inevitably come with linen forgivable so they don\\'t look so frumpy and typical brown linen. they do &#34;give&#34; with wear. i ordered the 14 because i teeter between size 12 and 14. (i\\'m 5\\'10&#34; and 180lbs). i could have gotten the 12 i think but the 14 is fine for a casual look with t-shirts, etc. and they are long! perfect for me, right to the top of my foot. so you shorter ladies may have to adjust or wear with heels. the &#34;easy&#34; waist design makes them fairly customizable. overall a good value for the money and i love keeping the sun and bugs off my legs even when the weather is steamy. i love the material, color, but the fit was a little snug through the stomach and back side.  it wasn\\'t quite as ample as the other alfred dunner\\'s 16 shorts.<br /><br />because of the color and material i am keeping them. these pants are so fun. they waist is a little snug. but i snipped it and restitched it to my liking. also the striped leg does not stretch very much. as a result, they pants get pulled down from the leg. the black leg is fine and very stretchy. i wear a small and bought a small. they are tight around the hips (which i don\\'t have). i should have got a medium but i am going to regift them i think. i absolutely love these pants.  i am 4 feet 11inches tall (short-lol), size 3 and with very fit build.  prior to placing the order i was a bit concerned the pants wouldn\\'t work for my height/size.  after reading other reviews i decided to take the risk.  am i glad i did! these pants are perfect for me.<br />i agree with the reviews of others as it relates to the &#34;one size fits all.&#34; all who/what?  my opinion.....small, slim, petite ladies.  otherwise, &#34;one size fits all&#34; ....this statement is very misleading.<br />i can\\'t imagine how the curvy or plus size (confident/sexy/sassy) customer would find satisfaction with this product. in my opinion the waist is particularly small (could be a problem) for the curvy/plus size customer.  if purchased alterations will probably be needed.<br />i hope this review is helpful when deciding to purchase these awesome haram pants. comfortable, lots of pockets.  i am 5\\'8&#34; 138, fit great. very comfortable pants. i really like these jeggins. they are soft, thin and comfortable. the material/fabric is not see thru. im 65&#34; and 122 lbs.<br />i wear these with a longer shirt and they look great. my husband tough i had jeans on until he touch them. :) great fit my mom ordered the black n\\' white reindeer leggings for me ( which i really liked ) for my birthday ( february 5 ) around the end of january, and  i was disappointed that the estimate delivery date was around the 20\\'s of february because it was way past my birthday. i read the reviews and i got extremely worried that a. the fabric would rip easily. b. the reindeer would come upside down. c. they wouldn\\'t look as nice as in the picture. and i was just expecting the worst. but when they arrived ( a week earlier than the earliest estimate date ), i was shocked. of course i checked for the reindeer, which were perfectly fine, but it was just so much better than i was expecting rather than anticipating. so in my opinion, they\\'re great. i\\'m 5\\'3 and 98 pounds, so i\\'m not sure if it would fit evryone; just make sure to read the reviews before ordering. although others may not like it as much as i do, i\\'m assuming that my expecting of the worst made it seem a lot more awesome than it really is. either ways, i think that it\\'s worth the $6! right color and size, same as if i bought it in a store. would recommend for anyone who needs scrubs. outstanding product. exactly what i was looking for. these jeans are amazing, fit great, great quality and they look more expensive than they are! buy them if there any left. very nice for the price.  i was surprised to learn they should not go in the dryer. soooo comfortable; soft and not clingy.<br />loose like sweatpants, but still makes my butt look good (and i have a small one).<br />i think the colors are fun, but my husband says i look like a clown. everyone has their personal opinion. would be a 5 star except it shrinks a lot upon washing and i wash everything on cold and delicate.  would order again but at a larger size so i can wear for longer.<br /><br />updated: 10/24/2013<br />i also have to note that it fades badly too.  my black pants are now must more grey like.  probably will not order again. omg i love these they fit so good jus right jus the color i wanted i\\'m in heaven will recommen!!!!! perfect fit for a plus size short woman. i love these pants and will plan on buying more from this company. absolutely love these and they look great! i would recommend looking at the size chart for these before buying. i bought the &#34;regular&#34;, those go up to 160 lbs, and they fit well on me with my height @ 5\\'8. my daughter loves these pjs except they are very very large on her and long as well.  nice flannel material love these pants. they are warm and comfortable! i am so happy with my purchase. fits and looks great. i am 5\\'6&#34; height, size 4.<br />got many compliments. bought these to wear to our local annual mardi gras event at rhodes on the pawtuxet in rhode island..  we attend every year.  pants had to be hemmed professionally because of the material, but they fit great and are super comfortable. love it i thought these were &#34;jeans&#34; but they are a linen blend so much nicer than i expected.  they fit great.  they are white and linen so the fabric is a little thinner but perfect for summer and early fall love love love these pants!! i\\'m buying another pair! i bought a size up just so i got the same look as in the picture and they were spot on!! they are totally cute and i have gotten tons of compliments on them! very well made. nothing cheap about these pajamas. i ordered a large so i have a loose fit. i find them very comfortable... sent the wrong pair, but they\\'re still cute. theyre the same just in black. im 5&#34;0 and wear a size 2 i bought a few pairs of these pants a few years ago and loved them. i haven\\'t been able to find them until recently! very excited! great pants that lasted through workouts and pregnancy! nice good price, good quality, arrived well packed, compliance date of delivery. these are my favorite and never dissapoint. sexy in the gym, these pants fit awesome and true to size!! i own 2 pairs of these (so far) they are my favorite pants!  so much more comfortable than any other capris i own.  the fit is very flattering, even for my not so great shape. comfy and can\\'t wait to tie dye them these pants are perfect. i have to dress well for my job and its hard to find clothes that are both dressy and comfortable but these pants do it. they hold their shape so well and wash well too. love them and will buy more. i bought this for my daughter and she was overall happy. the stitchings aren\\'t good at all, and she claims the pants won\\'t last long. other than that, the fit is good (she\\'s 5\\'7 and 115lbs). the large fit really good they are snugged to my body almost like leggings so if you want something sot so tight get a size larger only the smalls were somewhat large but nothing we couldn\\'t deal with. all other sizes fit great! these shorts fit like a glove and perfect for petite women i luv them very cute these are so cute!!! they are slightly sheer so i bought some white boy short underwear and they work great! great vibrant colors, well made. i am a size 12 and the xl are perfect. you may be able to wear them if you are a smaller 14 as they are comfortably loose on me but not too loose. just really comfortable. i had originally purchased a large and they were fine in the front but just too small in the seat. if you are a 9 or 10 the l would probably work very well for you! excelente a very nice legging. so comfortable and soft. also the length is perfect, long enough so they look great! very glad i bought them exelente lo recomiendo, un exelente vendedor muy atento y cumplidor like it a lot, very nice and comfortable. good and well made. i loved it! i did as the other reviewers said and went two sizes up. i normally wear between a medium/large depending on the fabric. i am a very busting girl with big hips as well so i wanted the loose fit so i went with the xl and it fits perfect. love them i ordered these in red and i absolutely love them!!! i\\'m a size 5 and ordered a large. they fit perfectly!! i\\'m ordering purple now. this is my first danskin product so i didn\\'t know what to expect. the quality is really nice and they\\'re very comfy to wear. i chose navy looking for a very specific color and the fabriccolor is true to it\\'s name. i haven\\'t measured the inseam but it seems longer than 31&#34;. i normally wear a 30&#34; seam so i\\'ll need to hem them. still, it\\'s a good buy and not a bad price. beautiful jumpsuit.  fabric feels amazing.  quality is quite nice...better than i expected. i am on the taller side, 5\\'9&#34; and usually cannot find pants like this that are long enough, but these are.  i have worn them several times and received compliments each time.  they are well made and wash/dry nicely. seemed like a good product, but was to big for my wife.  returning. very nice! perfect! love it! great fit probably one of the most comfortable pair of linen pants i own. runs true to size. the only downside is that after wearing them for a couple of hours the top of the pants stretches out and you have to keep pulling them up, other than that these are a perfect pair of linen pants. not to sheer...not scratchy...a really soft linen.. love it...so cute love these pants. very comfortable for work. these are my favorite leggings.  i\\'m 5\\'7&#34; 125lb and they fit great.  not too tight at the top, and they don\\'t slip down.  the print still looks awesome after dozens of washes.  the only sad things is a bit of pilling on the hips area, but it\\'s not affecting the print and it\\'s barely noticeable so i\\'ll wear them until i can\\'t. i love these pants so much i\\'ve purchased them twice.  they are linen but comfortable with the yoga waist band.  the pack well and look very classic.  i bought the black and white and wore them all over rome and paris.  my only complaint is the waist band stretches out after one season.  they are cheap enough that i just bought more for this year.  the length is extremely long so if you are tall you\\'ll love them (i had to have the hem taken up) i bought these jeggings not knowing what to expect, especially reading some of the reviews. i measured myself and bought 2 of these (before making a commitment and buying a whole bunch). the sizes i bought fit me perfectly! just measure yourself and double check the size chart before you make any purchases! i am definitely buying more!<br /><br />can you make these in teal please?! :) fit great on my 13yo daughter. a little see thru, but nothing major. very cute these pants shipped much faster than i expected and well within the allotted timeline.<br /><br />the pants are a solid black.  i\\'ve washed and tumble dryed them already and they held the color well.<br /><br />i love cargo pants for dog walking - lots of places to stash treats, poop bags, money, phone, keys etc.  its difficult to find funky cargo pants for women as they\\'re no longer really in fashion so these are a great find.<br /><br />i purchased the 2xl/32 which has zero to do with us sizing.  in the us i am a solid 8 pant.  so if you\\'re an 8 the 2xl/32 should fit you. great fit and great looking cargo pants. i get compliments every day i wear them. they fit just right (as expected) and are really comfortable (just like they\\'re supposed to be). they\\'re well made, out of sturdy material. they look like they can take a beating. living in florida, i really wish they made them in a thinner material, so i can wear them during the hot summer days. i got them in army green -- really nice color. i\\'m thinking of getting them in camo too. my only con would be that the bigger side pockets are not actually that big: they\\'re two side by side smaller pockets creating the illusion of one pocket, so you can\\'t actually fit anything in them, except maybe a lighter if you\\'re a smoker. but i bought them more for style rather than function, so that doesn\\'t bother me much. i\\'m just mentioning this for those of you looking for big pockets -- this might not be the pair for you. great pants especially for the super low price. wish they had more color choices though. i ordered the gray 1 in small. they fit loose, but very soft and comfortable pants. 100% cotton!!! bought 2 pairs which will get much use!!! i hope they had more colors, i have purple and navy blue. i love this item. so comfortable and sassy. my measurements around my hipbones is 31in & 36in around the booty. i wear ladies sz 2 or jrs sz 5 or 7. after reading the reviews i bought a medium. they were comfortable but a bit loose. i kept them for comfyness then ordered a small. the fit is an itsy bit snug on the bum until i sit a couple times. then the linen stretches just a bit making the fit perfect. they did not shrink at all after washing/drying. love them very comfy excellent i titled this they way i did because sometimes i question the validity of gleaming reviews. these pants came in a matter of mere days... from india!? i was shocked when dhl rang my buzzer. they are beyond stunning. i actually held my breath while opening it almost afraid to see what patterns i got. i calmed myself with a reminder that i can always return them through prime with ease. no need to return. these are gorgeous! each pattern on both sides is lovely. the waistbands and edging are done in a third pattern. the only very small down side is because they are 80% silk, they are dry-clean only. a very small price to pay. i purchased these pants thinking i would wear them around the house with my toddler but now i am hesitant to do so because they are just too pretty to mess up with toddler activites and cooking/cleaning!! i will try to remember to post some pictures as i wear them as the one reviewer who posted a picture of her pants was the only reason i decided to take the leap of faith. as a side note, i am 5\\'2&#34; about 125 and these fit beautifully. they are longer, so they would fit a taller person as well. i tied them up nearer to my natural waist and the length works with flat sandals. beautiful love how the fabric feels!! i\\'m 5\\' 3&#34; and 120lbs (ordered x-small petite) and these scrub pants fit perfectly!! i have always been satisfied with purchases made from women-within.  they know that plus-size women like to be in style and have nice looking clothes and they provide us with that. the jumpsuit fits well, the material is heavy polyester.  i get many compliments.  wish they had more colors these pants feel like pyjamas, but fit and look dressy.  the fabric is very thin,  but it is soft and not see through.  they  have a really nice stretch, and the fordable waist is really great since you can adjust them length wise a fair bit.  (at first i thought i bought the wrong size, but once i tried them on and folded over the waist, they fit perfectly!) i loved the material it was perfect.  i wish it was in white also colors are darker than pictured but great pants these sweatpants are great for winter-time and so soft, warm and comfortable.  the pockets are great and it is so hard to find any women\\'s sweatpants with pockets - like we don\\'t need them - not!  i am really happy i found these! fun love these pants i am 5\\'7 145lbs fit/athletic. i looooooooooove these pants and will be buying in every color! i bought a medium but will probably order my future colors in small. these fit well enough, but are a little loose in the waist. the longish length is great because like to wear different types of shoes (wedges & flats) i was pleasantly surprised that the scrubs were much better then i thought.<br />very soft fabric, not too thin and durable. i will be buying more of them. thanks! one of my fav workout outfits. it\\'s stylish and fits great. you can\\'t beat the price either. i plan to order more. it is a good pant perfect for prego girls! i wear these everywhere! coolest looking &#34;pants&#34; ever. so comfortable, but still interesting enough style-wise to not feel like a schlub. some things from ellazhu are conceptually interesting, but poorly executed. with the baggy harem pants, i think they are both nicely constructed and cleverly designed. the waistband is just elastic in a casing, so it\\'s not the best solution ever, but with a top that covers the waistband, you\\'re good to go. also the lower leg portion of the pants is a little loose, so stuffing them inside boots is pretty much required to achieve the look. bottom line, i love them. maybe ella zhu is a talented (perhaps fledgling) designer. i don\\'t know.  but i\\'m enjoying experimenting with many of the looks.<br /><br />oh, almost forgot to mention. i\\'m 5\\'8, 130 lbs. and they fit about like you see in the pic. plenty of room. comfy, well-fitting shorts made with swimsuit-type material; they fit mostly as expected. i ordered a size l, and i usually wear pants size 8. good for coverage when swimming! my sister love them nice fabric and cool pattern these are very flattering pants, though i am size 4, i think they would look good on anyone, if you have some hippy or tummy issues, you can wear a tunic top.  they were too long, so i just cut 6 inches off the bottom and didn\\'t hem them,<br />( i can\\'t sew that slippery polyester fabric.)  i have many compliments on these pants.<br /> if you want to cut them shorter as in capri pants and wear with sandals, that works too. these pants are great! light weight but not too much, fun and a really a  super value. they come hemmed and were actually the perfect length. some of the other palazzo pants i have came unhemmed but you just cut them. i bought this pair as a gift for a friend. she loved mine so much that she asked for them! i get comments on them everywhere i go and as an added bonus they don\\'t wrinkle so are great for travel too. just get them! the best i love this products i ordered these in a medium and i wore them to the gym for the first time yesterday. i am 5\\'6 180lbs and working on losing 40 lbs.<br />these are see through but not too noticeably see through. i could see my legs at the top but i have fat thighs. i could not see the calves. the band at the top is convenient if you want a little more length and the color is a nice option as well.<br />i\\'ll probably buy a few more colors. they are a good price.<br />they washed and dried well with no shrinking or fading as of yet. when i was at the gym they stayed up through my 4 miles on the elliptical.<br />i am going to wear them to kick boxing next week and see how well they perform.<br />i bought some pants similar to this at rue21 and they did cost more than i paid here and weren\\'t made as well. perfect. although the pants are big and baggy on me, and the shirt is a little tight under the underarms. i got a size over (l) what i usually wear. recommend. great good quality.  good price. good coverage without heating up the body too much. it\\'s very nice.......love it. good quality. i own a few pairs of sweats from aero i bought them for my early morning classes to be comfy and not look like a bum and i ordered these ones grabbed them out of the package had no idea they were gonna me fleece they are so warm and comfy i have had them on all day great leggings. they\\'re comfy and fit well (i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; and about 115 lbs, but they\\'re stretchy and could definitely fit someone bigger). plus, the fabric is amazing. just super, super soft. i wear size 6 pants (and i\\'m quite curvy - i have to go with &#34;curvy&#34; option on all my pants, like ann taylor or talbots) and small fits great in this. the waste is quite high (i guess you can fold it if you want), but it actually looks great as is (though usually i\\'m not a huge fan of high waste).  the pattern on the bottom doesn\\'t look too obnoxious (i was afraid i\\'m going to look like a hippie) - so it\\'s great.  material is quite stretchy and there are built-in shorts inside which are made of also stretchy fabric. so these actally work for curvy girls! this stretch polyester fabric looks higher quality than i anticipated, and it is very comfortable.  the calves are very slim, though, so be sure to order accordingly.  i am very pleased with this purchase. these are comfortable and nice to wear.  will purchase more. i\\'m 5\\'10&#34; and these were actually long enough for me, i love them! the fit is nice...i can\\'t wear leggings, but these work just fine.  light weight like them.  they are thin and not lined, but are comfortable pants. good fit too long for petite. very nice. thin material these are perfect for the busy rn who wants a lot of pockets. they look professional and are very comfortable. i would definitely recommend!! these pants are very comfortable! i\\'ve bought them to wear at home. i chose the free size, and the waist fits fine (i have a 40-inch waist). i\\'m 5\\'3&#34;, and i wear the pants high, at my natural waist (3.5 inches above the bellybutton), so i wish the legs were just a tad longer, but everything else looks great. the material is very soft and lightweight. i bought these in the olive green and maroon- this last color is a little darker and more soothing than the picture online (yay!) if they hold up to washing, i will be buying several more, in different colors. i love the pants but am hard to fit. they were great in the waist but way too flowy at the bottom of the leg. cool and comfortable but super long on me. i\\'m pretty average 5\\'6&#34; 150lbs but curvy so i ordered a large. they were just what i wanted but just a little to small. but i would recommend your pants for purchase. i love these pj pants.  the legs aren\\'t too wide and the waist fits comfortably.  nice material, not hot, good length. i love the item it has a great design too bad you guys don\\'t have another color for the display picture so customers could see the true design, anywho i love the navy color can\\'t wait to wear, this will def. mesh well with tan-brown. these pants are exactly what i want to wear! thank you for making them in petite. daughter loves these. it\\'s gorgeous, very nice fabric and 100% cotton which is great. one downer, it\\'s one size fits all but to tight for my medium build. i love these!  they\\'re wild!  fit great. look even better than the picture. speedy shipping. love it excellent very nice pants- the perfect weight fleece- not so heavy that they are too warm to sleep in but very cozy.  love them! fit real nice material so soft and they wash nice and dry great. i am in the process of buying 2 more pair. this was my first experience with amazon.  i purchased the pants along with biotin (a supplement), which arrived perfectly sealed outwardly, and plenty of cotton baton to protect the product internally. i\\'ve written a separate review on the biotin.    the pants are as described, a perfect fit and a quality make.  i love how they fit and look (the sizing chart is accurate). the linen is light, yet durable. perfect for warmer seasons, but i can see where body-fitting leggings underneath these pants would make them wearable in colder seasons as well. well-made item also, with finished edges and small, sturdy stitching along seams.  the top of the pants are made of a soft, stretchy material that comfortably clings to your body form, without leaving telltale signs on your skin.  extremely comfortable when wearing, with ease of movement.    it is wise to wash clothing once before wearing, when items are first purchased.  this gets rid of the \\'factory\\' and/or \\'packaging\\' odours that often occur. dust, grime, contaminants and/or slight (but mostly unnoticeable) soiling that may occur during handling and packaging can quickly be washed away. also, if the material is going to shrink, it will occur during the first washing (see below  for further explanation).    the pants are machine-washable, but also can be hand washed for light soiling.  i like hanging clothes out to dry. these pants air-dry nicely. i simply lay the pants out and run my hand across the fabric, then use downward strokes to help press out wrinkles (flip pants over and repeat on the other side).  air-drying takes out more wrinkles.  some people will be quite satisfied to wear the pants fresh off the line, whilst others may want to apply a low-heat iron to give the pants a well-pressed look.  linen ofttimes requires pressing, but these light linen pants will require little to no ironing, depending on individual preferences.     i have not dried them in a machine yet, but given the quality of the weave, i wouldestimate that doing so would be safe without great concern of shrinkage. however, since i have not used a machine to dry these pants, i would definitely tumble dry them at a lower than normal heat setting, until i was completely confident that the pants would not drastically shrink.(some pants are pre-shrunk, but state so on labels. if an item does not say \\\\\\\\\"pre-washed\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\"pre-shrunk\\\\\\\\\", do understand that most materials shrink slightly upon the first washing.  some (like wools and/or wool blends) may shrink drastically or noticeably.  some wool/wool blends items, when improperly washed (particularly in hot water, rather than the recommended tepid [lukewarm] or cooler water temperatures)have been known to shrink one or more sizes.  use precaution and wisdom.    i recommend washing the white,light cotton linen pants with other whites, or color-fast items.  it is not recommended to take a chance on dyes from other clothing items bleeding into this quality light cotton linen.  wisdom in foresight that is acted upon negates hindsight filled with regret. kudos! fits kind of small, but what can you expect from scrubs? product is as advertised except should have ordered a size smaller.  fleece is warm and comfort and that\\'s what i wanted.<br />quality if good and i would recommend them - except of the sizing. these are perfect for winter, i mean, i\\'m from a place where snow is not there (torrid zone), i\\'m experiencing my first winter ever, so i have to wear 2 of this, but still, it works for me like that. i got one of each color so i match them with oversized sweaters, looks so cute. i love these! they\\'re insanely comfortable and great for either wearing around the house or going through a dance rehearsal! i\\'l definitely be getting  another pair! great fit and awesome buy! does not stretch and sequins rub together and come off. this was perfect for a christmas party but i doubt i will wear again because there in zero stretch room for your butt.  i couldn\\'t really sit down without feeling like these pants were going to burst.  i am 5\\'9 135 lbs and am athletically built.  i got a small, but i believe a medium would have been perfect. very nice product  recommended! this is a very well fitting pair of pants. they\\'re nice enough for work, and that\\'s pretty good for ponte knit. love em. very pleased. thank you!! had no idea what i was doing size wise so my fault... i own several pairs of these, and love every one of them. i have them in black and navy, and the color is great, even after frequent washings. there is a small navy logo of my school on my scrub top that matches the pants perfectly. the front/hip pockets are convenient and deep, i love that the back pockets have velcro and if you fill them all up, all of your junk is held up without falling down (and exposing your buttcrack) with a sturdy tie-string at the waist. i\\'m 5\\'9&#34; and bought the x-tall, what is nice is that there is a small draw-string at the bottom, so they still don\\'t drag on the ground even though they are long. highly recommended. this panties are extremely comfortable and smooth. as a male long frustrated with the limited selection of male underwear, usually cotton, white and somewhat binding, these panties are great. they provide all day comfort, do not bind or pinch, and provide the needed support. the satin trim provides a bit of sexiness. the high-cut style moves well with the body and ensures freedom of movement during activities. finally, they retain their smoothness and shape wash after wash. one of my favorite pair of panties. i haven\\'t had the chance to wear or even try these on yet. i did inspect them upon receipt and they are constructed well and look very nice. cannot comment on fit at this time. i bought these joggers in gray. i have really toned legs from weight-lifting. my thighs are on the &#34;bigger&#34;/muscular side and have a flat stomach. the size large fit me perfectly. they are comfy and look like as pictured. i like it to wear around the house or just go to the supermarket or something like that. oh and it shipped fast also. this is the 2nd pair i purchased and i love this pair more because of the pockets.  comfortable & cute. fabric is perfect....not too thin,  not too thick. i have gotten used to buying small bottoms since i have been wearing scrubs. usually i am a medium girl. with these pants, you want to buy as you would with any other pair of pants. i got small and wish i had gotten medium. they are little tight at the waist and bum and aren\\'t very forgiving to panty-lines. these pants are super cute and made of high quality material that feels comfortable in the water. the only thing to be wary of is the fit; for example, i usually wear a medium, but ordered a large due to the sizing chart, which was perfect. these pants made it possible for me to feel comfortable in a bathing suit for the first time in years! also, the sun protection is a major bonus since you don\\'t have to slather on a bunch of sunscreen every 1-2 hours during a beach day. highly recommended! good for the price. cute, i like the rhinestones. fit like the size chart said. i just wish they weren\\'t so thin, i expected the material to be a little thicker i absolutely love this tights!! they are very comfortable, stretchy and look exactly like the picture, it fits really good. i might buy it in all the different colors. it\\'s worth the money.\\x1a very comfortable, can even pass as dress pants for work.  price is good and would like to buy a few more pairs. very comfortable!  :-) i ordered a 3x for workout pants. wash up nicely, no wrinkling, roomy in the seat and true to length. i would suggest going one size smaller to due to stretch. great costumer support soft light weight comfortable bought another pair right after this arrived i wish i could wear them year round! love them! i\\'m 5\\'8&#34; and 125 lb and they look awesome! long and cute and prehaps a bit snug , but try came quickly, the price was awesome and i\\'m happy with them. soft material and flattering even for my big thighs i love them.  they are very comfortable and feel great. love these pants gonna buy more colors. they are super tiny but stretch to fit. they actually do a good job of holding me in! the design logo came off pretty quickly after washing but the pants seem to be pretty good quality. loose, light, comfortable, and such a cool print, i want these in every shape and size. they\\'re my go-to pants for relaxed days, sleep, grocery runs, and i definitely need more in my life. these pajamas are really cute and have a decent quality. definitely worth it. they\\'re very comfortable too! love love love koi scrubs. i am small and only 5\\'1&#34; , and the koi small petite are perfect, i have worn many other brands of scrubs over the years, and nothing compares to koi. working with animals you want to be comfortable, and koi delivers just that.  they are immediately soft when first bought and that\\'s just awesome.  it would take many washes for other scrubs to not feel so starchy.  i will continue to buy koi scrubs from amazon.  even the xsmall fit well. love them! they fit as expected and are soft and comfy. i wear them during a high intensity spinning class and was scepticle that they would become wet and sweaty, but that was not the case! they held up like any dri-fit material. they are light and breathable without being cheap and see-through. i especially like the length! i am tall and have to order long sizes/extended inseams, but these fit perfectly! it is an amazing deal for the price! kinda thin and see through great fit! i love the style! perfect amount of pockets! recommend buying one size larger if you want any room to move. however the construction is good. i\\'m 5\\'6 and 105 lbs...finding scrubs that fit is impossible. xxs fit so perfectly! and the material of these pants is so worth the extra money. they\\'re super soft and super comfy. i bought other brands that were much cheaper, but i wear these 40 hours a week, so the few extra bucks is worth the comfort! from what i can tell so far, the color holds up well in the wash. they definitely run small and thinner than other brands (pants and tops). the material, although very soft, is very lightweight, so they\\'re not great when i\\'m walking into work in sub-freezing temperatures, but that\\'s the only issue i have with them! these are so nice-i love them! i love these pants. i am a pretty average sized girl, 5\\'6&#34;, 125. and almost everything from lulu lemon is way to long.<br />these are better in every way. first of all, organic!!!! 2nd. they fit perfect are so soft! and the design is super cute, they are my new fav! the pockets stick out more than in the picture, but it\\'s super easy to fix. love it. fits great!!!!! i love these! i actually own two. but i bought these while loosing weight.. and after ive lost weight the size small is too big! please make a size xsmall + xxsmall comfortable.  thank you for the quick transaction. i will recommend to friends and family. these are great and very soft! the pant leg is very wide and flowy like wearing a dress! i will get another pair! i was supposed to receive them may 20th- june 5th but i received them today! i\\'ve bought a pair before and i love them but one down fall these came with some smudges on then which was weird. i love it love it. :d recieved my cute palazzo pants in a timely manner...ordered 5 pair...will order more..i wear a lot of sun dresses,,,, and travel often...the material the same as the sun dresses...easy wash wear,,, travel. .<br />wrinkle free...so vougue. bought these for my thirteen yr old son who lives in them. they are comfy and also look good at the same time they look more blue the price was unbeatable. it was better than i expected. delivery was fast :) just what my daughter wanted. these are great if you need anything more than a 32in inseam. they are the only scrubs i buy and will not fade in the wash! excelente that seller shipped me few days ago, i receive it really quick.<br />the product just as described, fit my size exactly like i though!<br /><br />thanks alot! i absolutely love these pants. i love different. and these pants are different. the only problem is they are a little see through, but nothing and over sized shirt can fix. great pair of learher jeans. still haven\\'t worn them but will surw make a great outfit. loved them! these pants are beautifully lined and nicely made. i wish they were longer but i can wear with boots. i\\'m 5\\'8&#34;,115-120 lbs. for reference. i love them but my husband is not so happy i\\'m not sure why because they fit and flatter i think it is the pattern that he can\\'t get beyond, i am going to try a solid colour and see if that helps. i love them and will buy more.. i\\'m 158cm and around 110 lbs.  i got a small.<br />originally i thought it\\'s too baggy but the waist adjustment string makes it fit my waist very well so i kept it till my butt pads and knee pads arrive.when i wear my butt pads and knee pads underneath it, i totally understand why they make it so baggy.  it\\'s probably meant to accommodate any kinds of protective guards.  with my butt pads and knee pads underneath it, it fits perfect now. fits very well a little small but i love them! a little snug in the thighs, but i love these leggings! i really like these lounge pants.  i have a hard time finding pants that are long enough, and with about a 33&#34; inseam (for the size l) these are just what i was looking for.  i washed them once, and they did not shrink, so i immediately ordered another pair.  would buy more if they came in more colors.  gotta love the price too! excellent fit and most impressive reproduction of star wars characters! i\\'m a 5\\'3&#34; 125lb. woman and the leggings fit and looked great! love this suit! i was very pleasantly supeised! i\\'m 5\\'1&#34; and very petite. i can never find scrubs that fit but these fit perfect! and the pants aren\\'t too long! fabric is much nicer than anticipated as well. i\\'m purchasing more right now! it was a little close ... but i love it, i will buy it again the soul organic skirted pants are nice! they are so nice  i\\'ll say again twice nice nice! women\\'s licensed plush pajama pants, with mickey and minnie design. these pajama pants are so plush and soft. i bought them for my granddaughter and she loves them. the quality is outstanding. good quality linen - not too thick, not too thin.  fits as expected.  i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; and had to shorten them by about 4&#34;.  great value for the price. was an okay fit for elderly woman, but would need to adjust sizing for someone else not use to this brand. very comfortable i desperately wanted these to fit, they are great if you have skinner legs (not much give). i do a lot of running, hence have solid calves...way to tight. i am upset as they are a fab cut and would have looked great...not to mention great price! i got these a size smaller than what i thought i should and they were still about 2 sizes too big. returned and reordering because they were nice pants otherwise. can\\'t wait to get the new ones! i must of gained weight-too small gets the job done, fits under regular shorts or pants. sexy tigress. i\\'m a curvy 5&#34;11 169 lbs and these fit sexy on me. no pulling and tugging on my derri&egrave;re area i bought these large so i would have room and they are alittle larger than i thought they would be. overall i love this style of pants and that is all i will buy. fast shipping on this item. so many compliments on them!! cool!! these pants are great. they are light weight and incredibly comfortable. i\\'m 5\\'8&#34; and the length is perfect! excellent fit, very pleased with the product and service. these were made of a quality material.  fit good.  so worth their money. i returned the item! fit great no matter what your size is!! fit perfect! im 5\\'8, 150 lbs. got the xl and i love them! very comfortable. material feels like soft pj\\'s but dress up perfect! good fit great in the legs. waist a bit short. they are pretty though. wife likes them. good considering price. the cut and fit of these pants are good overall, except that they come very close to my rib cage. i wish they would make these fold down style so you can adjust how high it sits on your waist. it is so high, its almost uncomfortable. the materiel is a medium weight, not too thin like some yoga pants. the length was perfect for me. the are so comfortable and are great for both a casual and sporty look. i dare say you could even wear them as dress pants and no one would know the wiser due to how they are cut and shaped, plus the material. the only issue, which is why i did not give them 5 stars: they run large. i bought a medium, but he felt more like a large, or even an x-large. i want to buy another pair in a different color, so i\\'m going to go down to a small next time and see how that goes because it also doesn\\'t take many wears for them to stretch. and seeing as they were already bordering being too large in the first place, them stretching did no favors. (they kind of fall down now). i would definitely recommend going a size smaller, if you can. i bought this and a few other palazzo pants and they are amazing! the size was true to its description and it was so comfy.  i wore it to a wedding at a time where i had homonal imbalances and had gained a sudden 20lb and wanted to cover that as much as possible, and i have never attended a wedding with such comfort desipte my weight gain.  it can be dressed up or down.  i\\'m 5\\'1&#34; and i found the height to be great with a few inches of heal. these panties are so comfortable and soft with a bit of stretch.  someone else mentioned that they run small.  i wear a 6 and i felt that they ran just a tad large. i would have liked to have had them a tiny bit smaller because the stretch is so nice.  i rate them a 10 for comfort level, you just can\\'t beat them.  they come in some other very nice colors also but you have to look for them.  i do like my hi-cuts just a bit more hi-cut, hence the four star, but for someone who likes a little more coverage these are great!!!!!  the picture i would say is not completely accurate as they look a bit more hi - cut than they actually are.  still, these are probably one of the most comfortable pair of panties on the market. loved these pair of pants! i ordered the large and it fit perfect, loose and thin and incredibly comfortable.<br />it\\'s definitely see-through, but i love that about the pants. they are really comfortable and stylish once you wear them and get them &#34;molded&#34; to your shape, i do suggest buying a size up if you dont want tight fitting pants. i work in a retail setting and am required to have black or khaki slacks as part of my uniform.  i tend to have trouble finding pants that fit me, but these were a godsend.  the waistband can be rolled up or down (i\\'m pretty short, so i keep it rolled down so it doesn\\'t go halfway to my chest) and is elastic inside a soft, stretchy band of fabric.  there are strings that can be tied for an adjustable fit, but if you roll the waistband down you can tuck the strings inside and no one will notice.  the black ones look like normal pants with a cargo pocket on the side (the pocket doesn\\'t stick out so it\\'s not obvious unless you stuff things inside it- which i do).<br /><br />one note- if you\\'re required to wear a belt, this particular style is not a good option, as there are no belt-loops. there really nice i\\'m 5\\'8 and skinny and a medium for me perfectly and they are thin material so you get cold easily other than that i love them the material and style were as expected and good quality, but the sizing was a little off. i\\'m hoping they\\'ll shrink a bit when washed. a perfect fit. i buy these for my 99 year old mother in law.  she particularly likes the stretch  waistband and they fit her perfectly love the color! they\\'re really comfy. i\\'m 5\\'6 150 lbs... i got a medium and after washing them they fit fine. i personally like a tighter fit so i\\'m considering purchasing a different color and going to small this time. still very comfortable, but this pair fits just a little more snug than my 3 other pair. love these pants! great fit. wash and wear very well. i\\'ll definitely buy these in more colors. comfy and flattering. very comfortable, plenty of pockets. i usually wear medium, but these had to order small. totally comfortable. these are my spring palazzo\\'s with a tank and some cute sandals. boom easy breezy great capris.  easy wear easy wash. love these very nice pants. i would recommend. these are super comfy! the legs are a bit wider than expected but they are so comfy who cares?! fun i bought one pair and liked them so much that i bought another pair! overall good fit and perfect length. i am 5\\'11&#34;and so the pants fits beautifullu. very attacive with a wide leg that allows me to wear heels. well made. will buy in other colors as perfet for business or out to dinne when i ordered these i wondered how they could be 1 size fits most. then i received them and got a little worried when i saw the size on the inside of the leggings listed as small/med. i tried them on and they do fit! (i usually wear an xl). i like the rhinestone trim on the bottom. the one thing i wasn\\'t expecting is that they have stripes embossed up the side of the legs. they are made of thinner material than most leggings. i would think this is cheap material but i think it makes the fabric more stretchy. also being in az in the summer it might be to my benefit.<br />order arrived faster than expected and in good condition. i have had no contact with customer service. love them i love these beautiful pants. i\\'m into yoga and my daughters love these types of pants too. i bought one pair to try them out. i liked them sooo much that i ordered 2 more, in different colors, and i\\'m planning on buying more too. awesome! great price! perfect fit for my sister who is 5 feel 4 inches. love the fabric. i\\'m short 5\\'5 or so to be exact... they are very comfortable they fit fine around the wasite size wise but the legnth it likes to  ride up make next time i\\'ll get regular length and not petite. best scrubs pants out there this pant is soft, fits very well, and launders beautifully.  after multiple washings, this pant stills looks almost new.  will be adding more colors of this pant - also capris and shorts - to my closet. cute linen pants. pretty true to size. the fold over band is thin. i definitaly recommend these to anyone with really long legs! it is really hard to find someone that can hem them up! but other than that they fit great, just a little thin! i wear mine with heels you wouldn\\'t regret buying these very classy and comfy!!!!! thin material, see-through, but will wear spandex underneath, no worries i encourage anyone to get a size smaller. i got my size and even though the length is fabulous ... the waist is too big.. but hey.. i will work with it.. the material is nice and color don\\'t fade easily. .. nice i loved the fit and the color. exactly what i needed for the beach. they were comfortable and perfect. i\\'ll be buying another pair. they didn\\'t ride up that much, only like when coming out of the water. love these cargos. got them in another color. there sporty in a sexy kind of way. purchased for our daughter.  she wears it often.  no complaints.  washes/dries without issues.  would purchase again if and when the time is right. perfect! exactly as pictured! a little worried when i saw then mouth of the package, but when i tried them on, they looked awesome! i love them they fit perfectly and i don\\'t know how this happened but i do have amazon prime and i ordered them on a monday and they arived on a sunday i don\\'t know if that\\'s a new policy but it is amazing super fast shipping these are comfortable yoga pants that fit as advertised! i wear a 10-12 and large was perfect. seem to be well made, i have no complaints! i have been a nurse for 4 years now and i have never came across a pair of scrubs this comfortable. i had originally ordered 2 pairs and as soon i received them in the mail and tried them on i had to order 2 more. i can say i will be wearing this brand while working in the medical field. if you can buy only one pair of slacks this year, this is it! these can be dressed up or down, and fit like a glove. i am 5ft.5in., and 130 lbs., usually a size 6, sometimes 4. these slacks fit me perfectly in a 6, are definitely figure flattering, fitting close, but ever so comfortably! you can move easily while looking great! even the length is perfect!      these slacks have the look that i have spent up to $200 for, simply because a good fit with style is so difficult to find. but here it is for $29.99. issac and target, we love you!!      can\\'t wait to wear them with a crisp white shirt, and if i\\'m lucky enough to find it, perhaps that cute corduroy blazer, in the sold out hot pink!!! it\\'s a look! fits great!  love them!!  they are better than i expected them to be. i will recommend it to anybody any day anytime,buy it i guarantee,you wont regret it,pls take note there are different kinds,make sure you get c 13,is the best i really like them! cute and they fit as expected. they were a great buy and i recommend to anyone who loves adventure time. these pants fit me really well and i like the look and texture of the pants.  so often nowadays, petite pants are still too long for me as i am only 5\\'1&#34;.  these did touch the floor when i put them on but i feel with washing and wearing they should shorten to a good length.  i highly recommend. fits great!!!!! love them on my long bike rides!!!! perfect! they do run a bit larger than expected but not so much that i would exchange them. they are very comfortable.  wash and dry well without shrinkage. very thin material so they\\'re pretty cool to wear during the summer. very attention grabbing, especially when going to music festivals. soft fabric, very comfortable to wear. these pants are perfect for spring, summer or fall when the weather isn\\'t too hot or too cold. i like the fit and the print. the flared leg flatters the figure and takes the focus from the back end! i may get other patterns. my grand daughter loves these pants and people are asking her where she got them, so they can get some too. very happy with purchase. i love this pants... the material feels great, it looks great and i look great in it... i ordered my size i love tahari and had to return as these were to big. they are a beautiful pant! great fit i was sooo afraid when i order these cause as they say you get what you pay for but this wasn\\'t the case at all!! i order the adventure time leggins to workout and they fit just perfect!! i adore them and the best thing? they\\'re not seethru at all and look like in the picture.. really satisfy with this purchase!! they are cheap so don\\'t expect much. they do tend to ride up into areas frequently, but otherwise exactly as expected with sizing and material.<br />arrived very quickly. very comfortable. and stretchy. i wair size 32-33 or 11/12. these fit well and could also fit smaller size people. i have these pants and i love them! as a matter of fact i am wearing them tomorrow! the fit is great, the stretch is in style and comfortable. the tuck down the middle of the pant legs is great. you can wear them to work or out to the mall. i recommend these pants to anyone who want to look stylish and be comfortable. when i ordered these, i wasn\\'t sure how good they would be, considering the price, and i figured it would take about a month to get them from the \\\\\\\\\"slow boat from china\\\\\\\\\"- literally! however, i got them within a week-straight from shaghai! and are they comfy??? yes!!!! the comfiest pair of leggings i have ever worn! the material is very stretchy and soft, and feels sleek on the skin. i am 5\\'6\\\\\\\\\", 120 pounds, and they fit me perfectly, but i think if you are smaller or larger by a few sizes, they would also fit well. i\\'m definitely getting another pair of the black, plus one red and one blue! i got my black pair from fuzzy green, but i\\'ve gotten things from intimates 21 too, and they are both good sellers, so you can\\'t lose with these... go for it! very comfortable! these are good quality pants. they are slightly thinner than i was hoping for, but are your typical yoga pant. i wlove this outfit....very trendy and different....wishing it was a little bigger than it is but all in all i love it they\\'re real nice. they fit amazingly theyre really comfy im a size medium 5\\'8 it was a bit small and short for me but i didn\\'t mind it the quality was okay not a big fan but looked amazing!!!!! got so many compliments on it! this is actually my second pair & i love them. i wore them throughout pregnancy & knew i want a 2nd pair for my csection recovery. very nice fabric....and great fit if you are short, these are great as pants. also comfortable for travel.  we\\'ll made. these are very cute. i like to keep them done up and ready to wear because they are so comfy and yet they look good enough to run to the store in. my friend who happens to be my size wants to steal them! lol they are soft fabric, they are a favorite in my wardrobe. when i received these pants i was somewhat worried when i took them out of the package because of the fabric,but when i tried them on i fell in love with them they have the look of regular jeggings that have that tight fit. i had abdominal surgery this past july and i don\\'t like wearing the tight jeggings and skinny jeans that i wore prior than then. these jeans are so comfortable and feel like pajamas i was so happy i ordered more in different colors and ordered them as christmas gifts  i will definitely be buying from this seller and recommend this seller to my friends and family slightly see through i love this style of pants but i returned the pair i bought because the color looked nothing like the photo.  this vibrant looking pair was a very dull navy blue.  the material was kind of silky, i prefer the cotton pair i already have.  debating on getting another pair in a different color. too short, and i\\'m only 5\\'5&#34;.  i did, however, love the fabric.  the pants feel heavy when you pick them up, but manage temp very well.  i wore these every three days or so after a surgery, and this time of year, where i live, it\\'s cool in the early morning and evening, and can get quite hot during the day.  this fabric would go all day with me.  the proportions of waist/hip to length could use some tweaking. the shipment was fast and i love the way it fits my body. my husband loves it. i will be buying more. i\\'m a happy customer. ☺ completely adorable and comfy ordered to wear in hospital after having baby, pleased with length i am 5\\'8 and they are plenty long! these pants are so soft and comfortable and i absolutely love the way they fit.  i got a pair for myself and my husband wanted them so i ordered a second pair a day later! i wish i could wear them everyday! the shipping was extremely fast and efficient and i live in hawaii where it usually takes twice as long as everywhere else, it took 3 days from the day i ordered them till the day i had them in my hands, both times. great quality, great price and i love the color selection. i am usually a small or petite but i ordered a medium to get that baggy fit and they are perfect, although the medium i bought for myself is slightly smaller than the medium i ordered for my husband, in my case it worked in my favor but just a note. i would recommend this product to anyone who appreciates quality and comfort! these are great!  i bought these for my daughter, along with some other goofy cat items, and she loved these.  they\\'re fun and she said they were comfy. fits perfect..snug and comfortable they are great.. so comfortable and exactly what i wanted... will define reel be getting more of these in future... perfect great fit, great quality and looks amazing! this is a very very good choice for the kind of leggins. look really nice love the fabric, super stretchy, high waisted, i  was a little unsure about ordering this, but it worked out great. i got the red one and the color is beautiful. the material is a light flexible linen, and i really like the fit. i usually wear an eight  but i ordered a 10. for me it\\'s perfect. there\\'s a tie in the back so you can make it tighter if you want. love them fit perfectly these pants are super cute. i wore them with a cut off black tee .... got tons of compliments. i ordered a medium according to some of the reviews.  i am 5\\'4&#34; and weigh 112.  they fit perfectly and have some &#34;give&#34; to them with their stretch.  pretty color and shipped in a very timely manner. love it!! i love them!!! they look amazing and fit perfectly. they are so distinctive i can\\'t wait to wear them to the dinner next week! i like the elasticity of the waistband and the length.  material is soft and comfy. this is my second purchase.  i also have the grey color. i like the cut, the fabric is good quality, they are not see through and very comfortable. it was a little long for me but i am not very tall and was expecting that. my only complaint is that it was not as long as depicted. i\\'m 5\\'9&#34; (175cm) tall and when the pants are worn at the waist they do not quite reach my ankles. very comfortable.  can wear them all day without any discomfort at all. these are so cute.! i received them in only 2 days which was great. the pattern is so cute and the material is so comfortable. they are a bit big in the waste but i just pull them up higher:3 they did have a weird plastic smell but that\\'s probably just because of how they were packaged. very good quality for such a low price. gonna check out what else these guys sell :) good absolutely fantastic. they are super comfortable and i love the pattern. would definitely buy more. i love them they are my first yoga pants and they are super comfy. i wear them to school and sometimes to sleep. the only thing for me is that the fold over part is weird but that\\'s just me cause this is my first pair. i\\'m pretty small and a teenager but they fit perfect. i also love the price, they were the cheapest ones i could find and they are wonderful. when i washed them i thought they would shrink but they are still the same. i love these so much. these are amazingly comfortable.... comfy, attractive and fits well. but better for lounging as cotton is not a quick dry/wicking product. great fit and quality.  very comfortable.  better price than big box stores. i ordered 2 sizes up based on previous ratings and because i want my palazzo pants loose fit.  i received my order in about 3 days which was great. one pair was too short because i\\'m 5\\'9/5\\'9 and the seller quickly sent me a new pair. i ordered the black coral and beige :-) the pants are very good but i wanted mixture of cotton and denim. the material feels loose. awesome. remarkably comfortable, so soft- ordered three pairs.  have received so many compliments too! love them!!! beautiful and comfy. i will be buying more! so comfy and way cute color!! but i wear a size 0 or 24 and i ordered a size small. it was a little baggy. but i still love them! i had purchased these leggings before in a store about a year ago and decided to get new ones so i looked and found the on amazon. to start off with the shipping was quick which made me very happy and the material off the leggings is so soft and comfortable. i am 5\\'4 and 110 lbs and they fit great they are stretchable and reach my ankle and bundle up a tiny bit which i like in my leggings. i would highly recommend and will buy from again. i\\'m 5\\'7\\\\\\\\\" and these fit me perfectly. they do indeed work well for yoga but i wear them day-to-day all the time. they\\'re just the right weight- not too heavy, not scratchy, not too thick but not thin, either. definitely never see-through. i have average-length legs for my height. a shorter woman, especially with shorter legs, will probably want to buy a petite in these pants. this particular style from woman within doesn\\'t shrink in length or size (unlike some of their other cotton pants). the bootcut on these makes my legs look slimmer and longer, which lord knows i always need. they hit just right on my shoes- i\\'m not walking on the pants leg in the back, but they\\'re not high-waters, either. i have several pairs of these in different colors and bought them in different years, but they\\'re always of consistent quality. they\\'re extremely forgiving to weight changes, bloating, swelling, etc. i have an hourglass shape with a smaller waist & bigger hips/legs. many pants that fit well in the waist are way to small in the legs, or vice versa. i\\'ve bought many pairs of pants (including from woman within) that fall off my tush all day long, which i can\\'t stand. these stay up, the elastic in the waist being good and strong without being constricting. they go with t-shirts, polos, turtlenecks, tunics, you name it. i live in athletic sneakers and casual shirts with no prints, so these work perfectly for me. for tall-ish women with a figure like mine and a sporty style like me, i can\\'t recommend them highly enough. my waist is a 34, i was hoping that these being as big as they are would give me a bit more room, what i found is that the belt/tie that is attached to the back is just long enough to make a know in the front (wish it was a bit longer. so even though i really like these, they are more aimed for people who are a bit more petite than me. fast delivery, product is great! they are great, they were long so i had to hem them but i love them. my new favorite yoga pants! :-) love love love them im very satisfied with this purchase, the only issue is i had to get it tailored because it was too long but besides that its a very confortable pant, exactly what i wanted. good these are very soft, comfortable, and warm.  they fit just like normal one-size leggings, but they are thicker and less see-through. these pants are very comfortable, like a t-shirt.  i can even wear them to work if i dress them up with nice shoes/shirt.  due to the simple material i do worry that the color is going to fade quickly though.  sometimes i do feel underdressed wearing them to work, but i think i can get away with it while they are brand new.<br />they are so comfortable that they could be worn to do yoga or as pajamas. these fit great but i regret buying them in the brown color. i ended up keeping them anyway but might buy another pair in a different color. love love love them and i\\'ll be back for many more in different colors! your a pro seller for sure ty ty ty ty! longer than expected but fits well in thighss and waist so comfy and cute. they fit okay...that\\'s about the best i can say. ended up donating them to a friend and she loves them excellent. great fit. thanks! great item. nice and cool on a hot day. perfect length as well. great, want another color! amazingly, these fit really well. roomy enough not to feel restricted, but flattering. i\\'m petite, so i always need to turn up the bottoms. the fabric is sturdy, heavier than i expected. i\\'m pleased with the trousers and would buy another pair in a different colour if i could be sure it was the same style number. beautiful and comfortable set! can be worn even in summer because they are light and cool. wish the sleeves were 3/4 instead of long, but still great. so cozy! love them! &#34;as expected&#34; is not really accurate, since i never expect the sizing to be correct but this time it was! can\\'t believe it...fits perfectly.  oh joy oh joy.  i haven\\'t tried them ouside yet and so don\\'t know whether or not the wind/cold protection is up to par but i will assume so, given the materials and workmanship and the original price. based on the chart given for this item- the fit was great! the material is lightweight and soft. i purchased as lounge/ pjs pants and am very pleased. i have 39&#34; hips and am 5\\'5&#34; and i purchased a large. i will be purchasing more! these are  now one of my new favorite lounge wear pants extremely comfortable. i highly recommend buying a pair for yourself very flattering.  top is stretchy enough to wear high or fold over for a low waist.  super soft and comfy. pretty cute tights, worth the money, although they\\'re a little cuter in the picture than they are in person. really warm, and a lot of people liked them, so i\\'m happy! perfect fit. i bought them for a friend she is 5\\'7 150lbs. i bought the medium. looks just like the picture. arrived a week earlier than expected. i\\'m obsessed with these jeans. i had finally had it with jeans that fit like leggings! my favorite jeans growing up and in high school were the hand me down levi\\'s i got from my brothers. i purchased these and i got that yummy feeling i had in the past. no worry of looking like i have hungry butt... a truly disgusting cheap look. i put on a linen blouse, pearls, heels & look fab. ;) comfy and cute, these are my go-to pants for overall comfort & style! just what i expected, stretchy yoga pants! they arrived earlier than i expected also. i am 5\\'6 and 140lbs, a medium fits perfect. the trousers have an elasticated waist for a confortable fit. the material is soft to the touch but thick at the same time for warmth.<br /><br />i have worn it to the store as well as an evening at the movies. very versatile. they fit really nice, i ordered the large, i am 5\\'5 and 150 lbs. love love love i purchased these jeans since i was looking for a pair that were camouflage.  they were the size and fit i expected them to be and they look great. the price was also perfect for the jeans. i could live in these -- love, love, love them.  so soft, fit perfectly. i like the pants.......but they do run small-  i returned and ordered the next size up-  hoping they are o.k.  been looking for this color....... my friend and i bought several pairs and am happy with each one. these are awesome for riding sleepers are nice and comfortable. a little on the thin side.they were not advertised as being a winter style,so no disappointment here. i would recommend them to any ladies,who want something cozy to wear. these leggings came in yesterday and they look great. they have a sort of silky finish but not too much that you are looking like a 70\\'s disco queen.  the print is fabulous.!!! i cannot wait to wear these on on my birthday weekend. great job. love these! the price wasn\\'t that reasonable especially since the material is thin but they are super comfy and it fits well. wish there were more colors! nice pull-up pants. love the fitting and color. see through but that\\'s ok. they\\'re still cute. ty i prefer the wide leg style . it makes me look a little taller i  bought these pants for my summer field class in which i did intense hiking in 100 degree temperatures and these pants were great. the pants have many accessible pockets and the material of the pants is not too thick, which is good because they don\\'t feel heavy (or you don\\'t feel too hot) when you\\'re hiking. since these pants are light/cheap in material, i don\\'t think they will last a life time, but i won\\'t mind buying them again after i trash the one\\'s i have. these are great for the price.  i was worried they wouldn\\'t fit (i\\'m 5\\'4, 126 lbs) but they were perfect.  they don\\'t look super cheap even though they are.  i hope they stand the test of time and don\\'t fall apart after two wears, but we will see. great comfy fabric and fit. not too baggy or tight. not too thick, not too thin. it did shrink and im glad it did as im 5.2&#34; and the length was just right after it shrank :). i ordered a small. i am satisfied with the purchase and i would be confident in making future purchases. i order this brand because the length is long enough. these pants are light weight and very comfy. the pockets are a good useable size. they seem to be well made. i am planning on ordering another pair! have many pairs of this style in different colors. this is a true red color fits great and they wear well. great quality.  looks and feels great.  fit was perfect.  good colors. great scrubs for the price...easy to work with...fast shipping...good quality for the money i love these pants & its a plus that they are high wasted very comfy leggings are extremely small! however the seller was great to work with for returns, so this purchase overall gets 4 stars for me! love love these pants, i\\'m 5\\'5 but even if i were 6 feet tall the pants would still be too long.. had to cut the bottom of legs so i wouldn\\'t trip or ruin them. i\\'ve actually even slept in them ! they are that comfortable . i bought 2 more pair with tribal prints ..just wish they weren\\'t so long nice look. beautiful and warm. however because i was so worried about the sizing i took the advice if going 2 sizes up. normally a small/medium but went to an xl. fits everywhere but the waist so need a belt. never mind still like them. i had to cut the pockets out because the pants are very tight and the pockets looked silly. i re-sewed them and these are one of my favorite pairs of pants now. i will be purchasing more in the near future. i like the way they fit. they\\'re so comfortable. i gave 4 stars because it says not to wash and dry, but line dry. i may try to put in the dryer. i don\\'t like to iron!! nice but a little short. i wear boots with them i saw these while christmas shopping in the mall.  one touch and i knew they were perfect for my needs.  it was an expensive christmas so i waited to purchase. i live in california.  i move around all day working with kids.  with our constantly changing weather one needs light, but insulated pants.  i needed movement and form fitting.  they fit so perfectly it is shocking.  i usually buy patagonia.  these were just so exactly the perfect pants for my needs nothing patagonia offered compared to them.  their lightness is fantastic.  i am 5\\'5&#34; tall exactly, slightly longer torso, petite legs.  i weigh around 144.  size 4 fit perfectly in length etc. and my weight is coming down so i didn\\'t want to go with a larger size.  they are sexy practical super comfortable perfectly structured pants. for cool california weather and all spring and fall weather, ideal.  ideal for camping or where there is radical change in daily climate  i would give 5 stars, but a little stitching is loose.  this may be my machine, so don\\'t judge harshly.  i live in an apartment and use our laundry facility.  just in case, since they are so easy to clean, (stretchy, pliable) wash delicate. i have a black pair.  will buy more. and now turned on to eddie bauer because of these pants. only drawback is that they are more like hip huggers than expected. but they fit nicely and i am impressed with the quality. just what i expected not as nice color wise than the pics, but still good, unfortunately too short. sent them back thou\\' mail office said there was a missing part to the mail address and it may come back to me. i won\\'t be happy if that happens as they are not cheap!!!!! super, super, soft and nice. a bit long/slender fit, but not by much. i think i may get a second pair. these are meant for lounging and sleeping and cats sitting on you because it\\'s so soft. just don\\'t play around fire, it\\'s polyester! but softer than the cotton flannel jammies! caution, read revised section - i am so pleased with this purchase. the pants are a little higher of a waist than i would have liked which is the only reason that i did not give the last star. the fabric is wonderful and the fit is amazing. i normally order a 2x and went with a 1x based on other reviews. the pants are still roomy and i wonder if i should have gone a size smaller still.  pants are cut beautifully in my opinion and the opinion of my 26 year old daughter.<br /><br />revised----------<br />i am not happy with this seller since i had the items delivered to my work and now i am receiving plus size catalogs at my work. if you buy from this seller you will be put on mailing lists! not good woman within...not good at all i love these yoga pants!! i wear these all the time. they are very stretchy and form fitting. great for not only yoga but for something to throw on when you want to be comfortable. they were heavenly the moment i put them on. nice warms buns now. that horrible cold washington weather can not get me now. thank you. very fast shipping.the pants fit perfectly.<br />i will deffinately be buying more from this company. love the selection of colors.<br />the pants are super comfortable. thin material, but soft<br />i have short legs and these fit perfectly which is nice for me.<br />snug around the torso<br />great for putting over dance/exercise closes<br />color in photo is true for grey i\\'m in love! i got a medium as i usually do with pants, and they\\'re perfect. so cute and the material in really great. i\\'m extremely satisfied! they got here really quick and i\\'m very impressed with the quality considering i didn\\'t have to pay so much. can\\'t wait to wear them :) i think the fault was mine. i ordered the small size because i am short and medium usually seems way too big because they are always too long. i should\\'ve gotten the medium and i wouldn\\'t have had to return them. but the material was so soft i almost kept them anyway. unfortunately, i work as a vet tech so my job is fairly physical and i could tell the pants would have ripped easily with too much movement. i have found scrubs that i can get away with a small, but i think these run slightly smaller. i am used to highly specialized equipment for all-season triathlon training. i find the more \\\\\\\\\"technical\\\\\\\\\"  clothing not \\\\\\\\\"right\\\\\\\\\" for my yoga training for flexibility and relaxation/mental focus. the natural and comfy feel of the egyptian combed cotton in the pants and sturdy t-shirt feels just right! i had some  remarks on sizing and sewing and the personal customer service has been extraordinary. good to know for international customers! perfect for those cold winter nights. soft, comfy, keeps your legs very warm! i originally posted a 1 star review. so...when you pull the pants out of the package, they look very, very small. unstretched the xl had a 26 inch waist. they looked to be fair quality, but i thought they were asian sizing, not us sizing. they definitely do not look like xl, but more like a small. they sat around for months and i was going to donate them to goodwill. i decided to try them on first, thinking they wouldn\\'t go over my larger rear end and big stomach. was i shocked - they easily stretch to fit perfectly - no binding around the waist and the wait is a little high to smooth out the bulges. they don\\'t stretch and sag when i wear them a couple days between washings, plus i\\'ve washed them 5 or 6 times now and they come out great. these went from the goodwill pile to my favorite pair of yoga pants. however, i think these would be too short for anyone over 5\\'5. fits perfectly. i\\'m in love with it it fit perfect in my waist. i order small and i am 16 years old girl. i love it 💗💗💗❤❤ i ordered a size larger after reading the reviews because i got some toosh. .. n there to big.  washed hoping they shrink.  will definitely buy a medium true fit for next time. absolutely  love this pants. it feels like i\\'m wearing pajamas but it looks very professional. great, comfortable pants. this pant can be used for work and for a night out on the town. i would give them 5 stars. good seller! ! ! i love it . i didn\\'t know if i should get a large or medium.. i ended up getting a medium wishing that that will be my size. i\\'m 5\\'4 160ib and it fits perfectly.. its not too tight or too losse .i can\\'t wait to take it to my gym class love these pants!!! great product! highly recommended it! very satisfied! my yoga pants arrived as scheduled and they fit perfectly. i love them!!!!<br /><br />thanks so much, now i have more than just black yoga pants. soft and cuddly, says my wife and daughter!!  washed well and the logos were bright and fun for a super hero sleepover!! love these great for working out in i\\'ll be getting more soon love the no-hem idea! these were too big for me, but i liked the color and soft thin fabric so much i returned them for a smaller pair. feel awesome but a bit big love this cup. dislike thick heavy cups.  june morrow received a very small size and label size is coming where the material cortadaron but i see very good quality but size really does not say s nowhere seems much more small material is soft, pockets are convenient, and it fits perfectly.  definitely ordering more of these. medium plush fabric, slimmish fit, bought &#34; small,&#34; for 5ft 2, 115 pounds. good price! have not yet washed them... never again will i wear bikini bottoms or anything else that shows more than i want others to see while i swim. these are perfect and come at a great price. i ordered two sizes above what i wear because i don\\'t like anything tight. i suggest going at least one size, maybe two sizes up from what you think you wear. the high waist is very comfortable and i love it. the legs fit nicely  and do not bind. the solid black color goes with all of my tankinis. high praise!!! i love these pants. too small (returned) perfect the material is very soft and smooth and super stretchy.  it was very comfortable to wear.  i usually wear a size 10-12 and i ordered the large size and it was perfect. the only main issue was, the seat was a bit small and it does not hold the bottoms firm like typical yoga pants.  i had to wear a control underwear.  but the designs are so pretty and i ordered various colors, especially since it was around $10 each when i ordered them. these pants are now my favorite!  they are incredibly comfortable, light, airy and they fit tight enough around my waist. i\\'m very short and they even fit my height! overall, i love. so comfortable , the pants are great quality the fabric is so easy to take care . these pants are very comfortable, but also very clingy.  i only wear them around the house. good product. i was looking for a pair of &#34;dressy&#34; orange slacks!  these fit the bill 100%, great fit, love the fabric, the color is orange and not some faded peach color.  i can\\'t wait to wear them! i\\'m a curvy lady, and these fit everything perfectly! they do stretch around the butt and show through but who in their right mind wears leggings as pants anyway? these look great underneath a black skirt with my military boots! so soft and the pattern is really awesome! i like them, though i bought them too small. need to buy much bigger than my usual 1x or xl in regular stretchy pants in order for them to be comfortable. was exactly what i expected! super cute. great fit. i wore these pants to zumba class and received many compliments. i wear a size 8 and i ordered the medium. very pleased with this purchased. these are so cute! lets see how they hold up on the slopes (as far as keeping me dry) also im 5\\'5&#34; 125-130 lbs and the xl or xxl fit fine the fit is perfect and that was really up in the air for me since i hadn\\'t bought a pair of pants in over 10 years so i wasn\\'t sure of my size. i used the size chart and it fit as it should have, if only a little short. i\\'m 5ft 8in and the pants fell short of my ankles by about three inches so if you\\'re shorter than than, this pants is for you! kind of an awkward length for me. i got around it by adding a bit of fabric to the hem but it\\'s stretchy enough that you might want to fold it up a few times if you like.<br /><br />all in all, i\\'m happy! very comfortable but a little tight through the hips. i wear size 16. these were a little big but like the roominess for comfort. love all the pockets. will probably order again. awesome these are great! but i ordered a size up due to reviews and i wish i had just ordered my regular size because i\\'m sure they will stretch out a bit and not fit tight in a short while. material is thin but not really see through. i was told yoga pants were great for pregnancy, and found that to be correct.  the pants were a little tighter than most sweatpants, but they still fit and the length was perfect (i am 5 feet 5 inches tall). for the price, these capris can\\'t be beat...love the pockets and how light weight they are these arrived in less then a week from india to california.  they are beautiful and very soft.  i love the double sided fabrics are how complementary they are to the opposite side.<br /><br />there was some loose fibers that needed to be trimmed.  they all had a faint incense or spice odor that i am sensitive to so i had to put them all in the wash. note:  i received a free sample of these tights for review.<br /><br />i practice yoga, although i tend to shy away from more form-fitting pants:  although my weight is average, i hold a lot of it in my hips, buttocks, and thighs.  however, i thought i would take a chance that these tights might work for me.<br /><br />the first thing i liked about these tights is the fabric, as the polyester/spandex blend is super-soft!  they are also very comfortable to wear, containing just the right amount of stretch without being too clingy.  i also really like the color/pattern.  i chose #5, which was the black and white one (the others were a little too bright for me).  this pattern was actually very flattering--even my husband said that it made my legs look thinner!<br /><br />my only complaint about these tights is that i wish that the waistband had been a bit more substantial.  the fabric is doubled at the waist, but there is no extra elastic or anything else.  i think most women--even those of us of average weight--want a bit of extra hold in this area.  otherwise, however, i am happy with these tights and have already worn them to a day-long yoga training, where they performed well. i usually wear a size 6-8 but after the reviews i ordered these pants in a large and they fit me perfectly. they were delivered within 2 weeks of the order. a little boxy in appearance when you wear them but they are great for office. love them aaaaa+ i bought these because i had a coupon that was about to expire, and i didn\\'t really need anything else. so it was a nice surprise when they arrived, and i tried them on, and they turned out to be very comfortable. they must be true to size because they do not creep up, and they do not dig into my skin. if i see them when i open the underwear drawer, there is no hesitation - i will wear these. great looking and lightweight! some reviews online made me hesitant on buying this item but when i received it i was so in love!<br />great quality!!!<br />they are very small but fit me perfectly. if you are not a size xsmall or small do no buy. other than that the item was fantastic and even came with a cute note for valentines day!.<br />love love love! perfect. awesome and actually long enough for me. i\\'m nearly 6 ft tall and these are long enough and very comfy. highly recommend. these pants are great for a warm evening. they are thin. i really like them but be sure you order at least 2 sizes smaller beautiful my daughter loves them gave this to my gf as a gift and she loved it. she\\'s skinny with curves so as far as fit it was great, a bit too long for her but she just folded the bottom. nice and comfortable 😊 works as expected i loved these shorts and used them for spinning class. they are very comfortable and i would recommend these to everyone. they run big, so i would suggest getting a smaller size, if you prefer a fitted fit. these are as i expected; however, they come unhemmed.  usually have to shorten my pants anyway so for me it was not a problem. wool is a bit prickly but i\\'m hoping it softens with a few washings. one of my favorites! awesome! goes with everything comfy well made love them wasn\\'t exactly what i was looking for but the product itself was great, the maroon is vibrant and definitely stands out. comfortable and fit great. didn\\'t expect the leg pocket but that was a nice surprise i dont like the material, but for the price its ok. love this leggings 😁👍🏽 too samll. gave them to a neighbor. these are pants are the best yet!    the camo is really dark and authentic and the colour did not run or fade when i ran it through the washer. i will see how this turns out in future.     the pants were a trifle long (i am 5 4\\') but i can live with that..and the strings that you tie around your ankles help alot!     i think the sizes run abit big. i would normally wear large but the medium ones were perfect. i ordered the petite, and it was a few inches longer than my other koi lindsey pxs pants! i took a chance in purchasing this pants, and when i received it i was very happy i did, it\\'s a perfect fit not to tight or slack, what also impressed me was the quality felt really thick and durable........i am going to purchase more patterns for sure these jean fit great!!! i am 5\\' 7&#34; and sometimes jeans just aren\\'t long enough but these are awesome!!! i love them ! i ordered a size 27 and they came as a size 4 they\\'re a little tight on my rump, but otherwise they fit perfect and look exactly how i thought they would! they\\'re not stretchy but i still love them! the price is great too. i love these pants! i am an rn and weekend supervisor. i work 16 to 18 hour shifts, so i have to have scrubs that are comfortable and durable. the pockets hold all my gear and keep it in place while i\\'m running, walking, bending, crouching, and sitting. i am 5\\'9&#34; and 115lbs. i ordered the small tall size, and unfortunately, too big. i am able to tie the waist pretty snugly, so they still work for me. they are too big through no fault of the seller, i just ordered the wrong size. i have since ordered the x-small tall, and they just arrived yesterday, again, sooner than expected and in perfect condition with tags on and all that. i tried them on immediately and again, too big! lol, maybe i should put on a couple pounds... anyway, these do not shrink in the wash, i tried twice. washed on the sanitize option on my washer and dried on sanitize. didn\\'t fade or shrink at all. i iron everything, but these really do not need it. they always come out wrinkle free. the material is lightweight but not cheap. these are perfect for anyone who needs a lot of room for their equipment. i will order more of these in different colors. :) cute perfe perfect fit these pants are beautiful !! they fit perfectly and they look gorgeous on me i can dance in them and wear them around the house if i want they are sooooo comfy i love them ! and the shopping was really fast came in about 3-4 days the pants are very comfortable and soft to the touch. you can do just about what ever in these pants. i would love to get another pair in another color. the r nice fit look gd on i will be ordering the other colors of this cuz they are very comfy.. and they have my size thats a plus very comfortable and easy care. these are my favorite pants.  they are warm, never need ironing, just wash and dry.  i have several pairs.    i wear them everyday during the winter. i am a u.s. size 3, 5\\'4&#34;, 120lbs, and these fit perfect; therefore, ladies of size 5 and beyond may find these too small. i plan to reinforce the seams, as the pants are sewn with fairly wide stitching that doesn\\'t look like it will hold up, thus the reason for my 4 star review. the pattern is just as shown and the colors are vibrant. as a black milk aurora sky legging knock off, i was very pleased with this inexpensive version. they arrived on my door step ahead of schedule. fun colorful and comfortable stunning! they look great and told all my friends...they said, great price! product is as described, very comfortable this pants is great and colorful, for a very cold house, this pants could be a little too light and you could be cold but in my high rise with a quite good inside temperature, the pants is perfect. the cotton is very soft and this is very great to wear it, the length is perfect, i was delighted to purchase this item! the fit is a little tight but not enough to send them back.  i am sure they will be ok after wearing them a few times.  hope i will lose some  weight.  i will get more when i see how they wash and dry.  they look very good on. i have had 3 pairs and wear them everyday to work. i have never had any problems and they don\\'t shrink or fade to badly like the fit real well. comfy and cute! good [[videoid:3c3ca659bc2bc76a5e5f2bdbb3359415]]this review is for the just love women\\'s black scrub pant - extra large.<br /><br />i love these xl scrub pants from just love! i am a size 14/16 and i am 5\\'8 in height and they fit me perfectly! the waist features high quality elastic and easily pulls up and down when putting them on or taking them off for the night. they are super comfortable to bend and twist during my shift at the hospital with patients. the best part is the length. i am 5\\'8 and need really long legs! these legs must be approx a 33 inch inseam as they do not flood on me and actually cover my ankles and tops of shoes! i love that because it is extremely hard for me to find pants that are the perfect length.<br /><br />the pants are super soft and the material washes well and steams well. i am a nut and always steam my scrubs after every wash. i like to look professional and wrinkle free on the hospital floor with patients; it gives them a better impression. i always hang dry my garments also, so if you plan to put these in the dryer i am not 100% sure on their outcome for you with shrinkage, but i know these do not shrink when you machine wash cold and air dry.<br /><br />i also love these pants as the pockets are well placed. there is a side pocket that fits my stethoscope perfectly. it is deep enough that my steth has no worry of dropping out. the top has two slant pockets and i carry my personal items in their depths. (tampons, pads, and cash). these pants are slightly baggy but provide enough shape that they aren\\'t too casual looking. very nice black color goes with all the scrub tops i own also.<br /><br />5/5 stars for materials, design and functionality.<br /><br />if you have any questions please post below and i would be happy to answer! i received a free promotional sample of this item for my honest and unbiased review. i bought mine from costco several months ago and they are my &#34;go to&#34; pants! the fit is perfect! they don\\'t slide down at the waist. the length is long enough to fall on the top of my foot, which i like. i am 5\\'-10&#34;. they have not faded in the laundry like most blacks. most importantly they are comfortable beyond belief. cool in the summer, i live in arizona, and warm in the winter, arizona winter ;-). i don\\'t recommend things lightly but these are super fantastic! get at least 2 pair! seriously, you will like them that much. to calvin klein, could you make them in a stone washed light faux denim? please! the stepdaughter adores these.  the colors are vibrant and the pants are super comfy.  i bought several more. just ordered these to wear during my lyra classes (aerial hoop) and they are great. they fit snuggly and stretch perfectly. they are thick enough to not look see through when you bend over like other leggings. i got the pink cosmo and the print is very pretty and vibrant. they came way faster than estimated too. i will be ordering several more pairs! the pants are great for someone that has wide legs.  these pants fit nicely and they don\\'t bind my legs.  i wish they made them in more colors than just navy blue and black.  i\\'d buy a pair in every color if they did.  the fabric is a nice quality and they lay nicely.  the company was great about getting the product to me in a timely manner. i feel like these were a gift they are so cheap and the quality is amazing!! hip, great fit, light as air. the perfect pant for summer. great trousers but not exactly white. the colour is a little toned down and its almost cream colour. but very lovely. i ordered the size i normally wear and should have ordered a size smaller, first off these of some of the most comfortable pants ive ever worn! however, i found that because it is jersey fabric it stretches a lot, so when im wearing them they almost fall off. im going to order more in other colors but make sure to get them smaller. fit snugly, exactly as described, comfortable comfy!!! very soft and comfy, lots of compliments was a very comfortable fit. not tight. needs a belt if you don\\'t like the elastic look in the back. love the material they feel very comfortable i used to walk 2 to 4 miles on week days and have no discomfort with them at all these pants are meant to be large. ties well (with the right knots!) and does well for climbing. very free movement! so soft!!! material was a bit see through though and very long the fabric is a wee bit more flimsy than i expected and the pants were longer than i thought they would be, having selected &#34;petite&#34; but the color is perfect and exactly what i hoped, seeing the seller\\'s picture. i purchased for my mother as a gift.  the fit/feel was great, washing up fine. i bought this as a gift for one of my daughters my girlfriend love it, and it was delivered on time true to size measurements and decent quality. perfect thanks these are nice pants. good solid material and they fit well. the fabric is a little stiff, but it\\'s ok. i don\\'t blame them for not fitting i\\'m pretty tall. but i think they are better for much shorter people. i thought they would look dressier in love with these pants. i do not like polyester/spandex clothing.......i don\\'t like the feel on my skin, and in a steamy climate of s. florida; you are asking to be miserable....that being said; these feel like silk - they are heavenly light and soft.  i am very hippy, with a bubble butt, and these manage to make me look tall, thin, and do not highlight any cellulite dimples (as feared with such thin fabric).  i purchased the dark blue with brown print.  i am 5\\'5\\'&#34;, and always in platform shoes, thus only had to trim off about 2&#34; of the hem (which did not interfere with the bottom print).<br />they arrived quickly - i plan on purchasing more. beautiful and vibrant color. i wanted to try something different. great fit sometimes i need an extra large and i had to work my weighted sports hoop for a week to work off the post holiday weight because when it arrived it was snug ang the thin material shows every thing but the design is nice and i feel sexy in these. i am tall and they are not short on me but just right. the stripe is very pretty and prehaps why these are expensive. they are sew well and i wore them with boots in this cool florida winter weather. the product delivered on time, it fits well and is comfortable, the legs where a bit long but easly repaired. i am happy with the product. i ordered one size up and it was a perfect fit. over all i am satisfied. i like these, they aren\\'t the best quality,basically they are thick leggings you may or may not want to pull off as &#34;pants&#34; but love the color, they fit true to size, and came on time.. bought it as a gift, loved how it looked on her, great spring colors, would buy more if they had other colors just received them and love them, i am 5\\' 7&#34; 128lbs and they fit perfectly with just the right amount of funk! love the neoprene shorts, they really let you sweat. love every pair these are great yoga pants! so comfortable and definately slimming. i wish they had more colors for the legs, instead of gray and black! love it these pants are wonderful and stylish. i am a size 12 and they fit wonderfully. i like the tight waistband and it pulls you in a little. i would definitely recommend the purchase of these pants. love them!!! good quality she loves em. they fit great, slide over other clothing nicely and are fantastic wind breakers. don\\'t know how they will do against the rain yet but we are very satisfied so far. i love them! they are very comfortable i\\'ll probably order another pair. exactly as described, thin material, but comfortable and stylish. the drawsting is the best one i have ever encountered.  i normally don\\'t like drawstings cuz they cut into my waist when i move around.  this one is obviously also organic and stretches and is comfy.  these pants are long if you are short.  lol i bought it for my yoga class. it fits me as expected and i feel comfortable when wearing it practicing yoga. i sent them to my daughter in college...she loves them cute cozy lounge pants😊 fits and looks great just like the model. i just love it. no complaints except it took over two months to receive it, not okay. size was little snug and the fabric shrunk because of pure cotton material after the first wash. need to order a larger size than your usual size to be on the safer side. but for this reason, i really like it. great! i really like this scrub. i\\'ve been working as a nurse and i tried all different types of scrubs. first of all, it is really comfortable and has a good stretch. all my other scrubs does not have a good fit and it is not that comfortable but this one fits perfect and feels so comfortable. this scrub gives me a good range of motion so it allows me to move comfortably. second, this price is really affordable. i used to pay much more for one scrub and the quality wasn\\'t that good. however, this one is really good deal with a good quality!! it is very sexy. i like the pants very comfortable i wear these leggings to work and always get complimented on how nice i look. i’m so pleased with this purchase. i would like to recommend this for sure. i love these pants!  they accomodate my waist, are very slenderizing and incredibly comfortable!  the color in the picture isn\\'t quite accurate--it is more of a rusty pink.  but i like it.  for anyone wondering about what size goes with what body, i am about 175 lbs and 5\\'5&#34;.  i ordered a large and it is perfect.  i did have to cut 3.5 inches off because i have short legs.  but, hey, it\\'s no problem to simply cut the bottoms of these pants--carefully, of course. love it! love it i\\'m 5\\' 4&#34; 135-140lbs, and the mediums fit great and can be adjusted for heels or flats. exactly what i wanted! i\\'ve been buying these for about 2 years now. i will never wear any other leggings! they fit great and aren\\'t see through at all so you can wear them as pants. the only thing i don\\'t love about them is that they don\\'t hold up very well. if your thighs rub at all like mine do, you will inevitably wear holes through them. i love my belt. it is something different and it fits different sizes so as an adult i can wear it! i love the feel and the look. i can wear them but they are smaller than a large normally fits me. so soft and amazing feeling! great item nice yoga pants. it is very comfortable. absolutely lovely pants, especially for winter! i got them sooner than expected and i love them. they\\'re very soft and comfortable to wear, and they fit me perfectly! i\\'m 5\\'7&#34; ~140 lbs. they\\'re snug as leggings should be without being too tight. they could also easily fit someone smaller/bigger than me because of the spandex material. they are very sharp and look good, my only problem is that they\\'re kind of baggy especially around the ankles (and i don\\'t even have thin legs) so i wouldn\\'t recommend them to people with thin legs unless you want baggy leggings. repeat buyer good padding and very comfortable however, they seem to run a little on the &#34;larger&#34; side. you may find that the next size down would fit you perfectly. love them, fits perfect and extremely comfortable!! they arrived within a month, which was reasonable, considering i ordered on december 23rd, and they had to travel from shanghai to detroit. very beautiful, with vibrant colours; i call them my dexter pants.<br />my only complaint is that they\\'re a little too tight in the waist-- virtually every pair of leggings i\\'ve bought on amazon has been. i\\'m not a large person by any definition; i am 5\\'6&#34;/1.67m and 125 lb./56 kg. the  top can be stretched a little bit, but they are designed for petite women or young teenagers. fit nice and feel nice and soft. not bad for the price wow--only fifteen dollars, and the size five is fits perfectly, i would definitely recommend these and they are going fast.  i was kind of panicked after i bought them, because i noticed that the details read that the pants are polyester--that is not true!! they are cotton, and the fabric is high quality and super soft.  so happy i accidentally found these! love them should of ordered more.. i am 5\\'11&#34; and 170 pounds.  i am normally a size 12, and i ordered these in size large.  they are long enough and fit great.  they are a thin material, and they softened quite a bit after washing.  i am very pleased with these lounge pants. decent pants for the price - i bought several pairs and wear them daily and have not got holes in them yet... the pairs i purchased from kohls got holes in them within the first few weeks of owning them. love my uniforms, fits perfect!! item was much better than expected! so cute and comfy!! i have worn these pants in size xl, large, and now in medium as i have lost weight. these are my go-to yoga pants...<br /><br />note the inseam measurement. they are indeed 30&#34; inseam which is perfect for me. very cool .. retro .. just a bit snug for the size... love them i bought these pants for my niece, it fits well, material as described, such as she wanted to...item delivered on time, good purchase, i recommend it nice, i like the fold down waist love love love ! i thought it wouldn\\'t be as great as the models becasue the bad reviews but it\\'s perfect !! my daughter walks a lot.  i wanted her to have nice fit pair of pants to walk in. too small very nice pants. fit as normal medium. nice but too long i love my palazzo pants! 😀 they git perfect an exactly what i wanted!! i love shopping on amazon !! they are the best an i always get exactly what i want! i\\' never disappointed an never worry about purchasing through  them. i would so much love to buy some of these!!! i work hard ...these are way too expensive...please offer a more reasonable price and i promise to buy at least 4 prs!!!! love these pants they fit well! the pants fit great are very comfortable and came in a timely fashion. thank you who doesn\\'t love yoga pants! they are a tight fit and very good quality! i really enjoy them! they are the perfect length for me and i am 5\\'3 these pants are super comfy, very fashionable and great for travel! i get a lot of compliments when i wear them. love these pants i got them for a costume mardi gras ball in new orleans. i ordered a medium and am usually a small or medium. they fit comfortable with room to dance in! i had some purple pants like this before (different company and make so these might be a little different) and they did fade over time so i am not going to dry this pair and i will wash them on the delicate cycle to try and preserve the shine. christmas present for my sister--she loves them! they are comfortable, and she uses them to work out. although the leg is too long, that is not unexpected--we are a short bunch. possibly part hobbit. very comfotable.. and fabric is excellent.. large i like this brand so i knew what i was ordering.  like the fit and the color goes well with my top.  would recommend the koi brand in petite for short legs.  fit well. glad i read the reviews for sizing! i am usually an xs-s or a 0-2. i ordered m and they are perfect. i own two pairs of these pants, one in black and one in olive drab, and i love them. i do a lot of backpacking and hiking and i wear them a lot because i like baggier clothes that give me room to stretch and move around. (any hiker that has tried to bring their foot to their hip in order to climb over something while wearing jeans can tell you that loose clothing is a must). i also wear them to lounge around the house in because they really are that comfortable. i\\'ve had them for over a year now, washed them quite a bit, and they\\'re holding up just fine.   i gave them four stars because of the sizing. i\\'m a size four and i wear an extra small and i still have to tighten the drawstring quite a bit. for women much smaller than me, these pants just wouldn\\'t work. i\\'m also 5\\'4 and they\\'re fairly long on my legs. of course, when i wear boots, i just blouse them so it isn\\'t a problem, but i do step on the edges if i\\'m walking barefoot around the house. this is just something to keep in mind when you\\'re buying them, though very few people actually buy cargo pants for a fitted look, for some people they still might be too baggy. length is way to long this was a good buy for me! i ve already gotten many compliments and ive only worn them once. these pants are colorful and comfy they also have a nice big pocket for your phone. its big too so any phone should fit. nice fabric and comfortable fit!!  i was hoping the xl would be way too big!!!  but they are just really comfortable....not as tight as i was thinking they should be to hold me together better!!!  they are really a nice quality...the nicest i\\'ve seen!!  thank you!! although i did not receive the zig zag design i was supposed to, i received a completely different design with a tribal looking one instead and lots of colors. but i absolutely love them! they fit amazing! i\\'m 5\\'7 and usually around 130 (pregnant now) and they are just the right length, you may have to readjust from wearing them and them sliding down to be a bit too long but other than that they\\'re great! beautiful lined dressy slacks that are perfect length which is a problem i have with buying pants anywhere because i\\'m short. these pants are sooooo comfortable!! i really like them i have 2 pair. i\\'m short and use them for belly dance. i bought them to fit but i have since shrunk after having a baby. my black ones are too short and my gray ones are too long. but that was after washing. thank you! i love it.  the material is really nice. i bought more. i\\'m a &#34;medium&#34; or more specifically a size 5 and these fit me nicely. i do feel a little bit of \\'squeeze\\' around my waist but it isn\\'t anymore uncomfortable than wearing a belt. obviously these have to stretch to fit me and they aren\\'t see through at all when i have them on. i get a lot of compliments. i am 5ft 8in and weigh about 155 these fit nicely, the images do stretch out and look a bit faded b/c of it but its not very noticable. the only thing i don\\'t like is that the back of the tights don\\'t line up exactly. to me it looks weird but i like things to be cemetrical.  mine are more off than the pic, just a heads up. i liked it but i feel like i am short for the pants and they drag on the floor unless i am wearing heels. if you are tall and/or wearing heels, you\\'re set! it fits perfectly and i got a large, so not too tight or not too saggy. fits pretty well, if you have booty go a size bigger.  pretty good quality for price. i am very pleased with the alfred dunner petite pants - size 10p.<br />i am 4\\'11&#34; and the petite was a perfect fit.  didn\\'t even have to hem them.<br />i have worn alfred dunner clothes for quite a while and was really glad when i found<br />them on your website.  they wear well and wash well.  very little ironing - i use my<br />hand held steamer and it does great. these run a little small. i am normally a size 6 and the small were snug, i can still get them on, but it\\'s snug. excelente! i ordered it a size bigger and fits great! i have been working out consistently for about 3 years now and am always on the hunt for great looking and comfortable work out pants. these pants are by far my number one choice. they are stylish, comfortable and supportive. they have a support panel that is slimming yet not confining. there is also a secret zip pocket to put a key, credit card, phone etc in if you choose. i\\'m only 5 feet tall so it is sometimes also hard for me to find pants that are a good length on me and these are perfect.<br /><br />the best part about these pants though is that i wear them outside the gym as well. they look amazing with a sweater and boots! they don\\'t look like gym pants and again are stylish and slimming. i stumbled upon devigi as a vendor at an event and after wearing the pair i bought there, i bought 3 more pairs within a week. worth the money! very comfortable and good quality! i recommend these and the seller....this is my 2nd pair! would like to see in different colors to. great product fit great, good quality, fast delivery.  thanks!aaaaaaa+++++ love soft, comfortable, fit perfectly, 100% opaque<br /><br />i wish i had sheets made out of this material!<br />i\\'m only 5\\'4&#34; and the leggings are very long so i have to wear them high-waisted to prevent wrinkly legs, but they\\'re fantastic. love them! ordered large and i\\'m a medium to a large, perfect this item was for my daughter. she didn\\'t like the buttons, but did like the capri\\'s. she hid the buttons with her boots. quality is excellent, much higher quality than expected, and fit is stylish. they fit just right another pair in a different color would be great to have. like these they are true to size just wish i could find them in a dark brown and maybe a lighter material. they are very soft and comfortable! pleasantly surprised. nice pants for 10 bucks. i was a little leary about how these pants were going to fit, but once i tried them on at home, i was pleasantly surprised. they are very comfortable and are made of a light, almost silky material that feels great on your skin. they arrived in great condition within a few days and i was very happy. i bought these for my daughter for christmas and she absolutely loves them.  she says they are very comfortable. amazing ! so comfortable! super cute and super soft! i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; 145lbs they\\'re a little snug around the waist. arrived earlier than expected, overall very happy! pants actually arrived yesterday, while i was out ! my mom loves them! these are her4th pair! the color & design are as pictured, well made! these come hemmed. my mom is short ,but we fold down the waist and pull up! so, later if hem becomes soiled ,we have some material to cut off and hem again! very happy with these! i\\'m sure she will get compliments when she wears these also! great pant lots of compliments based on the dimensions that were given with these, i thought they would be to big. i really, really liked them so i took the chance and i\\'m glad i did because they fit perfectly. my waist is about 28 and the listing said 32&#34; waist so i was hesitant. perfect fit (as usual for alfred dunner).  excellent quality, wonderful material, not a scratchy polyester.  always look neat.  this color red is to die for. love them asian size as expected. a repeated order for me. i bought a m-size and also an x-size. they are thin, good for the summer.  cheap pants for housework at home. these leggings are truly unique!  made for the rockerish sorts and types... :-)  item arrived very quickly, due to the free trial of amazon prime i am trying out.  the only (qualm) i have is that the leggings are not as shiny as pictured here, they are more of a muddled colour.  overall, tremendously pleased! i absolutely love these tights. they wasn\\'t too small they fit just right. this is the first product i have ever ordered online that actually fit like a glove. i will be ordering more in different colors. i don\\'t understand how these reviews can vary so much...but i love these leggings as they are thicker, well made, and super comfortable. they feel more &#34;tailored&#34; than your average leggings, are not see through, and are really really black. the waist band is not tight, maybe loose, but it makes them extra comfy. i could see some problems with a higher intensity workout i guess. great service. love this brand so soft and comfy! i love how they fit! very comfortable... and they look great. good price too! i\\'m 5\\'2&#34;, 116 lbs. these fit great. they are a shiny material. if you read the reviews you\\'ll see that they all say size up at least two sizes i did and i love the pants. i am 5\\'7&#34; 135lbs and i wear a size 4 (for reference old navy jeans). i ordered the l/xl and i can fit jeans under them comfortably. i chose the black ones because they were &#34;prime&#34; and i didn\\'t want to take the chance of having to wait or return like the other reviews said. but now knowing the fit i will probably order another pair to have a fun color on hand. if i were not going to wear layers underneath or say just tights i might think about getting the medium (although i\\'m not sure if the length would be the same). one last thing, the pants do fit over my sorrels and artic muck boots. they fit great, unlike a pair or jeans i ordered elsewhere, which were pure trash. these jeans are made to fit me great, thanks i love these leggings! i wish i could order a size though. when i opened the package i immediately wore them for going out and they are very nice. fits great on the legs but a tad loose around the hips. although, i am 5\\'2 and 100 pounds. so anyone with more body than me, this will fit perfect. with my size, i had to keep pulling them up. but these are great for outfits and costumes! great. nice and flowy and stretchy, perfect for exercise, lounging, or running errands. was in need of some capri length leggings, jeggings, etc. and hoped to find something with a little embellishment.  these are perfect!  fit, style,quality are all great.  very pleased! it looks great!  love it. i will be ordering others :)<br />timely delivery also.<br />great material no seeing true my under wares in the gym.  my daughter\\'s 19 and 21 also love it. i\\'m only 5\\'4\\\\\\\\\" and these pants are perfect!  not too long and soooooo comfy.  not too tight, hang just right, soft, and i love happy bunny stuff, and this one doesn\\'t have a specific saying so i can wear any top with \\'em.  of course, i\\'ve only worn them to bed so far, but i\\'m pregnant, too and these are gonna be comfortable to wear the whole time, i can tell. i bought these to wear around the house and for casual outings during my pregnancy.  the material is very light and breathable, which is excellent because it\\'s summer in phoenix and very hot! the downside is this does make them rather see through, but with a nice, long maternity top it\\'s nothing to worry about.  at first, these fit perfect, almost a little snug, just below my baby belly at 26 weeks.  but after wearing them around for a few hours they stretched out a lot and wouldn\\'t stay up.  one final note, the tag instructions say these are &#34;hand wash only.&#34; i doubt i\\'ll be doing that, and will re-review once i\\'ve thrown these through the wash to see how they hold up. these are great!  i have ordered other pairs of these leggings, and these are the same great quality fabric; very soft, not too heavy, but not see through at all.  the waist is actually a piece of very heavy elastic, which i was not expecting.  when i took it out of the package my first thought was &#34;this will either be very good, or very bad for my muffin top&#34;  but i was pleasantly surprised.  it sucks my stomach in well without creating new lumps and bumps.  i wear about a size 8, and think these would fit probably about a smaller size 12 comfortably.  i am about 5\\'7&#34;, and the length is just about perfect, so they could certainly be too long for some, but would probably tuck under well enough. comfortable i usually wear a small or extra small, but ordered a medium in these & they fit well for the harem style. colors are vibrant & material is a stretch rating jersey; very comfy. great very good and fit , very comfortable ! these are actually true to size and i love the fit & fabric 10/10 will order again! great quality. super comfy. these are very comfortable very cute and comfy. love them!!!! look great on me! i love fishermen pants<br />have ordered several pairs fit better than expected for one-size-fit-all garment. i am size 0 petite. love this pant!! this is my second mopas legging. the first one had a slightly heaver fleece lining which was great for winter. this one is lighter and great for now. i sleep in them! these yoga shorts are so cute and so comfortable. i did my workout in them over the weekend and i absolutely love them. like other yoga shorts, they stretch, they breath, they\\'re short. the band green band is colorful and catches the eye. the construction is solid. there\\'s nothing to complain about. i love them.<br /><br />this product was provided for review by the bizark. love them i love these pants. they look good enough to go out for dinner with nice sandals and accessories. the colors are very clear and bright. washed them once, and so far so good. hope they last a long time.  i\\'m petite, short and the length is just right. very nice product but the sizes run small but if you take this into consideration then they are great love these leggings.  they are super soft and thick, so you don\\'t feel like your butt is showing.  the fabric is stretchy and forgiving, but without feeling like the pants are going to fall down.  i\\'m in my third trimester and wish i\\'d found these much earlier. really great quality material! im more then happy, expected some cheap cotton, but this is really nice. im 5\\'9 and they are barely long enough, but its fine. you can adjust the length if you are shorther person, i wouldnt buy it if you are taller then 5\\'9. excellent i have never wrote a review before but these jeans are great!!! i am usually a size 16/18 depending on material so i order a size 18 to be on the safe side and they fit perfect. they are so comfy and look great! i could go down a size if i want them tight. but hope this helps =) i was worried they would be too short cuz i\\'m six foot. but they fit perfectly.i loves them. so comfy not too large, just too long; i will have to hem them....but worth the price. true to size, nice ankle length.  i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; and ordered a medium. easy to work out in. love these pants. this is my 2nd pair. i love the pajamas, they fit perfectly and i think i am going to order another set i like them just that much! love these pants! they are sooooo comfortable! love the quality and feel. the pants are a little tight. very nice rayon lounge pants.  great alternative to sweats.  however, one size would not fit all...!  i am a 32x34 in levis.  this fits, but would not if it were 1 pound heavier.  so hand washing and hanging to dry is in order, but worth it for the style and comfort. i love these jeans! when they first came it was the wrong order but i contacted the company and we resolved to problem immediately. when the correct order came the jeans were a tad to big but still they were extremely comfortable and cute! i love them! i will be getting a pair in a smaller size! i would defiantly recommend theses to anyone and everyone, especially if you are curvy or full figured these are great! i have been in the nursing profession for 15 years and i must say that no other scrub brands can compete with greys anatomy scrubs. they fit well and are true to size, unlike other scrubs that require you to constantly pull up the waist. they are amazingly comfortable and durable and even stylish. i just wish that the style i love had more pockets, but this definitely will not stop me from buying these scrubs! i got these for my 16 year old daughter for christmas. apparently high waisted pants are on trend. i have to admit they looked fantastic on her. she paired them with boots, a camisole and a jacket and looked like a million bucks. i would buy more if other colors/prints were available. well made and a good value on amazon! very nice fit, and nice for dressy casual. i heard about these from my mother so i bought them to try out.  i was totally blown away with the comfort and how soft the material felt.  these jeans are just wonderful. like the pants, the length is good, thought it would be tighter rather than like a bell bottom good basic addition to work and casual wardrobe...i\\'ll be ordering more. good quality ... so comfortable.  i got the impression that they might run small and ordered a size larger.  i probably didn\\'t really have to do that.  my regular size would have been fine ... a size larger is just fine too.  at this price i\\'d like to order one in each color.  i really like these yoga pants. i am 5\\'2&#34;, 125lbs.  i ordered these pants in a small and they fit great.  they do stretch a bit as you wear them and then shrink again when washed and dried.  they are super comfy, stretchy in every direction, and not so thin that you can see through them.  i have them in the solid black and also in the black and white flower design (the flower design has faded quite a bit).  because the top is a very soft wide waistband, they should fit a variety of heights.  i wear them with the waist band folded over and they touch the ground around my ankles, but aren\\'t ridiculously long.  i had a girlfriend unexpectedly stay over who is quite a bit (several inches) taller than me and she borrowed a pair to wear to bed, and with the waist band not folded over they fit her as well.  if i could afford it right now, i\\'d buy these in every color they are available.  they are my go-to comfy pants. these soft and supple pants are my new favorites. they arrived on date promised ready to enjoy. i\\'ll be using this seller again. super cool! i feel like they\\'re my oompaloompa pants. super fun & go with all tops! i love them! i have a hard time taking them off. they are very comfortable, they stretch nicely, nice color. i have a toddler that always wipes her hands on me. so these pants are awesome you can\\'t see any stains or dirt. the fit is perfect except the for the length. not as long as i expected. i will keep them and wear them as capris. these run large  i wanted a snug fit so i ordered a small i wear a medium but the small was way to baggy and i really wanted these pants been looking for a long time for capris that have large zipper pockets was so excited when i found these  i don\\'t like to carry a purse when on vacation well maybe i can find a seamtress to take them in cause i really love them i am 5feet 3 inches and weigh 130 pounds just to let you know they are very baggy on me but you may like that i prefer a more fitted pant i will order the petite in small the measurments for that are smaller i will try i do love them they are just what i have been looking for hope you have better luck i don\\'t know why they don\\'t have extra small i will contact seller on this matter and see what happens i do like these pants and will order another pair in navy.  since they are clingy around the hips and the material thin, the panty lines show as well as any \\'ripples\\' you may have.  i plan on wearing mine with a longer tee shirt or blouse.  don\\'t think that will be a problem with a darker color. i am 5\\'5&#34; and 120lbs - length is perfect for flats. they fit comfortably expected delivery day was between 9/20-9/26 bit they arrived today which made me very happy! packaged in a very nice and professional way and came with a free nail file. i saw reviews that they were smaller than expected so i got a large...much too big i wish i would have just gotten medium. i might return them but that depends if i\\'m able to free up the resources to do that, if not ill probably give them to my sister who\\'s a little bigger than me. these look nice but i don\\'t love the material, i\\'m used to much softer clothing but i haven\\'t washed these yet (because i\\'m not sure if i\\'m returning) and maybe that will make a difference. i love the cut but am not crazy about the large fabric line going down the front of each pant leg. i will update when i have better information to give, for now, 4 stars, id make it 4.5 if i could. shout out to this small business for allowing e to try their pants at a discount for my honest review! love the pants...they fit well......but be prepared to hem the bottom --- which is unfinished.  please finish the edges! perfect love them greatest pants ever!<br />i ordered 2 pairs. one for me, one for my mother!<br />thank you!!! love these knit pajama pants. soft and comfy. fit is perfect. colors vibrant! these scrub pants are by far the best pants i have purchased except they are too long!  i am 5\\'7&#34; and they are a good 2-3 inches too long.  but i love the waistband, and the material is super soft!  definately will purchase again and just hem them!! excelente i\\'m an extremely small person and extra small is generally perfect for me but this extra small was just a little smaller than i expected. i\\'m still able to wear it and i still think a small would have been too big but it\\'s a little but uncomfortable, although i love the way it looks. beauty is pain right. this is just beautiful , excellent quality the medium is a little big and long. the small fits good a little small at first then thy stretch out but are kinda short. but these pants are very comfy!!! i like them. love love love theses scrubs are awesome. if you are like me and enjoy longer tops due to all the bending, lifting, and twisting you do at work than these are for you. they are not see-thru and they are breathable. the fabric is comfortable moves with your body. they are not super thin but are not the thickest scrubs i have come across. please understand these are flexible but are not flexible like stretch jeans or sweat pants are. these are quality scrubs and will last for a while. love all the pockets in both the tops and pants, you can never have too many pockets. i just wish they made different styles so that there was more of a variety for those who want to order more.great scrubs for a wonderful price!<br /><br />update 3/6/16<br />i\\'ve had this scrub set for about 9 months now and they are still going strong. i love have found a new love the smaller pockets outside of the larger ones for pens, flushes, etc. this set hasn\\'t really faded at all the navy blue color is still hanging tough and vibrant. the pants are getting worn a little bit but that is unfortunately because my thighs rub together all day long. the draw sting in the pants are wonderful at keeping them up where they need to be, no need for constant readjustment during my shifts. i ordered a medium. i am 66 inches and weigh 150 lbs its too big i should of ordered a small or x-small. however, i would most definitely recommend ordering this beauty! i bought for my daughter\\'s birthday...she loved it bought this for a 70s birthday party.<br />with platforms and an afro wig, it looks great!<br />not something i would wear everyday, but great for a costume. pants run a bit large wow!! when i opened this i thought i am never going to fit in this. surprisingly they just fit, but they may not last. the material is very thin. overall i like the pants and will be keeping them. very thin but they will be nice for spring and summer and a little big so i would get a size down for sure loved these! had to hem xs bc i am 5\\'1 but otherwise great fit and comfort. wear them for dance class, yoga and everyday wear. my mother loves these.  she used to prefer the dunner polyester but these are so much more comfortable.  these are the only casual slacks i will get her now. true to size. very warm and comfortable.. love this fit, comfort and size of the pants! this is my second pair! i only wish they had been on sale!! good great fit...lots of compliments...love them!  small fit only for the medium.  if you\\'re a size 6, these won\\'t fit you...go one size up i was worried the material would feel cheap but they drape lovely and are so comfy.  great for lounge wear or as a cover up at the pool. amazing quality, came a month and a half early. love these pants! 5\\'2, 115lbs<br />fits perfect. i am sure it could also fit someone taller (lot of slack on me: as in the picture).<br />color even more vibrant and beautiful than in picture.<br />wearing it for clinic, yoga,... lots of compliments.<br />bonus: i was impressed with fast shipping and packaging of item. would definitely buy again from this seller. great pants for many scenarios.  waistband is comfortable and the super-thin fabric is perfect for situations where the weather is warm, but you don\\'t want to wear shorts because of exposed skin, i.e. protection from mosquitos, keeping an injury covered, dusty travel, hiding scars (or tattoos), etc.  perfect for travel because you can pack two pairs in the space of one and they air-dry quickly.  more breathable than rayon or other super-thin travel fabric.  i love being able to sit outside and not have to use chemical bug spray. fits perfect to size pants are very pretty but a lot bigger than i thought they would be.  i ordered the 2x and could have gone very comfortably with a size xl or 1x. different love these lounge pants five star ***** love these!! there are very comfortable even in hot weather. shipping was also very fast. these pants are very comfortable, but really long. i still like them a lot though! very cute and very comfortable. arrived ahead of schedule. love love these!! i love the way they look, i love the way they feel. they are not completely black. the elephants are brown and after a few washes the black actually turns out to just be a very dark brown. the colors bleed very badly the first time you get them wet so make sure to wash them separately. i still love these pants am very happy i purchased them. warm and comfy. medium fits perfectly. great fit. good quality.  i ordered 1 size smaller then i typically wear and they fit perfect! love i like the tight look and feel to it. just like how i wanted :) i just received this item. the pants are well made, very elegant, comfortable fit. i had to return mine because the sized run very small. i reordered two sizes bigger. i have been looking for pants like these and havent been able to find them. worth the hassle. [[asin:b00aqejupq vobaga womens black vintage long pants high waist wide leg flared palazzo trousers]] stretchy and they fit me great. i got a small and i\\'m 5\\'4&#34; 125 pounds, bottom heavy. these pants closely hug my curves, which is what i was looking for, but you\\'ll want to order up for a looser fit. the material is very thin though, and they\\'re not going to provide you any warmth. i use them for lounging around the house, and they\\'re perfect for that. i plan on ordering more, especially considering the price! these pants are very cool and retro.  nice long length. wife loved it and that is all i need i love my new pants, they fit perfectly and they are very soft and comfortable! so, this pants might be the softest thing in the world. seriously.<br />the fit is tighter on the legs then more relaxed towards the top with the pockets. very stretchy, stupid cute and comfy!<br />the patterns are bright and beautiful. (i get lots of compliments on my flower print ones). been through several washes and still holding up great! for reference i ordered the l/xl and it fit me perfect i\\'m 5\\'0 and 170lbs.<br />just get the pants! the price is right! fits very nice even for a curvier girl like myself. fit as expected. a little thin but they are overall very comfortable and would buy them again, especially for the price!! it is very beautiful good quality yoga pants. colors are nice and uniform. material is breathable so you don\\'t get too hot. does not bind when you are doing poses.<br />the only concern is that they run small. the size large is for size 8 which is usually a medium. the size chart on amazon was not working at the time of ordering, or at the time of this review. wish i had gotten a size larger. sample provided for review. the medium size fits well and pant length is just right for a short or petite person. the material feels good to the skin. i love these pants, and the coral was a really nice addition of color to my wardrobe!!  i am 5\\'1&#34; and weigh about 135, i ordered the medium and i am very happy with them.  after reading reviews, i knew that i would have to have alterations done, but that is not unusual for my height, so the fit was exactly as expected!!  i have worn them dressed down during a beach vacation, and then put a different top and shoes on to dress them up for the office, or out for the evening.  very comfortable and flexible pants!!!  i washed them in cold and hung to dry, with no problem of shrinking or losing shape.  the iron well.  very impressed!!  i ordered them in coral and light sand, and i will definitely be ordering more colors.  worth the price and cost of getting alterations for length purposes!! way too long in the legs. great product! fit every curve these pants feel amazing. i just got them and the only thing i don\\'t like are the fake front pockets. other than that, they are super smooth, the hip area is stretchy so it hugs them, and in general i now have the power of leather pants. these pants are some of the softest i\\'ve ever run across! lightweight, slightly sheer but not quite see-through, they are good spring/summer pants. you won\\'t be able to comfortably wear them out in cooler weather, although you still could around the house. they are comfortable enough to sleep in but pretty enough to wear out.<br /><br />i had to experiment with where i kept the waist to have the top gathered area fall at a comfortable place on my body. otherwise, it would have felt kind of like a shelf on top of my rear with the seam. the tie was slightly bulky but i was able to get it out of the way enough it didn\\'t look weird.<br /><br />suggested with a large, free-flowing shirt. :-) docked a star for awkwardness but still really like the pants. good pants. fit a little snug but good. honestly, these fit way better then i expected! i expected them to be a bit tight around the waistband, but they fit perfectly. i wear a size 5-7 in skinny jeans.<br />these are a little bit see through over my butt, but i have kind of a big butt so it\\'s expected. if you have a small butt, it shouldn\\'t be see through.<br />came a week after i ordered, much faster then i expected! very happy over all with them. comfy, fast. everything was great!~  size, color, fabric and service!!!  thank you china!!!! these pants are cute and bright.  they seem to have shrunk in the wash a bit tho, so order a size bigger than u might need.  the fabric is soft and comfy and the material is thin so i can wear them in summer or cooler seasons. awesome fit, sweet colors, but would love it with pockets. do you have some with frogs? very good love it the pants are really comfortable and supper soft i love wearing them around the house, the only thing is that one pants leg is longer than the other but it doenst bother me to much in these days of padded and wired bras of every description, finding minimally invasive, elegant, no muss, no fuss support is cause for celebration. simply put, this bra is, after years of searching, the best one i\\'ve ever come across. i hate to shop but i\\'ve looked for years for something exactly like this bra: lightweight and the closest thing to no bra at all. i just love it! it\\'s perfect, especially for those who are small-breasted and don\\'t need to be severely strapped and hoisted into place. what also amazes me is that this bra doesn\\'t slip-- you don\\'t find yourself pulling it back into place. you put this one on and it seems to become a natural part of your body. like i said, it\\'s perfect for me, and right after the first one arrived, i quickly ordered two more. it\\'s true i could find something cheaper but i\\'m not sure i could find a bra that works this well for me in terms of design and functionality. 4\\'11 95lbs they fit me nicely and are high waisted.<br /><br />if you\\'re anywhere from my size to 5\\'5 150lbs, these will work for you.  very cute pants. we\\'re having exceptionally cold weather (for us) this year in the south, so these flannel lined pants are coming in handy. i walk the dog every day, and these pants keep the cold wind from passing right through to the skin. the exterior fabric is a lot sturdier than i was expecting. these are quality pants. they do run a little bit small. great quality and perfect fit. the pants are long, so expect to wear heals with them. colors are just like the picture. the pants are also noticeable. people give me compliments for them. super idea.  i bought one of these for my wife (had her pick the size of course) and when she got it she was surprised at the quality of the items for the price and how well they fit.  she loved the idea of a mystery box too. fun buy and would be good to send as a gift to female friends and family if you know their general size. bought this for my pirate garb as it looked a little grungy-it will be fine with boots. perfect.  like i jumped out of a comic book. i think these are the best harem pants around. it came in less than week. its worth so much more than the price their selling it for. i\\'m so pleased with them. i think its a great purchase and a excellent buy. just make sure not to dry and hand wash it instead. perfect !!! i am not a medical or dental professional so i am not required to wear scrubs to my job.  i ordered these because i am always impressed by how well scrubs can withstand to a variety of tasks, chemicals, liquids, etc.  i am a mom of two humans and two canines and i am always cleaning up, hosing down, washing off, wiping, rinsing, scrubbing ... something or someone.  instead of messing up my good clothes i decided that scrubs are the way to go.  now, i can\\'t claim i came up with this idea on my own, it was actually a former daycare provider of mine who would wear scrubs each and every day during daycare hours simply because they hold up for the very reasons i listed above.  this pair of pants will need some softener in the wash as you can tell they are new but the fit and length is perfect.  i will definitely be purchasing more!  i received these at a discount in exchange for my honest review. were too large but really nice pants. the color is as displayed, the fit is good, the material is soft as expected, the delivery was on time overall the purchase was very good. i like the material, it is loose, however, and does not fit as i would have expected an extra small to have fit. washes well and keeps me cool during my 12 hour shift. good product. great look and feel for the price. very thin and comfy. i like these leggins because of the length and the shinny buttons. navy blue goes with pretty much any color, so i enjoy these leggings quite a bit. these are almost thick pantyhose. i am a pretty tall woman and i was worried about the length. it fits great and for a size 12-14, it covers appropriately and still manages to be quite sexy. i have gotten a ton of compliments. i loved the inside of these, there amazing! however i was a little disappointed in the fit, most of the leg was a true legging fit, but the ankles were a little loose and the waist didn\\'t have enough elastic so i found myself doing the pants dance all day! koi is my favorite scrubs vendor, for obvious reasons. just look at how cute their scrubs line is. then try on a pair of their super soft and stylish scrub pants or cutie pie tops and you\\'ll be sold too. love this scrub pants.  very comfortable.  i am 5\\'4&#34; and weigh 130 lbs with \\'athletic\\' thighs.  i wear a petite small. probably could wear small regular but with petite they don\\'t drag. great leggies.<br />i love them.<br />shiny. nice.<br />these leggies make muh bum look good.<br />they\\'ll make your bum look good too. really good fabric, nice design but their  size run a little small, i am 2 in several brands and this are smaller, but still looking good 😄 very good 😊 fit great i like it. i love themmm! feels luxurious looks expensive. just what i was looking for. these fit well and are very comfortable. i have laundered them once and they held up o.k. i wear them for lounging around the house. cool comfy comfortable i absolutely love these pants!  they are true to size and very comfortable yet very durable.  i am almost 6 feet tall so purchasing them unhemmed was perfect for me.  love all the pockets etc. as i use them mainly for shooting.  these would be great for the camper, hiker or any outdoor sports woman as well!  highly recommend.  i purchase a couple of pairs and wear them a lot! the joggers came in a couple of days. they are very comfortable; i would definitely buy more. i kinda wish they had black in my size. they fit to your body so you do not have to worry about them being to small or big. light, fits well and has pockets!  have two pair and getting more. these are thinner than i expected and the color is a blueish grey. i have only worn them once so i cannot comment on how well they will hold up after several washings. hopefully well. they did not seem to shrink much at all after the first initial washing which surprised me since they are 100% cotton. will be buying more so soft and comfortable. i\\'m 5\\'4 and had to wear wedges because of the length. it\\'s like wearing super soft pjs out  and still looking nice leggings were as pictured. i saw some comments on colors being different and my pair was not.<br />nice soft lining and material. my kids think the lightning bolts are lots of fun.<br /><br />very high waste though that i was not expecting, even rolling down the band once, it was still above my belly button.<br />only other negative is they don\\'t appear to ware very well...after wearing them for the day, they have the appearance like they may start piling. soft and comfortable. i am 5&#34; 2&#34; and these were perfect length. these pants are wonderful. so comfortable and fit so well. my only complaint is that they don\\'t come in other colors. i ordered a second pair so that i would have them. i really like these pants. the fabric is wonderful. love the print. i do have to order the size large, and return the x-large, as they were too large. but i decided after 2 weeks of religious use, i needed the next size smaller.  the heat of the material really improves your workout; makes warm-up and cool-down much more effective.  the &#34;wet-suit&#34; feel and smell can take a few days to get used to, but after that you\\'re are truly hooked on the product.  i wore slimhot underneath my regular capris and had no chaffing or heat friction whatsoever. excelente love my pants i have already got lots of compliments!! other reviews said to order a size larger and that the pants are too long. i am a small, ordered small and they fit perfectly. i am 5\\'6&#34; and with 2&#34; heeled boots, the length was great. i really love these -- was afraid they would be cheap looking, but they look great. if you want black bell bottoms, you will be very pleased with your purchase! love them love these pants!! lots of pockets and very comfortable the material is kind of odd, but love that it looks just like jeans! pants length a little too long. very comfortable pants, they fit well and seem to be durable enough. would defiantly get more of these. love all the pockets! arrived on time.  item quality and look is better than i expected. the only thing i could say is that i ordered a size 2 and when they arrived the jeans said size 4 so i freaked out but then i read the package insert saying that they were oversees sizes so they know that the 4 there would fit as a 2.  and it did fit perfectly but it was scary for a second until i tried them on haha i love these pants! their comfortable and oh so sexy! i\\'m 5\\' 7&#34; and 130 pounds and they fit perfectly.  i will def be buying more of these best pants yet! so comfy. tons of compliments! i thought they would be tight, but they fit loosely and therefore, having them fit a little snugger was the reason i exchanged.  they are nice and long for me (5\\' 7&#34;) and will have to trim to fit even with my heels, but they make it easy for you by giving directions on how to trim. they fit a little small, but they look great. haha these slacks were very comfortable & true to size these pants are great.  i was a little skeptical of the sizing, so decided to go up a size and am glad i did.  they are a bit long, but fit great with some wedges (i am 5\\'5&#34;).  so glad i got them.  they will be perfect for our upcoming beach vacation. i like the pants but should have guessed that from a distance they would look like skin. my daughter is 5\\'3&#34; and around 100 lbs. i thought they might be a little loose on her but they look pretty much like the model. i\\'m using them as school uniform pants and they show the shirt line when her shirt is tucked in; would be better under a tunic length shirt. i really love these.  wasn\\'t real sure to what size i should buy when i was reading the reviews, so i went down one size.  i believe i could have went down two.  anyway it worked out i still love them these were for my daughter-in-law. she loved them... i\\'ve worn these pants a few times in these 3 weeks since i received them, and they are amazingly comfortable! they do show all of the lumpy business at the top, but with this pant style that is exactly what i expected. just wear a longer top and you\\'re good to go! once you get past the top of the thighs, the wide and flowy cut of the legs gives me the perfect look for my office. they were a little longer than i expected, but that was easily fixed by pairing them with heels (love wearing them with my ankle boots or red suede heels!) i think i\\'ll probably buy another pair next payday, so i have them on hand in case i can\\'t find them again when the time comes to get new ones! i like theses pants. haven\\'t washed them yet though. they it well and are pretty. very slimming.  feel great. these are a solid pair of leggings to have. they have that well known lysse tummy control which makes you look slimmer than you really are.  they make you feel good about yourself. love my new hello kitty lounge pants. they\\'re so soft & snuggly & go with my hello kitty tee\\'s well. thanks!! these are great pants.  fit nice in the hips, waistband doesn\\'t bind and wide enough in the leg to be flattering but not add width or bulk.  fabric is smooth and thick enough to not be clingy.  really great!  more colors and prints please!!!!  no hemming needed, the fabric doesn\\'t fray so a simple snip and i was ready to go.  i\\'ll be wearing these with platform heels and a glitter sweater.  to heck with yoga! love these! these run large, i wear a small and they were about 2 inches to big in the waist and the length. vendor not good on responding to e-mail for a size chart or other info. it\\'s to big returning back for a smaller size 3x ! i love the material i been looking for these kind of pants at the store and online. once i get the perfect fit i might order another ! do i have to make a phone or just use the return sticker ? great transaction, immediate shipping, my wife loves them. she is a preschool teacher and is on the floor with children much of the time. they give her the ability to stretch and move as she needs while covering the parts she doesn\\'t want to be shown. the product looks and fits perfectly. i love it very much!<br />thank you so very much for an amazing product! just the way it should be ! very good !! unless you\\'re a double zero don\\'t order the small. me being a 0-1 its a bit tight. also high waisted. but i still like them a lot. these are my new favorite scrub pants. the waist band is super comfortable and the fit is a little leaner than other scrubs i have purchased. i\\'m 5\\'9, 135 lbs and typically wear a size 6 tall pant. i bought the small long koi pants and they fit perfectly. highly recommend! garment a bit small for normal size. quick shipment and return/refund. i ordered the deep blue and got an aquamarine (rich green-blue).<br />that would have been fine, because the fit is perfect...in every way, except that it is a calf length bottom on me. it looks fine and ankle length on the model, but the legs are short. still, great pants for the price. i\\'m getting another pair n a color that cannot be mistaken this time. very nice fabric and sewing.  true to photo.<br />if it helps other viewers, i am a size 8 in the us usually.  but i do not like to wear very tight clothing.  i do not think this item would comfortably fit anyone larger.  perhaps mordenmiss may find it cost effective to create another larger size as well, so women have two choices? my wife loved these leggings. they fit nicely and she loves how warm they are especially now that it\\'s winter and the temps have dropped. i\\'m 5\\'7&#34; and 135 -- the medium fit perfectly, including length-wise, if i wear them with boots. very comfortable, soft, and the pockets are a plus!  online now looking to buy more in another color. cotton material are thin fits great. super comfy. a lil sheer but works with long shirt although extremely comfortable, these pants will only be worn at home as they have absolutely no &#34;suck um in&#34; function :). they are so comfortable. they do resemble sweats but no one at work has complained yet. soft! not so warm but that\\'s okay. i\\'m proud to say that i started this fad at my high school by wearing this comfortable pants to do colorgaurd in. these pants are stylish and perfect for stretching and doing any kind of workout in them. even pe. the only down side to these pants is the thinness of the material. it kinda wears away a bit. i sugjest reinforcing the crotch part. other than that, these are great pants. get into the fad!! got these for a costume, but i now have it regularly in my normal wardrobe.  the pockets are a normal size (i can fit my samsung mega in them) but they do show up if you don\\'t make sure the pocket is laying flat.  just tuck into boots. i really like these pants.. the linen is a fine weight and drapes well.. i ordered a medium which fit me very well.. i would suggest if you wear a typical size 4 to order a medium size .. this was recommended by the manufacture which i truly appreciate.. the waist is frayed which is different, but i like it! i feel this was an excellent buy for the price, very excellent! i got these on sale.  i like that they are sturdy with stretch and hold me in all the right places.  one of the rhinestones however broke off after the 2nd wear.  they are a little long, but otherwise the size is true to fit.  i don\\'t think they are worth $100 and glad i got them on sale for 60% off. rugged sport pant. the material is a bit noisy, not soft but this is as expected. i love these pants! although it took three orders to get the size right. so glad i finally found the size that fits. so that this review will help other buyers, the pants run so big that i ended up ordering two sizes down, the petite is a touch too long, but that is perfect for me, i like pants are a little long. the quality of the pants made it worth the hassle of returning the first two that i ordered. i have not washed them yet, but i\\'m not worried that they will hold the color and fit. i can order other colors with confidence! thanks to woman within and amazon! these are great shorts for the price and provide plenty of cushion.  however, be aware that these shorts run large compared to the sizing chart.  this is important because the material is not as thick as higher end stretching material used for sports apparel.  my wife and i liked the shorts so well that we reordered the correct sizes.  we cycle frequently on green-ways and trails consisting mileage up to 50 miles leisurely. we gave 4 stars only b/c of the sizing.  super great product for the price! great for around the house and shopping, but they do run somewhat small, but i like the pants. you might like them too and the color is great. love these pants, but they are long arrived on time, my daughter loves them i am very pleased with the fit and fabric of these pants.  i am 5\\'10\\' and a size 12-ish, and they fit perfect!  i love it when that happens, and people want to know where i got my pants. i love these pants! great item i bought these because i havent seen pants like these.  they are the perfect length and size and can be worn with all different types of shirts. the material is a bit thin but its not see through at all. it can be a bit longer though.  i am 5.5 and i got a large and though it slipped down my waist i still like it i love these pants, they fit well in the waist and hips and i didn\\'t have to shorten them where many of the tall pants i have purchased at other stores were way too long.  the price was very good and i will order more of them color is exactly as shown, they are very light, and fit great. i ordered large to ensure the length and fit knowing online shopping here and it fits perfectly. the legs drag the ground but palazzo pants usually do when they fit right, i wear heals with them or expect them to drag some.i assume it will run a little, but do not expect much with this fabric. i love it. exactly what i wanted. i always read through and pick a seller on more than just price, read not just the product feedback but the seller feedback. the waist is not exactly what i would have done but is fine and will be comfortable. came about a month early than expected which is great! fits perfectly. shorts are baggier on sides than i thought but i love it. im usually a small & ordered a large. im 5\\'3 & 110 lbs. & its great! i highly reccomend it. super cozy and warm! these pants have now become my favorite gym/lounge pants...will be ordering more. they arrived on time and as described. on a tight budget, these yoga pants do the trick. although the fabric is very thin, these pants do the job that i bought them for. color as shown. i ordered a size larger and it fits perfectly. they are super comfortable, look good, fit right, and are just what i wanted. i will watch for color runs but doesn\\'t look like it will, i always am careful of deep colors the first time or two though. as always - remember to check seller reviews not just product reviews when you buy to choose a seller. there is a difference between seller error, product error, amazon error, or manufacturer error. i had none in this case but i checked first. nice and roomy and i\\'m 5\\' 8 1/2&#34; and 140 lbs. it fits nice, it sits high on my waist. they are a lot longer than what i was expecting.but overall nice. beautiful. well made -flattering. love it. for the first time in years i am excited to go swimming. cute, cute , cute!! speedy delivery too i read the sizing closely and picked an xxl. i ordered it a week ago and this was fast shipping. the inside is coated with fur and it is so soft. the color is really dark but after washing it separately and tumble drying it, the color lighten up a bit. hope you find this helpful.  i\\'ll try to update it when the weather turns chilly. the foot holes at the bottom have a few dangling/loose threads, but these are still one of my favorite pairs of pants! they are vey soft and comfy and so pretty, my daughter loves them.  i would recommend them to anyone. haven\\'t washed them yet but look and feel of good quality. nice i looked at the size chart and according to it i should order a medium.  i looked at the reviews and saw where these pants run small and to order up a size.  i ordered up a size and they were still too small.  i can get them on but not buttoned without difficulty.  it\\'s a shame because they are super cute.  they are a pretty color, i got the royal blue and the material is soft and not too thin.  the quality is good, just beware of the sizing.  i really like them, i just can\\'t wear them.  maybe if i get back down to a size small they will fit.  i purchased these pants at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. i love these.  comfy and attractive. never having needed thermal pants before, i really had to trust the reviews and then hope i\\'d made the right choice.  going from california to colorado, i was worried about the cold weather.  the  sizing, comfort, and warmth provided by these duofold ankle length pants was perfect.  i have since worn them on chilly ca mornings under my golf pants.  color me a \\\\\\\\\"happy camper.\\\\\\\\\" great cute and comfortable great for me ! im 5\\'5 and like 145 lb , i got a large and it fits perfect ! .. the material is fine and for the price is nice ! if you are taller that 5\\'5 it could be a little short for you .. i love it ! a huge fan of these tights. you cannot beat the price and they look like denim, even up close. i love the black ones also. they are a tiny bit narrow in the upper thigh area when first put on, but within minutes stretch just enough to fit.  they could also be just a tad long but that is very minor. i wear mine with skecher &#34;work boot&#34; style boots and they do just fine. i\\'ve been wearing them quite a bit lately and have received tons of complements.  the fit is very flattering. sure they\\'re made of thin material, but it\\'s strong and as far as i can tell, the material is opaque--you can\\'t see through it. they are extremely comfortable. don\\'t be afraid to purchase, but be aware that these aren\\'t made of denim which is part of the reason they\\'re so inexpensive. you get more than what you pay for, but be realistic in your expectations. fist somewhat snugged for a  large ordered these to have sent to my elderly mother out of state. so great that they are available in plus size short length. she loves them and didn\\'t have to shorten them as usual. thank you! these jammies are so cute i can wear them to cook sunday breakfast and not need to wear a robe. i choose these to wear when i went in to have knee surgery and am glad i did.  i will be wearing these for along time.  well made the pockets are a great plus for me. they fit great at the beginning of the day but stretch out to be  bigger by the end. overall they are a great pant. i loved the outfit on me but they are a bit see through. i just wore a bando underneath and spanks from cheer. looked amazing at my graduation party. i\\'m a fan, my boyfriend loves them on me, and they were cheap. the material is a little thin but whatever, i like the way they fit, they breathe. :) the details on the pants are very cute.  i wish they were just a little higher waisted to avoid that dreaded and inevitable muffin top but that\\'s my carb living self\\'s fault- not the jean\\'s. i bought these pants for my cousin\\'s wedding -- a beach wedding in virginia at the end of september, which means there just is no planning for the temperature. oh yeah, and i\\'m 8 months pregnant, too, so that made outfit planning easy.<br /><br />these pants are a nice, light weight, with a very flattering fit. the waistline had a little difficulty staying up underneath my rather large belly, but they certainly did the job. i got a few compliments that i looked nice (which, as anyone who has ever been 8 months pregnant will tell you, is not so often), and i was comfortable all evening long. they\\'re nice enough to be dressed up, but casual enough i can just wear them around the house later. if you have big hips/legs, expect the design of the cats to stretch and look weird but it\\'s good either way really really cute but this runs really small. i ordered a medium and it\\'s still quite snug! on the plus side, i bought these for the gym, so it\\'s incentive to tighten up those abs ;) they look amazing on my wife and arrived quickly. i liked them but they didn\\'t fit. sizes run at least one size too small. i returned them and received a refund in a timely manner. given as a gift haven\\'t had any complaints best fit ever. the trouser legs are not overly wide. this provide for a nice fit. i get a lot of compliments on them. but nicely made they were what i wanted. i like these because they are so light in weight! i love the beige color i purchased as well! these leggings were nice when i tried them on, they\\'re made good quality and everything. they fit me fine but i\\'m also a size 2 in juniors. they say one size fits all but trust me, do not get these if you are bigger than a size 4 or 5. they are not stretchy at all. unlike what some other people said, they are a very thick material, which i like, so i don\\'t have to worry about my panties showing hahah, but they do not stretch very easily. also the stripes on these are kinda weird, theyre curved, not straight but thats just a minor detail. still very nice leggings and i\\'m happy with them. fits great i\\'m going to aruba in nov and these are perfect for a comfy day out. very very cute!!!! super well made! a little large, but that\\'s so much better than too small! love them and they\\'re a good price. just a word to the wise: like many have said, they do run a bit big. plus, like any pants, they stretch with wear. i bought a second pair a size smaller and they seem to do the job! nice fit was very excited because normally i do not wear printed ... and this model i found it very cute ...this seller is very attentive to the needs of buyers and resolves any objection to the sale, thanks for the help! a bit snug around the calve area, but creates a very attractive silhouette.  i like these very much.  they look great with a boxy top. good quality for the price; fold-able waist is very comfortable-not too short/long or loose/tight; leg length perfect-i\\'m 5\\'9\\\\\\\\\"--usually wear a medium but ordered a large based on other reviews; material is not see-through but still thin enough for movement yoga class. they\\'re cute but my butt almost sticks out. i am 5\\' tall and weight 120 lbs. i have a little bit of a butt but these shorts barely cover it. i wear a size 2 in clothing so for me to be popping out is a little silly. this is definitely made for an extremely petite female, or maybe a teenager with no curves. very comfortable.  i\\'ve worn them countless times! had a 10 inch rip in the inner seam that she needed to stitch otherwise very warm and comfortable. i love these! fits perfectly i really like the color and print of these palazzo pants, however being only 5\\'3\\' they are super long for me and will have to be tailored.<br />they are light and comfortable and so worth the price. my wife really liked this since it made her ride more comfortable, but she mentioned that it ran a little big nice shorts for women ..very stylish super comfortable! these pants are so nice. i get lots of compliments and they actually make my 5\\'4 150 lb body look very lean and sleek. i ordered the large. so excited that these pants are just as stretchy as i had hoped; much like the beloved ponte fabric that drapes silkily in any season, but these palazzo\\'s are definitely light enough for even a north carolina summer night\\'s or beach night wear!  and the pattern is well printed and my favorite camo-like in that grass green shade that is so hard to find in a world of avocado and puke green today!  so, thanks for offering this pattern in a well cut, well sewn, well proportioned.  i normally may wear a 1x if i am buying from monroe & main or roamans, even womanwithin...but if i am shopping a targgett or w..mart, i am definitely going to have to buy a size 24w, even though i am a petite.  it\\'s hard to pull off petite after you pass 150 lbs, and i did that 35 yrs ago!  anyone who does any clothes and shoe shopping today will just have to accept the fact that every retailer is putting out sizing they picked out of the wind; it\\'s not like anyone makes them provide actual dimensions in inches, and if they do give inches of length and width, it does not give how stretchy the fabric is, so you don\\'t know if it will actually fit you or not.  today\\'s draping of pants and skirts needs a bit of compression around the mid thigh and natural waist, more like the relaxed fit\\'s opposite!  i don\\'t want a baggy butt and droopy thighs, and then have to struggle to walk because the knees, calves or ankles are tight!  i am very pear shaped, weigh 204 on a good day (lbs) have spinal disease so cannot walk well or long, and my guts have just bulged out along with the lumbar muscles swelling with spasms, making my middle the biggest yet these pants fit nicely, but with a big middle, i wear tunic and babydoll shaped things with plenty of a-line below the bosom.  i got the 3x and i wear a 48-52&#34; waist on different days, with a 54&#34; hip. very nice pj bottoms.  good quality flannel, i have washed these several times with little or no shrinkage or fading.  they are well priced and i would purchase them again.  bottom line they get a high recommend. i am pleased with this item and seller. the pants were true to size (they were a bit long, but not enough to be bothersome), soft, and comfortable. after a workout, they give a little/stretch, but this is not a negative to me. i\\'ve enjoyed them so much i just purchased a second pair. cute alternative to plain stretch yoga pants runs small.  but very nice pants.  will return for larger size.  buy one size bigger. update:  the largest size they have is a women\\'s medium, which is really a women\\'s small. they fit true to size, but the color is much darker than pictured (i got them in heather gray) , these pants are really dark and that pic is misleading! i like these. they fit like capris on me  (5\\'7&#34;), nice material, interestingly clever design. im a dude, a bit on the tall side (im 5\\'11&#34;), and i thought these were a bit short.<br /><br />i think these are awesome for lounging around the house but my gf makes fun of me and tries to tell me i cant wear them around her. these were nicer than expected. they hugged everything just right & left nothing &#34;hanging&#34;. the material is great and added a nice kick to my outfit. my measurements are 36-30-44 & i ordered a large just incase you\\'re wondering whether you\\'ll be able to wear these if you\\'re bigger on the bottom; i always wish reviewers would list their measurements so i can know better how to order. :) love them really cute pants for my daughter they are about 3&#34; too long other than that..they fit pretty well very comfortable, lightweight pants.  nice on a hot summer day.  the fabric is quite thin, so i wear spanx underneath that keep my behind and upper thighs looking more firm.  i wear them without the spank around the house, they are great for lounging.  i am almost 5\\'5&#34; and usually a size 10, i do have to wear a 1 1/2 or 2 inch heel with these, otherwise they are touching the floor.  i plan to buy more of these. great really nice fabric. very comfortable.i like it) i wore my pettipants for the first time and had to laundry it for the first time this week. it was cool, comfortable and a pleasant style. i would highly recommend ordering this item. very nice pants, run slightly small, but should fit well soon. love these pants. fit great true to size i am 5\\'8\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\" and these pants fit well.  i ordered the \\\\\\\\\"tall\\\\\\\\\" and they are perfect. super cute pants but i\\'m 5\\'8&#34; so they look like capri\\'s on me, kind of an awkward fit. just got these, they are really comfortable and they look like they\\'ll hold their color wash after wash, but i haven\\'t washed them yet. low quality, fabric tore easily when i caught the belt loop on a dresser knob, cute pants. despite the quality, i am probably going to get them in another color. these look extremely flattering!! i am 5\\'8, 140 #. these pants were nice and fit well. despite not being too small they were a bit shiny when on - in a way that made them look a bit to small (not the fit but the fabric). so i sent back. i have several pairs of these scrub pants but the limited edition gray/pink ones don\\'t fit like the others.  the legs are much wider.  hoping they shrink in the wash. perfect fit! nice given as gift and the person loved it love these pants. so comfortible. i\\'m a size 3 in jeans and ordered a small and they fit great only thing is that they are very very long but that doesn\\'t bother me at all. comfy! a bit long for me 5.2 they are just what i wanted! i am 5\\'3&#34;,  116 lbs, and the small fits just right. love these!! finally yoga pants that are not tight on my ever growing belly. these are so soft and comfy, i imagine i\\'m going to be living in these pants. highly recommend!! a great item thease are sexy! sexy! sexy!!! i love the bright colors and love wonder woman thing is i\\'m 5 foot and it still hangs before my ankles..now i\\'m not sure if they are pants high waters over all just know if your taller then me they will not fall to your feet like most pjs. however i\\'m not picky when it comes to night clothes. when i ordered the wrong size, xl, i figured a medium might be just a little snug but it was not. in fact, i had room to really feel comfortable and i stay warm. i ordered these lounge pants and the &#34;alki\\'i luxurious cotton lycra fold over yoga pants&#34; on the same day.<br />both appear identical online, however, they are not.<br />the alki\\'i yoga pants are a heavier material and a less flattering cut, but still nice.<br />these lounge pants do run somewhat small.  two recent abdominal surgeries have resulted in a weight loss that has left me at<br />85lbs and the small size fits perfectly, snug and very flattering.  i might add that they are very comfortable over my recovering incision.  i have several pairs and wear them everywhere since i cant wear my jeans just yet.<br />i would recommend these lounge pants! as described,fast shipping. this set is reallly nice, very soft & comfortable & i get alot of complaments every time i wear it. it fits true to size, i plan on buying more ! very happy with this purchase ! soft fabric, great color i purchased these in blue.  the pants tie so will fit anyone any size.  better than pajama bottoms.  i will definitely shop with this vendor again.  fast shipping, excellent customer service very comfy pants!! somewhat large i will begin by saying the slacks i bought are just a touch large. i love them anyway and have ardered another pair in a 1x. my mom tried them on and immediately bought 2 pair. they can easily be worn for work or casual occasions. i wish there were more colors. these feel as comfortable as a sweat pant but look so much better. length is good and i am 5\\'5&#34;. i can wear with a 3 inch boot or a running shoe ( mine has a spring heal). both shorter inseam and smaller waist than advertised. i\\'m 5\\'10&#34; & 230# but it still fit me fine. just makes for a smaller cross-fold when wearing. very comfortable, soft fabric in a coarse weave. does not look like the fabric or stitching will stand up to very heavy wear, but for the price i can\\'t complain. i love the pants they are so comfortable i will be buying more my favorite pair of sweat pants. snug around the ankles, soft and warm. buenos these are great, i love them. i received so many compliments when i wore them to work. i only ordered one pair because i wasn\\'t sure if i would like them, now that i have them i ordered 4 more. i read the reviews on line, it said that they run small (i usually take a small or medium depending on how they run) so i ordered a large which fit well, not too tight with plenty of room. material feels good put on and they felt great. i really want most of the colors.will buy more. i appreciate the fact that they were so helpful in the exchange of the larger size.  i really love the pants and love the way they fit.  thank you great color love these pants. they are super cute and stretchy i wear them all the time lol one of my favorite pairs love them ,fit great so very soft . i love these leggings so much. they\\'re sleek and high waisted... super flattering and not see.through like a lot of leggings. they did get a hole in them almost immediately but for $6 it\\'s worth the inconvenience of sewing it up. fast shipping. thanks perfect and comfortable!!! best scrubs ever! it\\'s simply the best, and for the right price! i absolutely loves the way it fits, and everyone keeps asking about the designer! kudos to the allegra k brand! they are comfy.... i dont know if they are supposed to be tight...they arent baggy but not tight... make whooshing noise..but i wear them when i work out at home..not to gym... i do sweat in them... i don\\'t know if that\\'s doing anything...but love these, perfect color and i love the flare bottom, looks great with a long top, or sweater. would buy these again! love this pant . didn\\'t give it a,5 star due to the fact that it could be a little longer to be a &#34;real&#34; jumpsuit.  i am 5\\'2 (on a good day), 36c cup size, usually a  medium top and size 4 pants. this fits perfect as just a pants but for a jumpsuit i personally would rather it a bit longer on the top/waistband section. still love it and about to order another color so cute and sexy.. substantial materials these are very lightweight pants, not &#34;see through&#34; though. i am 5\\' 6&#34; ,125 pounds and the medium length was perfect. they fit snugly around waist, hips and thighs but are very comfortable due to easy stretch. they hang nicely. these pants are perfect for women who are tired of torturing themselves by trying to wedge into low rise tight pants, but who still want to look good. i love these things. the are a little shear, but not bad. they are so dang comfy, it\\'s ridiculous.<br />for the price, what a deal. yoga pants aren\\'t cheap. and these are great quality.<br />love them, i\\'ll def be ordering more. these are long, but if you know basic sewing, i bet they\\'d fit most body shapes. the fabric is very stretchy and light (though not see-through). i almost feel naked when i wear mine.<br /><br />i am 5\\'2&#34; and 145 pounds. i ordered the large, and they felt too loose around the waist. exchanged for a medium. it still feels loose, but comfy and doesn\\'t feel like it\\'s going to fall down (the large did). it was super long, but felt so good when i put it on i decided to cancel the return. i took about 3 inches off the bottom (i could have probably gotten away with 2) using a great hem tutorial on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykhjaamn8jm. it mostly took time pinning these, but it was pretty easy to trim them down and worth it—given how well made and affordable they are.<br /><br />now they fit great and look wonderful. will be ordering another color soon in small. i have a feeling it will still fit but will hopefully be shorter. love all the pockets, especially the one on the side of the pants for my phone! very comfortable material. i love the fit!  great for working out or just relaxing around the house. will buy in a different color. these fit great and are very comfortable. cheap and cute couldn\\'t ask for anything better very nice quality .it fits well. i will buy again but different color. love these!!! good just how i expected very see thru!! :-/ got these today to wear for an upcoming vacation. they have a nice cut and the linen is light but opaque so no worries on show through. i\\'m 5\\'9 and have no issues with length. fit seems only slightly smaller than average. i ordered large. one caveat though. the waistband is created from a thin, rayon (viscose) jersey knit that isn\\'t enough to keep the pants up if you have narrow hips like me. since the waistband is an open tube, it should be no problem to slip some elastic in and then sew a channel for it so it doesn\\'t move. great price though and i would buy again but i\\'m a sewer so if you don\\'t know how to sew i\\'d imagine it would be frustrating. these pants would have been perfect if not for the cheap knit waistband. getting them in every color!<br />i am 5\\'5\\' 160lbs female and they fit perfectly. no muffin top, no camel toe. not see thru like most other material leggings. comfortable good quality. i will recommend these to everyone! sizes as stated run small. long length is perfect. i returned them only because they ran small. great a little bit to large good sweating with this pant but you have to do some workout not just wear it and sit down :) pretty tight and thin. i realize they were described as lightweight and they are yoga pants, but it seemed to be a little tighter than it needed to be. i read the reviews and went by the sizing chart. the ite, is really nice, but the sizes are not regular sizes. need to look at the size chart (which we did not) to make sure you order what fits. this are really skinny  sizes, abote 4/5 inches smaller than regular. i received my order today, it was well packaged. i really like the material and how the have a zipper and belt hoops, i\\'m very impressed. i had ordered a color i didn\\'t need and didn\\'t read the return policy. if you return an item they will charge you a 15% re-stocking fee even if you want to exchange the item for a different color or size. so make sure you want the item before you purchase the item!! i bought these for myself. i work from home and find them extremely comfortable. sizing is accurate. wish i\\'d ordered more!! love these pants!!! i\\'ve bought them before in a different color and they last forever! these pants are in a beautiful icy shade of blue. the fabric drapes very nicely, and the belt adornment is stylish and classy. i will be wearing these a lot! just what i was looking for unlined pants with pockets for tennis. very slimming. somewhat large...will order a medium next. have to tie them as tight as i can. i had the impression that these ran big so instead of large i got the medium\\'s.  they fit like leggings except with more coverage. but they stretch out as you wear them. so by the end of the day they\\'re fitting like regular pants. never seen pants quite like them but they have become my go-to for casual wear. i love the stretch and comfort so i decided to buy the  other two colors. the seams are all straight and they seem to be very well made. for only $11 i think it\\'s an exceptional value. though i do agree that getting feet through ankles is a tight squeeze. love these a few years ago, i noticed scrub pants on sale at walmart & realized they are good, light weight pants for summer. as i enter my senior years, i look for comfort. either stretch or a bit baggy. scrub pants are perfect for summer. so when i see a good sale on amazon or walmart, i buy some. i bought several pairs on amazon recently. they are durable, considering how light weight they are. or i\\'m just not that hard on them now that i\\'m older. and they seem to resist stains. i have a few different brands, depending on the sales i find & am very happy with them. i avoid the scrub blouses because i\\'m not in the medical field & wouldn\\'t want to be mistaken & expected to do things i can\\'t do, lol. nice durable run a bit big very soft and comfortable best work pants i have ever had: 5 years and only my 3rd buy. fabulous as always great length. the size is very big because of the drawstring waist, but it fits great once tied the drawstring which makes it great for multiple sizes. i absolutely love these pants. the fit is perfect. quality is awesome. i definitely highly recommend this item. shipping was fast. print is pretty good and they are comfortable. shipping was a tad slow and they are a bit shorter than i would personally like. i would still recommend them though. excelent omg i love it ❤️!<br />perfect size .. thank you :) great fit and great for the long bike rides with the thin seat comfortable! my wife is looking good in the neighborhood. good fit, nice style and wears nicely. shipped and received on time. nice doing business with you! amazing! i live these shorts, perfect for summer ! i loved these....i sure wish i had not accidentally put them in a load of laundry that had bleach in it. i had to throw them away. but i loved them...they fit great and were soft. excellent pants! comfy....hood quality...definitely will buy again in other colors if available. i like it but the material was not what i thought it would be this garment runs smaller as others had said. i am 5.2 and 115 lbs and size l fits perfectly. i love these pants as they are soft and comfortable. i bought 2 pairs and would live in them if i could. highly recommend. these pants are great, especially if you are tall. beautiful color! very vibrant!<br />fits perfectly  (5\\'2, 115lbs) but will also fit someone taller.<br />wearing it in clinic and yoga.<br />of note, when wearing it with a tank top and a sweater, the waist bank is covered by the shirt unlike on model (not a bad or good thing, this is just fyi, as the waist band is also pretty) love the pants! covers lumps and bumps! very comfortable. my only wish is that they had a pocket. these are great fun!  they run very long so if you are not tall be prepared to hem.  they are worth hemming though.  the only drawback is the fabric is very thin (see through).  so i just where tights with them or a long top but i&#34;m glad i added them to my wardrobe and the price was great. very comfortable pants. i\\'m amazed i found a pair that were actually long enough. i\\'m 6\\' and these pants actually are long enough. they could be a hair longer but work good with flats. it fits just right i am an emergency room nurse and have been wearing this brand of pants for eight years now. i have just recently started needing replacements. they all seem to wear out in the same place, the inner thigh, but i definitely got a ton of wear out of them. the only drawback i have found is sizing. i have bought several pairs in the same sizes over the years but every so often there will be a pair that seems oddly sized. just something to keep in mind. these pants have tons of pockets and are really comfortable to wear for 12+ hours at a time. super cute, comfortable. i love maaji so i was overall pleased with my purchases. hugs your figure 100% love these pants. fits perfect, true to size, very soft good material, and it does look like skin like the other reviewer said. i love these jeggings so much! a must buy!! super soft! my new favorite pair! they are &#34;junior&#34; sized so pick your size accordingly. great pants, slimming, fit well with room to grow. a great, dressier, alternative to regular leggings. just enough belly support while still being an under the belly style. they fit well for me i am 179 5\\' 5&#34;. i love them. i purchased a large. i will be ordering these again. thin, comfortable. the pants are nice, wash and dry well, but are larger than i expected. i probably could\\'ve gotten a size smaller. the rise comes almost up to the bottom of my bra!!!  i got the 1x, and i wear a snug size 18 jeans, so i know a woman who wears a 2x could probably fit into the 1x with no problem. i wear mine with a maidenform flexees cami over them, and it holds them up just fine. love the item!!! it actually fits! !! i absolutely love these shorts! nice quality.... and is good for the price... runs a little small, so i have to buy another one.... pants are true to size and light fabric great for summer might not want to get it them wet.  i would. recommend. fabric is beautiful.  soft and comfortable.  the fit is just as described. long for me but easy to trim:)! these pants were perfect.  we had forest gump day at work and put with the right shirt and shoes and it was just perfect.  i am a size 8 and these pants fit perfect.  they were long, but easily took a pair of scissors to cut to right length.  no fray because of the material.  these might be just what you\\'re looking for! they were too small i gave them to my 16 year old daughter and they look amazing on her. thank y\\'all very much these are the perfect gauchos for us buxom ladies!  they are light and airy, the fit is exactly as the size link provides and, best of all, they help cover the tummy area quite nicely.  i will be buying more of these before summer arrives!  my only disappointment is that they are not available in a selection of colors!  truly, that\\'s the only bad thing i can say about them... should\\'ve went by the sizing chart instead of listening to everybody say grey\\'s anatomy ran small. returned large for medium which fits my size 8 bottom half quite well. love the slim fit too. i bought two pair of these to wear when i lounge around the house. they are true to size and very cute. the quality seems ok for the price. i would buy them again. only reason i gave these a 4 star instead of 5 is the color is listed as mint and they are really an aqua or torquoise love them..perfect.. great good quality. i was apprehensive about ordering because the description was incomplete but they are a lovely pare of culottes.  the size is somewhat smaller than the advertised l so i\\'m glad i read all the reviews.  it would have been nice if the material\\'s fiber and weight had been identified too. very casual, loose and breezy. wore them at burning man. plenty of room for a man. these pants are perfect if you\\'re a working mom.  they\\'re stretchy and really comfy...they\\'re not super skinny so they won\\'t stick to your legs.  it\\'s a little long for me but i\\'m 5\\'0 so i\\'m going to have to get it altered but it really is comfortable on my growing belly and will look cute with some wedges.  can\\'t wait to wear it with my lk white tank i just bought!  seriously, lk beats anything you can buy at those maternity stores at the mall.  i really think it\\'s the quality of the fabrics.  whoooo hooooo! i ordered these pants for my mom.  i was guessing at the size 14, but knew she wore petites.  as it turned out, 14 was correct, but the petite was too long.<br /><br />the pants are a nice quality, and after hemming them up for her, i\\'m sure she\\'ll get a lot of good out of them. these pants are amazing on and so unique in appearance. they fit according to size and launder nicely. the material is a perfect weight. i\\'m 5\\'7&#34; and 132 pounds. i ordered a small, and while they fit great in their length, they\\'re big around the waste. to my disappointment they fall off while walking. something to note here is that i have no butt! so nothing to hold them up! take that into consideration! i\\'m going to try to shrink them a little so that they\\'re wearable! overall great pair of pants. i usually wear a size 2-4-6 depending on the brand of pants. i decided to purchase a size medium because thats what<br />the equivalent of us size recommended. these pants are super cute !! but a tad too small. i\\'m going to keep them because i washed them and didnt dry them, but instead, pulled on the waist in many different directions to make them larger.<br />i am going to purchase the next size up and hopefully they will fit me to a tee ! bright teal as picture online. love the fit, low rise. length perfect though i normally am between petite and regular length. these pants are cute, comfortable, breathable, and fitting but they are extremely long! you may have to get them hemmed, but they are cheap! some reviewers stated that these are not big. since fit is relative, i\\'ll try to provide context. previously, i had bought a regular &#34;one-size&#34; pair of thai fisherman pants from nepal that i bought off the rack at the gem show here and those fit me, but without folding them vertically at the hip, so the fit was comfortable but did not conform to the intended ideal.<br /><br />these &#34;husky candy&#34; pants are huge on me, and very comfortable. the exact measurements, now that they have been washed many times: 27&#34; wide at the top (54&#34; total circumference), 17.5&#34; drop from belt to crotch, and 36&#34; from belt to hem. i am 5\\'8&#34; and they do not pool around my heels like in the image, so yes, they are short. if your circumference is greater than your height, or you are very tall and husky and want a loose fit, this pair probably is not the one.<br /><br />my only complaint about these pants is that the material is forming little pills in the thigh area from friction, and the color has a slight lavender tint, rather than pure gray. also, i\\'m not an expert on textiles or anything, but the texture of the material is boring and seems cheap. just as in picture...very nice.. so very comfortable and i love the pocket. i didn\\'t realize it had a pocket when i picked them out because i didn\\'t care if i had one. my iphone 6 fits in it. i loved this pants! the delivery is good and fast. the size fits me well and the cotton is really soft. it\\'s more suitble for a hot summer, and it is very relaxed, not tight though. anyway, i recommend. love love love. fits really nice. soft material!! very flattering. i work in a salon and the hair slides right off!! will defiantly buy more!! decent capri pants. lightweight and baggy. beware of description though. description says 100% cotton but the pants are actually a blend of cotton and polyester. very comfy! does seem to run a little large. it fits nice, good material and keep real warm ! very cute the pants fit a little snug. .i wish they were a little larger but i would definitely order more..the material is very breathable. :) overall i\\'m satisfied... i wear these scrub pants three days a week as an er nurse. i own three pairs, so they get washed every single week. i have owned them for over a year and they fit exactly the same. i recently just purchased a new pair for the occasional 4th shift and the color on the new pair matches the old pairs exactly, these pants haven\\'t faded one bit. stains are easy to remove and they were comfortable from day one. i highly recommend grey\\'s scrubs. i am 5\\'4 and weigh around 130- i do have some hip, but find that the extra small still fits. the smalls were becoming a little too loose on my frame. if you carry weight in the lower half though, the small is your better bet.  these are a great purchase at any size. it is comfortable and the women really admire it. best pants ever, professional enough for work but moves like yoga pants these are lighter-weight than i thought they\\'d be, more suitable for summer than winter -- but oh my!  they are absolutely luscious to wear.  they feel silky and soft, a little clingy but not too much, with a waistband that gently hugs my waist without either pinching or sagging.  i\\'m not much for glamour, but i feel put together in these pants, and they\\'re elegant with a nice blouse.  but the best part about them is really how they feel...  caressingly soft, with a lovely drape.  i wore them traveling coast to coast, and although i was in planes and airports for over twelve hours, they didn\\'t chafe once, not anywhere.  they just felt cuddly and soft all through the long, difficult day...  yummy!  needless to say, i\\'m buying more pairs... i bought these for my daughter and she\\'s usually a size medium, asian size small. when she tried these on, the frayed parts in between the rips were way too tight against her legs when she bent them. also had to make my own hole just to button the pants; there was none there to fit the button into when i had un-packaged them. would not order again from this company. i absolutely love these pants! great color and really comfortable. i only wish it had cargo pockets for storage space but if you dont need the extra pockets, i definitely recommend these. very comfortable. i love mine but now i have lost some weight and they are falling off i do love them and there comfortable good quality. but size is way too small was as expected<br />and looks very nice thank you very happy thank you<br />love the pants ! the picture for these pants makes them look like a purple paisley (on my computer at least), but they are more magenta and red. they are very pretty and after washing become softer. and they\\'re not too long for me (i\\'m 5\\'2). these fit very well, even the length.  i find them comfortable.  i wish i could have found black in my size, though. i\\'ve  used bend over slacks before & have always been favorably impressed. these are some of the most comfortable pants i have ever bought. will be buying more in different colors!! love these.. got the dark navy today in size 22 wish i would of got a 20 or 18 they are so comfy hope they are going to get more soon i also ordered the beige still waiting.. but the other pair came within 3 days very pleased with delivery...please get more in! been looking forever for these!! you will not regret ordering!! medium is probably a small - i run a victoria\\'s secret jean size 2 and these fit without a lot of wiggle room. they are well made with nice details - buttons, pleats etc. shipping was prompt though product ships from china so not 2 day cute, fun pants. the waistband is slightly less soft than i expected, but i still love them. honestly, given the price and how generic the product description is i was expecting these pants to be of shoddy construction and material. i am pleasantly surprised! fit is great. very flattering. material is lightweight and breathable but not so much that it\\'s transparent. i feel secure in these and don\\'t feel like i\\'m showing it all to the world. i got the neon green capris (not the black which i think might be totally different in cut and material). i\\'m ordering several more pairs! great fit, cool, comfortable recieived my order fast and was sort of worried because i ordered my real size...they fit great and feel wonderful...going to order more...!!!! i wore these for the last two months of my pregnancy and still wear them now.  they are lightweight (great for summer) but still cozy. i really like the style of these pants and eventually i will be able to wear them.  i have no complaints. great fit they are very nice tights.  i am 5\\'4&#34; and they were quite long on me.  i took them in and hd them shortened two inches. i bought a medium size and these were way too small. these might be a medium for juniors not womens\\' size.  at least that was my experience.  the shorts are super cute though. love these pants. just expensive :) but works great soft and comfortable. super comfortable and soft. i wear them around the house and as pajama pants. the model in the picture is wearing heels with them, but frankly i would never want to pair these with heels and wear them out. they\\'re great for lounging, but that\\'s about it. relaxed fit for a little more give in thighs and seat.  very comfortable these are exactly what i was hoping for...they fit very nicely and perfect for a more casual work pant. great pants! love the cut and fit very well. i will be ordering another pair. as a side note, the fabric is very soft and picks up hair from long hair dogs/cats profusely. only giving four starts based on appearance alone, the material is not see through from what i can tell. i\\'m 5\\'5 138 pounds and the m fits well even with a little room in the waist. we will see how they fare after a few weeks of use. perfect fit, comfy! i debated long and hard about what size to order. i\\'m normally a ladies 8-10 so decided on the 3xl. they\\'re perfect! just the right fit. they fit awkwardly however still wearable, they keep you warm under your clothes. the leggings are thicker than expected and totally opaque. they feel nice on and are a good length (i\\'m 5\\' 7&#34;). i probably could have gone down a size, but i am happy with these. i ordered 3 pair of leggings and i absolutely love them...the material is so smoove...and they hug my curves just the way i like them...i plan on ordering more love love love these!! they r cute they cud hv been a lil bigger but they look gd on she like them happy new yr... excellent buy. good quality for the price. great fit, quick shipping very comfortable, great fit cute pants that are very comfy. these pants fit as discribed. they are high on the waist. i am 5 feet tall and didn\\'t have any problems with these being to long. i am happy with these pants! comfortable. i wish i could get in other colors absolutely love these shorts! i wore them to mexico. we hiked, rappelled down waterfalls, and zip lined and they were perfect. they dry quickly and they don\\'t ride up. i highly recommend! awesome!!! perfect see through!!! but very sexy! i\\'m a bit curvy (150, 5\\'7&#34;) and these pants look fierce with high heels, very slimming! i got complimented a lot! i wore them out to the bar so in the dark you couldn\\'t see my thighs and panties through them (although apparently you still could a little). i do not know how they fit, gave as gift and never heard. nice for the price. i got the black with green marijuana leaves. i just got them this a.m.(delivery was on time) for a pro cannabis event. i love the fit, they are very comfy. the only reason i gave 4 is because by the time i took them off they were already starting to fray in some areas. for the price i can\\'t complain, it\\'s not bad enough that i cannot wear them :) these look great and are very comfortable even on hot, humid summer days. the only problem is that the fabric is thin and will rip if stretched too far. comfortable. fits well. pleased with purchase. fit well.  i like the fabric they are made of.  the size is a little bit large, but i like my pants loose.  so i am happy with them., i am the type that gets cold all over on the cold winter nights.  the henley, which i just love, keeps you warm and are very comfortable to wear.  i like the color of grey and they are so easy to wash. nice soft light weight knit pants.  the waist is rather high but i just roll the band over once and they fit perfect and still look great.  length is long but i have to hem everything; only 5.1\\' tall.  for anyone who does have to resort to hemming, it was a breeze.  i will probably order a couple more of these for summer; i do not like wearing shorts and these are a light and breezy alternative.  someone said the fabric was thin but i did not find this to be so. good quality. fits very well. i\\'m 5\\'9&#34; and they are the perfect length for me. i\\'m 200lbs and the xl fit great. i would say they are true to size. not too thin. fun pant to wear. i bought based upon other buyer\\'s comments and went a size smaller. they fit okay but i wouldn\\'t wear them in public. i would buy true to size if i bought again. love these pants. bought them in black, tall large. they\\'re very flattering to the derriere - fitted without being tight; no panty lines here -  and plenty long, even for a very long-legged girl. i have three other pairs of yoga style pants from different places (target, old navy, & victorias secret) and these are by far my favorite for overall fit and comfort. the little pocket inside the waistband is a nice touch too. i think i\\'ll buy them in the gray color as well! they feel and look great. i do recommend them. super cute and fun! fit awesome these are stinking awesome.  get them.  usually wear a medium top?  get medium.  they are quite long for me (5\\'4&#34; 135lbs). but they could not be a better fit or more comfy.  i feel sexy going to t he gym in these.  get them!  bought black and black with white.  probably gonna order more. fit just right and not that annoying tight feeling ... smooth comfortable and breathable nice scrubs. won\\'t  wrinkle. these pant are a little tight, but the material is thick and stretchy (not a combination you see everyday) so they act more like compression pants which is good for slimming down i am tall so they are not made for tall people but i love how comfortable they are.. i got this set for my mom and it fit her perfect, she was very happy and she loved the color!!! these fit well just to long. i\\'m 5 feet 8 inches tall and these pants i step on them. i do love these. i\\'m going to hem them so i don\\'t step on them. if you are a short person you will need to hem them. they are good quality t- shirt material fit womans curves. the leggings are nice and warm but they are kind of snug. there are actually super tight. i got a 10 long. but other than that very comfy for how tight they are! defiantly can\\'t wear there to work!! i brought these for my daughter & she loves them, and they came earlier than specified. nice i am in love with this pants,.!!!! get lots of complements,they are very comfortable,well made,great purchase! i love these pants but will have to get them hemmed. i am 5\\'8 and these are way too long for me. unless you have 4 inch heels to wear with them... the heels in the picture make the pants look weird, but these pants are awesome with a pair of cognac booties or ever short gladiators. so comfortable, they\\'re my new leggings!!!!! great fit and so comfy!!! i have such a problem finding pants that are comfortable and fit, having a thickish waist and a rather flat derrière.  but these pants fit perfectly and look nice too.  so far, so good! i bought the viv collection women\\'s solid wide leg palazzo soho gaucho pants and i love them!!! they fit perfectly!! these pants are so comfortable and very flattering. i recently lost a lot of weight and these pants really compliment my new figure! i highly recommend this seller! i love these pants! surprisingly they fit!!  i am 5\\'3 and weigh 135..i normally would wear a size 7, and i love them ...honestly i would never consider them to be leggins the pattern on them are unique and very good quality almost leather like.no regrets it was perfect for me, i heard the sizes were reduced but i\\'m 200ponds and xl worked for me they are amazing but i had to cut them because they were way too long fab pants!  fast service! perfect fit and really flattering!  material light weight and came out of the wash (cold gentle) just as new! great got these to replace a cheap pair of &#34;waterproof&#34; pants. these actually hold up during rain and are made with a much higher level of quality overall. patagonia does not disappoint. i was very worried when i first ordered this because i didn\\'t read the description at the bottom saying it only fits size 2 to 12. i\\'m a size 16/18, 5\\'9&#34; and these for beautifully on me! i love the pattern and the fabric :) would definitely buy again these scrubs are very nice. i like the solid colors.  the fit very nicely, however; the top is a little big compared to the bottoms, but i also have a small waist and big hips.  that\\'s the only reason why i gave this item 4 stars.  i plan on buying another pair, but a different shape for the top. =) it\\'s a perfect fit . i bought the petite medium size bc i\\'m 142 lbs & 5ft 3 inc . it never slides down , i never have to iron it the fabric is soft . i love it .<br />i also bought the grey\\'s anotomy , it kept sliding down all the time , maybe there cut is . i\\'m 5\\'7\\', 143 lbs and these are just a titch baggy in the legs but fit great otherwise . the length is great, they go all the way down and cover the top of my ankle. the material is soft and silky and thick enough that is doesn\\'t show off the not so perfect aspects of my figure . love them. the pants are very fashionable and comfortable, i would highly recommend these pants over others, the fit is very flattering and material is very nice. always perfect! been wearing nydj for over 6 years. i have several styles. always perfect for my lifestyle.  they are the first to be thrown in a suitcase as not only great looking but comfortable! awesome, awesome, awesome i wish i would have ordered multiple colors.  the fit is great and the length is good.  i was worried they would not be long enough. i\\'m 5\\'10 with a 35&#34; inseam and i was a little worried these wouldn\\'t be long enough but they\\'re the perfect length! they just barely touch the floor. i was so pleasantly surprised. they\\'re extremely comfortable and i might end up buying a second pair in a different color. soft and very comfortable. pretty thin and a bit see-through, but a good product nonetheless. this little jumper was far better than i expected it to be.....especially for the price! i\\'m 5ft 9 and it\\'s hard to find cute little jumpers that aren\\'t inappropriate for me, this fit the bill! it looks so elegant on! it\\'s not too short, or too long, the length is amazingly proportionate for someone of my height and build (i\\'m very curvy). i got the xl and it fits perfectly! so comfy and roomy, plenty of room for growth.  fits and feels a lot like victorias secret except for the price i really like the fit of these...they are a great addition to my closet ....they are true to size n the quality is great! way too cute and so light and comfy, they are great for miami\\'s weather, is always hot in here and i found my perfect pants!!! i\\'m buying more of this. i read the reviews so i ordered a size lg instead of my usual md. they fit like a glove! i have bigger legs and but but i have a small waist so these pants are a dream for me.its awesome that they can be dressed up or down. i will definitely be ordering more! only used them a couple of times so far, but i like them. they are comfortable, and they definitely make you sweat. perfect fit gorgeous, love the fit. love it!!!! i\\'m so happy i went with these.  they are very dark blue just like i wanted :)  can\\'t wait to wear them at a festival i\\'m attending next week size runs just a bit small.  but otherwise arrived promptly and will use this seller again in the future. thank you my niece really liked these. would recommend. very nice i love the fit and they are so comfortable! the quality is definitely worth the price.they are also very slimming. so in love with these i\\'m 5\\'9\\'\\' and 140 pounds and they for beautifully! would buy all of them! it was a little too small even tho i order my size but everything else is great seriously, i think i\\'ve bought about 10 pairs now. they run really, really big. (or stretch out once you put them on) so order a size or two smaller than you think you need. though they did not ship me the black pants, i was notified and asked which color i wanted instead. i chose iron grey and they fit fantastically and will be perfect for my trip to the amazon, where i will need lightweight pants to hike.<br /><br />the costumer service was amazing, and i will definitely will be purchasing from them again. it fits well. it has made up of good material, and it is a stylish dress. i would like to use it on the beach.<br /><br />when i bought this dress its delivery estimation was sometime between august 7th-23th (about one month), but it took just 10 days to deliver. they are so comfortable, and cozy. i\\'m not a tall girl, so they are a little long, but they are so soft and warm. i love them love, well made, great seller! fit good and look great and they wash and dry beautifully; no ironing necessary. also very comfortable and look good too. i really like these pants i am 5 ft 6 inches tall and weigh 125 lbs.  these leggings fit quite well.  some of the reviews discussed that the black non-sheer parts were still a bit see through, but the pair i received are not at all.  these are very cute with multiple tops, my favorite are loose, flowy batwing type shirts.  i also wore these with a corset as part of my halloween costume and they rocked!  you can wear fun patterned hose underneath and they show through the sheer part, which i really love- adds an extra layer of fun (pun intended).  love these and would certainly order again. i wear a small but i bought a medium because of the reviews. i am happy because the m was even a little tight around the legs. i really like these pants but i wish the fold-over section was an inch or two longer. :) i like how it is so comfortable and soft material. however they are more inline with european sizing so the size 18 is a bit more snug. i wish they had a bigger size as it would have been perfect for me. awesome the seller says he sent these pants, but we did not receive them.  consequently, no review of this particular sale.  however, i did buy a pair of these exact pants from walmart and love them for the gym.  great fit, comfortable, and they really do wick moisture.  i plan to buy more of them as well as the matching shirts. all items are nice thank you<br />from: tijuana b.c mexico :) these are very comfortable and light for summer wear. the fabric is good quality. i am delighted with them, and would recommend them to anyone who wants some style and comfort in their summer wardrobe. i love these, i\\'m a actually quite pleased i double clicked, having two pairs has proved a fine choice. great value for price and good value for money. these are perfect!! color, quality and price, my new fav great material, lightweight, soft, and doesn\\'t collect lint (yay!)<br />reading all the reviews about them being too small, i ordered a med (usually wear a small) but they are slightly baggy on me. conclusion: order your normal size. unless you have a wider than average middle, then you should order a size larger -- the elastic waist band is pretty snug; and you can pin up the legs. although the pot leaves on the leggings you do get are different, they\\'re still pretty cute. soft, light fabric, already washed and dried nicely, retained shape, (i wouldn\\'t p ut them in the dryer tho) look and feel as the picture love it very satisfied perfect these pants are great - they run long, which is fine by me.  the white is see-through, so if you\\'re going to go out in public and you care what people think, you\\'ll want to wear a long shirt/tunic and choose panties wisely.  i have washed these several times and they are holding up well.  i would buy these again. love these pants.  the material is very nice and comfortable.  the hem on the pant legs are unfinished, but you really cannot notice.  i am 5\\'4&#34;, so they are a bit long even with platform wedges, but well worth the money. perfect fit and a big hit for yoga class.  i would not run in them or do any super sweaty workouts in them, but they are great for teaching yoga and make people smile. even a little snug they are very nice, comfortable and fit well i bot 3 similar style different color scheme elastic leggings from three chinese vendors ( the other two are elaine accessories, surenow). this particular pair from this vendor is far superior than the other two pairs (where seams at crotch were both split wide open at the first trial )<br /><br />my jean size is 5-7, ( hip 34, waist 28). looking closely at the sewing technique, i found that the other two pairs did not have reinforcing stitches at the crotch , that\\'s why they split open easily. machine wash may trash those leggings much faster love these pants!! the fit perfectly and are extremely comfortable! i will be buying more! love love love these pants....so cute love these pants. fit a little big but the drawstring makes them just right. washed them and no &#34;pilling&#34;. very soft lightweight material. i had great luck with ordering these. love them they are true to the sizing wow ! i recieved my items before assigned date. i love my style of jeans they fir perfect. i love these pants, these are now my third pair, very comfortable, hope they keep making these & in different colors very cute! fit well on 5\\'2 /115 frame! love love love!!! the fit amazing! i\\'m 5 2 and about 125 pounds normally a size 7 and they both my girl friend and i and she\\'s a size 5. and comfy these are cute and stylish. super cute had gotten plenty of compliments soft and decent quality flannel. wash and dry without shrinking. i\\'m happy i purchased them. i checked the size chart and bought exactly my size. i\\'m 5\\'8 and weigh about 185. most of my height is in my legs so i am really happy to finally have a pair of pants that fit perfectly!! normally the hemline is at my ankle but the hemline on these pants are actually sitting on top of my foot! i bought two more pair of pants from women within and am very satisfied. amazing! im 5\\'9 and finally pants that are long! this is my second pair and won\\'t be my last! too long purchased them for my girlfriend. she thinks they are great somewhat large..but exactly what is shown in pic ...the zippers all work the pack is big enough to fit a gameboy xl or a vita which is great...the shipping is great ...will enjoy these pants for a long time they look well made ..and the designis sweet.well buy from them again repeat customer. great for wearing to work in the summer. tall sizes are true to length. these are very nice linen pants, the fabric is thick tho and they kind of look like scrubs but i like them a lot. they look very home made and were a little short. confusing review but all and all i liked them:) these pants are beautiful, especially for the price. the fit is true to size and they do fit below the navel as the picture shows. i expected the waistline to have a little more style to it but the tie in front is simple and attractive with a gathered waist that has about a 3/4\\' elastic. i am 5\\'3\\'\\' and i will have to trim the bottoms but it will go unnoticed as the pants have a very wide flair. love these pants nice looking piece at great price.. i like them, they are cute, but i bought a size xl based on the other comments made and i wished i had just gotten a large. i will order another pair in large next time. love them lots of complements on these pants.. work at a school an all girls ask where i got them. i loved the softness of these pjs though they are for my daughter i am not sure how well made they are but seemed to be great quality and the pjs were shipped in time for christmas. thanks super comfy but run a bit big- stretchy and nice,  cuffs are not sewed up but loose  enough to adjust very comfortable i love it so comfy!! very nice casual loose fit  pants, i will get another pair. i bought one size bigger to make sure it fitted and it was just perfect. these pants are very comfortable. i will buy another pair or two in different colors. [[videoid:cbac08fb90b31151e6b8ea63ded39ffa]]✏️ quick thoughts to supplement my video demonstration.<br /><br />i do quite a bit of mountaineering (just guided a trip up mt rainier last month), and i am very particular about the clothes i wear.  for cold weather mountaineering (in the pnw, that would be late sept through early may), i would definitely wear there pants.<br /><br />i would also recommend using these pants for skiing, especially if you\\'re out all day in dry, cold powder.<br /><br />i would not suggest using these as a shell (they\\'re not designed to be fully water proof, like a gortex shell). so if you\\'re expecting a ton of rain, go with some waterproof pants.<br /><br />the breathability is fantastic, and the fabric is slightly stretchy so it makes walking very easy.<br /><br />the fleece line is very soft, warm and doesn\\'t itch at all.  i really like the reinforced areas that get hit with the most snow.  i also like the slim fit (compared to the saggy-type hiking pants).  the slim fit keeps the leg cuff away from my crampons when i walk.<br /><br />if you\\'re curious i got xxxl and i\\'m fairly skinny (6\\'1\\\\\\\\\" and 170lbs.  size 32 waist.). it fits beautifully.<br /><br />note: i was given a sample of this product in exchange for a review and demonstration.<br />hope this helps!<br /><br />📍 bottom line: would i recommend this product to one of my friends?<br />👍 yes, absolutely. great pj\\'s great buy. fits great, cozy comfort and launders well. the leggings fit well, i got my normal size of medium (i\\'m 5\\'7&#34;). they are a bit see through in the butt region, but i expected that. i can\\'t say enough about these palazzo pants.  they are the most comfortable pants ever made.  they just have that wow factor.  you can wear them casual or dress them up for an evening out.  i have about 10 pair of them now and still find a new and fun pair every time i look online.  definitely worth the price.  the feel of the fabric against my skin is amazing. very comfortable.  i am 6 ft. tall with a 34 in. waist and they fit well.  the ankle bands were uncomfortably snug so i snipped the bands and now the pants legs hang free and are much more comfortable. they are so shinny! they look as great and colorful on as they do in the picture. the material is a bit thin but not bad, and they are not see through at all on me and look great!! these pants are awesome for the price!  they fit well, look pretty sweet, and are really comfy for meditation and yoga practices.  i\\'ll probably buy another patterned pair in the future this is what i wanted and been looking for. excellent service, came promptly, i will be a returning customer. happy with everything most pants are too long on me because i\\'m only 5\\' tall so they are about 6&#34; too long on me. i purchased these pants to lounge around the house and they didn\\'t disappoint me. they are soft and very comfortable. i would buy again. beautiful red color! i\\'m tall so these are not as long on me as they are in the stock photos on that girl. lol definitely will be wearing these soon! bought these as an add on with an order andi love them! going to order some more if they come in different colors!! these i got for my mom, she says they are super comfortable and that the waistband is soft an wide so that it does not settle into love handles fits great!!!! these are so comfortable, i must get another in a different color pattern. they feel so soft, fit fantastically, and this blue&white pattern conceal the not so great parts of my legs! i use them for dance class as well as relaxing in them. these are well made grade &#34;a&#34; for awesome! i wear these all the time and they are so comfy. if you are tall they will fit you like capri pants bigger thank expected but the most comfortable pants i own. will definitely be buying more. i love these pants! they are so comfortable, the fit is flattering, and the length is great, especially since they come in tall sizes (no more highwaters for me) excellent length, great fit. glad i ordered a size larger. but these are great and i love them! perfect for lounging around. nice even after washing, these were somewhat larger than i expected.  they are very long waisted.  i needed the longer inseam, but not the longer waist.  still, for slugging around the house on a cold day, they are fine, and i love the deep side pockets.  good product.  if in doubt, order a size smaller. these pants are the same color as freed pointe shoes! peachy-pink, which i love!! about the quality, if would be nice if they placed some sort of label for the back.  however, if your mother never taught you how to tell the front or back of a pair of pants, google it.  the factory should take more time to snip the ends, instead of leaving threads, but for this price, just take some cuticle scissors and snip the ends. the pants have a full lining that resembles shorts.  the same as the skirts that are popular now with the short slip and then the long see through skirt.  wear proper underwear and you will be fine.  i love these finds like these pants!  inexpensive and i don\\'t look like everyone else in my small town! put a denim jacket and tank top- cute! good quality and fit, after one wash were soft and comfortable.<br />love the extra pocket on the thigh.<br />i am 5\\'8 170lbs. i\\'m very large chested so its hard to find scrubs that don\\'t make me look huge all over, these fit well. fantastic pants. super comfy and soft material. great colors and pattern. fast shipping and item was as described! i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; 120 lbs and small fit perfect in the butt area and i say that because i have a small butt. anyone with more meat lol should probably go a size up. the length is long which is fine because it only took a min to hem them on my machine. all in all, i really like these and will buy this brand again. very comfortable. great choice for tall people. i\\'m 5\\'10 and they are a perfect length for my long legs. good quality and wear great for the price exactly what i wanted. i will be ordering more. thanks love them! this are super cute! word to the wise, though, the pleather isn\\'t breathable. you may find yourself sweating as though you\\'re wearing plastic on the front. fits nice i love these pants...i bought so many colors it\\'s crazy! these pants fit well & feel so nice.  i\\'m sensitive/allergic to so many clothes, but all the cottonique products feel wonderful against my skin. first opening these pants they were a little rough but after i washed them they are fine.  very happy with them and will probably order more! a bit shinny, but nice i was skeptical about how this jumper would fit since i am almost 6ft tall and anything that is long enough for the average size person never works out the same for me. as expected after the first wash and line dry the 1/2 inch i need to keep at my ankle was lost. even still, it looks cute placed at capri length also. my only gripe is this is a very thin material and the pocket tore on the first day. luckily i have a sewing machine but it was a bit of a let down. i choose the size 2 as i am normally anywhere between a 0 and that, the product is a bit snug in the thigh region, so heads up on that. thick material very cute just runs a lil small exellent these are awesome yoga pants for the price! a little longer than expected, but otherwise quite nice. these pants are pretty comfortable. the first time after washing they fit snug, but stretch really quickly. the rear pockets are a little funny, but after sewing them down so they don\\'t flap up and stick straight out on the butt, they are fine. they seem to be pretty true to size and the quality is good enough for only wearing them a few months. all ok nice pants. good light weight for spring after reading the reviews i ordered an xl and they fit perfect. i\\'m usually a m size 6 so i ordered the xl. i made sure the color i ordered was &#34;prime shipping&#34; so it came from the amazon fulfillment center not china. that way shipping was quick and i could return if needed. i got them in 2 days. it wasn\\'t my first choice for color, but better than waiting weeks and not able to return. exactly what i hoped for.  very natural and comfortable. it fits snug and keeps its shape when washed and dried. i am 5\\'4 and 125lb. i ordered the small petite at first.  they were too big/baggy so i exchanged them for xs petite which works great.  if i roll down the top which i prefer they may become a bit too short on the bottom when sitting.  i\\'m border line for the regular length.<br /><br />i love these scrubs.  they look more like pants.  love the pockets.  they seem durable and wear well. they look great.  i\\'m a massage therapist so i move around a lot and these are very comfortable.<br /><br />i will say they can get pretty warm. not as breathable as other scrubs or yoga pants.<br /><br />overall,  i will buy more. like the material and fit. it fits perfectly i would purchase again these are the most comfortable pants ever! these are very cute! the material is a little cheap, but with the right top, shoes & accessories you can dress it up. the only reason i am not giving this 5 stars is because it does give a camel toe if you wear them too high up. the pants are very straight so if you are super curvy, i would not recommend. i bought an extra small. 5ft, 95lbs. they fit well except the occasional &#34;ct&#34; i usually wear a medium but these were a little smaller than expected. however, i must say that i got them in a timely manner, the color is spot on and the design is exactly as the picture shows. i love these. would order again only in a large :) i bought these in black and purple. the purple is especially pretty in color. these are not for petite women. i like them enough that i will have them hemmed, up to three inches or so. love these!!!!!  i get so many compliments! these are soooo comfortable and flattering!  i love them.  great for all seasons! this is a great product. i use it for my cycling class and it helps keep me comfy. what i expected one size leggings can be a blessing or a curse.  i recently bought anther brand and was sp disappointed.  i bought 2 pair of the amour and waited.  first off, i didn\\'t know they were shipping from overseas but they got here quick.  second, i was very, very happy with the fit and quality.  let\\'s face t, for around $10 i don\\'t expect high end leggings.  but these fit well and the patterns are so unique and just plain cute!<br /><br />for reference, i am 5\\'7&#34; and am a size 8/10 on the bottom.  i have thickish legs but these fit fine.  i like the so much i am going to buy more! i love the skirt. great material but sort of large. i wear a size 2-4 and ordered a small. i wish the skirt came in x-small. they are great 😍😍 a bit longer than i expected, but thats a quick fix. i\\'m looking forward to traveling with them - very comfortable! they are comfy and wife really enjoys. they are just a little long on shorter people. these pants are a great fit at a fantastic price. i did have to get them altered, but the price is still worth it for joie. i love these, they\\'re so comfortable and they look great.<br />- however a month in the stitching on the outer side started to come undone (so after 4 washes, cause i would wear them like once a week). bought this for my daughter for christmas and she absolutely loves them.  she said they are very comfortable and the hummingbirds (her favorite bird) were an extra bonus. couldn\\'t be happier with this purchase and to bring a smile to my daughter\\'s face! was too long but i got it adjusted these are super soft and well made.  the color is true to the photo as are the pants themselves.  very nice! color:  1vp76_black & pink  - i bought the large size palazzo pants. they are a perfect fit - not too loose or too tight. i am 5\\'10&#34;, 180 lbs. i think these are about a 33&#34; inseam. i could\\'ve used just one more inch, but they are long enough. just not so super long to me like everyone else says - but my height makes me have a bit of a different perception. .the edges are hemmed (some other brands like g2 chick come unhemmed). the material is soft and silky. hangs fantastically. looks really nice. you don\\'t have to worry about these being see-thru. they are dark enough and, because of the pattern, doesn\\'t show panty lines either. they are so comfy, and i got a lot of compliments on them. definitely worth the price charged.  i used the free standard shipping, and it arrived in less than 5 days!! perfect base layer for skiing.  i ski hard, but riding the chairs sometimes makes me cold. these are my new favorite pants! they are so comfortable, incredibly flattering, and just gorgeous. i pair mine with a simple tank top, rope necklace, and wedge sandals. these pants are so cute.  first off the pocket on the back and side pockets have a cool floral pattern to them.  the extra thick stitches on the top of the blue part of the leg is just the nicest touch.  boho chic!  the fit is just so loose and comfy.  i\\'m 5\\'10\\' and 130 pounds and they fit very similar to the photo.  they are a little shorter but i just wear them across my hips instead of at the waist as shown.  machine washed them and laid them flat to dry and they turned out perfectly. comfy!!!!!!!!! that\\'s all you need to know :) o..... and really long i\\'m 5\\'7 and these are a good 2 inches longer than my legs, but i don\\'t care, why? comfy!!!! just got my leggings in. took a couple weeks, but i was expecting such since they came from china. previous reviews described that they look a little transparent when actually worn, and they do. i wouldn\\'t wear these without shorts or a skirt. being 5\\'6&#34; and 165lbs (pant size 10/12), i was worried i wouldn\\'t fit in them at all since more of the trendy patterns i find are made for women of my height but a fair 20-30lbs slimmer. the leg length fits just fine; not too tight - the ankles are actually quite loose. my only problem is the typical one i have with leggings: they don\\'t pull up high enough in the rear, and they tend to slide down when i sit. for the price, i can deal. my girlfriend ordered these and originally they sent the wrong item but they sent a new one at no charge! she loves them and says they are really comfy. i was pleasantly surprised when i received these leggings they are classy  very pretty love them a lot perfect for the lake! great, comfortable fit. (a bit long for me, so i will need to hem them) i love these legging! the only thing i have to say is that the diamonds on the front are much larger. the material is very high quality, and the pants are well made. makes my butt feel soft the fit is a bit larger than i expected, but still fits. i wear mine to work now and my boss can\\'t tell the difference with a long shirt and sweater, so comfy and they fit perfect. i can wear them with heels and they still work perfect for business casual. love love love it<br />comfortable, light and airy. love grey\\'s scrubs. great price. great fit. perfect shipped very quickly, what more can you say about cat leggings. product was as described and will go well with my outfit i need them for good i\\'m satisfied with this uniform. i have been very pleased with the pants that i ordered.  i would have ordered the shirts, but they were not available in my size.<br /><br />i think that some people indicated that they run small, but i usually wear a 3x.  i ordered the 2x because that\\'s all that was available.  i found that these were perfectly acceptable, and i had no issue with the size.<br /><br />they are very comfortable, and i like the little lace at the bottom.  they fit nicely under pants and such, but i tend to wear them at night when i am very cold with a large shirt over them to bed. good quality not great for xl great, comfy and very flattering!! i\\'ll probably buy another pair since i\\'ve been wearing it everyday. definitely worth the price. so cute.  i\\'ve been inactive due to illness and wanted something easy to sit around in.  these are comfy,and cute and easy wash and wear,  i should have bought 2! very very long and very big sizes. you might want to order a size down from your usual. i like it this is the most comfortable pant i have ever worn, it fits so well and is really flattering for my shape.<br />thanks, i love it!! arrived within 4 days, fit great, beautiful color this pants are super cute and comfy - i love the fact that there are so many pockets. the pocket on the rear has a velcro closure, there are the two cargo-style pockets, standard hip pockets and the nice little pen loop (although not a pocket) on the back. these are very comfortable. i\\'m 5\\'5 and ordered a petite which are just long enough to give about an inch (maybe less) of space between the floor and the end of the pant leg (with shoes on). the material isn\\'t too swishy. i will say that i think boot leg is a little misleading. there isn\\'t much shape to the pant leg (it is all pretty loose) so don\\'t expect a more fitted leg with a little boot flare. other than that, these are a pretty great scrub pant. i never knew the point of product reviews if the description wasnt helpful to others.... so i\\'m going to try to do this so that others know exactly what they are getting. i love these pants. i ordered the new royal in size x-small. i am 5\\'3\\\\\\\\\" and 128lbs. the small would have been way too big, baggy and long in the leg department. the x-small fits perfectly on my waist, any smaller and i may not have been able to bend over. they are a \\\\\\\\\"cozy\\\\\\\\\" fit around my butt and hips which i prefer cause i dont like my scrubs baggy and hanging off me like im wearing a bedsheet.  if you have a more cushion-y booty and hips that don\\'t lie, i would order a small. ;) they are a little long and i have to roll the top of the pants once but thats no big whoop to me. the bottoms are flare with a slit on the side. the material is sooo soft and when i put them on it felt like i didnt have any pants on!! haha!! there are no back pockets but you have a side pocket and two normally placed pockets. the top of these are elastic on the backside and drawstring on the frontside. i was hoping that the new royal would match my \\\\\\\\\"cherokee royal scrub top\\\\\\\\\" and it did, perfectly. i will definitely be buying more of these scrubs and when i purchase a \\\\\\\\\"top\\\\\\\\\" i will write a review for that too. i wanted to add, which i forgot when i originally wrote this is that there is a pocket in the back. just one. and when i order more, i will be ordering the x-small petite, for i had ordered the x-small regular and i have to roll them which i said earlier was okay but now wearing them i realize that they are still too long. i don\\'t agree at all with the negative comments. these leggings are soo comfortable. they are a bit short on me, but i do have long legs (btw i am 5\\'5, 105lbs). they fit nicely otherwise. others were complaining that there was no elastic in the waistband but that is not an issue for me - i would rather they be comfortable than too tight. i did notice the smell that others complained about, but it wore off in a matter of a couple hours after taking them out of the package. there is no trace of a smell left and i haven\\'t washed them yet. so far i have been wearing them for about  8 hours and there is no pilling of the fabric. i wish i had these leggings earlier in the season instead of wearing my practically see through ones from forever 21! if anyone is uncertain about purchasing this product, don\\'t be! i\\'ve got a number of pairs of leggings, but the softness of the cotton on these really blew me away. i also loved that the camo pattern is very true to the picture - sometimes the colors can be too bright, and i was shooting for a very neutral, heavy-on-the-olive-green kinda thing, so this was perfect.<br /><br />i\\'d say these are of a medium heft, with which i was pleased, and that the waistband is the typical elastic common to leggings.<br /><br />they\\'re a nice material, and don\\'t get that odd fade-out of color in areas that get a little stretch, which is wonderful.<br /><br />i\\'d very, very highly recommend these! if it helps anyone: i am 5\\'3&#34; and 140lbs. with rather long legs for my height, and these were plenty lengthy enough. nice i bought these pants based on the positive reviews, but was a bit apprehensive about the style.  i figured at the price, why not give them a shot?  i\\'m so glad that i did.  these pants are so cute!!<br /><br />i am a bit bottom heavy so the fashion world tells me to stay away from harem pants, but the fashion world is dead wrong!  these particular pants are not low in the crotch like most harem pants, so they don\\'t shorten the legs much.  they can be worn lower or higher on the waist, and can be dressed up or down.  i have very thick, athletic thighs, and this style is super slimming, which i would never expect.  these give me a wonderful, curvy, kardashian-esque look.  i thought that i would have to wear these with heels all the time, but they are very flattering and look good with flats as well.  i do have to wear spanx or tights with them, though, as the material is very thin, slinky, and shiny, which shows off every little dimple of cellulite.  otherwise, they feel like pajamas and i look forward to replacing my jeans with these pants as much as possible this fall/winter season.<br /><br />as other reviewers mentioned, these run small, so be sure to order a larger size.  i have a 25&#34; waist and 38&#34; hips, and the extra large fits perfectly (they would fit on a slightly larger frame, but probably a size 6 or 8 at the largest).  i love, love, love these pants. as you have probably read in other reviews, do order a size larger than you normally would. i am usually a medium, ordered a large and they fit perfectly. the seam down the front middle is a little awkward at first, but with some readjusting, the suit looks great! i work outdoors and am in very good shape, however, i am curvy and it has been difficult finding work pants that stand the test. i love these pants.  definitely buying a few more. nice fit, came in earlier  than expected  as well. nice leggings, thin but not to thin i\\'m 5,6 and they are a little bit to short not like on a model not at all . i\\'m 117 lbs bought size small and they are a little bit to big on me so i would say that they are thru to size alittle small for me...but fast delivery very light weight and comfy! fit good order your size!!! so cute! fits a bit loose but great quality and sit what you want from pjs very comfy. have bought 4 pairs in different colors. unbelievably comfortable.... and just straight up fresh.  out of around 10 palazzo pants in my closet to choose from.... these are the ones i wear the most.  really alot of leeway on what you can do at the top... ive worn them with several different shades of nicer blouses, as well as my favorite babydoll tees and tank tops.  trust me you will be sooooo happy that you got them.  i got mine in medium and i probably could have gotten away with the small but i like my palazzos to have just about as much room in the thigh as the calf... so there ya go... i am 5\\'3 1/2 and weigh around 125.  aquas, baby blues, navys lavendars, pale yellows... black... white... you\\'ll have a hard time finding something that doesnt either match or go perfectly well with em.  do yourself a big ole favor and get you these babies!!! excelente great length, shiny material without looking cheap, super stretchy and looks good with just about anything. my only complaint is that occasionally i have to pull them up around my waist, if i don\\'t they bunch around my knees...but that may be do to my short stature. as an owner of many pets, i was looking for a material that would not attract fur and these are perfect. i wore them to work under a shirt dress and got tons of compliments. great value for the price. i will definitely be ordering more colors!! liked shows panty line though have to wear right under garments love this outfit....the only drawback is that the bottom is a bit see through.  fortunately for me it was purchased for a evening party. i was very happy with them . they fit as i expected. i actually ordered a second pair. i was expected the size s may be a little bit tight from what everyone wrote in reviews. instead, it was a little bigger, which is ok to me because the material of this pants is not stretchy. (5\\'4&#34; 110lb asian: small) i like them because they felt really good to wear. that is why i had bought three of them for my self love the material of these pants, you can dress them up or down. these are one of my favorite purchases. i am 115 lbs, 5\\' 5\\'\\' and usually wear us s or 2. i ordered s/27 for these pants and they are a perfect fit!<br />i\\'ve been looking for thinner material for cargo pants for a while now since most pants i saw on amazon are made of thicker heavier material. these pants are ideal for hot miami weather.<br />i also like the overall look and feel of these pants with a lot of pockets and design elements like stitches in the front and a zipper over the left front pocket.<br /><br />regards,<br />alex these tights are super cute! i love them! the colors are as pictured. they are super soft and fit well. i\\'m 5\\'5 118lbs. they are a little long (i have a 30&#34; inseam, so most pants are long on me). will buy more tights from this seller in the future! a little looser than i\\'d expected but super comfortable and good.  wish the waist band was a little firmer. i love these pants, they are super comfy but nice enough for work.  the length fit me great, i\\'m just shy of 5\\' 7&#34;, but if you\\'re too much shorter you might want to at least wear them with heals or platform sandals. i love these pants, they are great. comfortable, good color for the summer. the only thing is they run small. i usually wear size small, but i bought medium. they fit me well. i recommend these pants to everybody. i had never heard of ponte pants until i had the opportunity to review them and i really love them!  ponte is a type of knit fabric.  the ponte pants are stretchy.  worn tighter, they could be leggings.<br /><br />bodisure\\'s ponte pants are generous at the waist and have tapered ankles.  i really loved how i didn\\'t feel bound in my pants when sitting down.  i felt better with a longer shirt, because the pants didn\\'t hold my tummy in.  they have a thin permanent raised crease down both the front and back of the ponte pants giving them a more formal look.<br /><br />the pants have two small horizontal zippered pockets to put small items.  i put my cough drops in them, but they wouldn\\'t accommodate my mike-pack for me to hear the band.  but, because the waistband didn\\'t bind, i could put the mike-pack in my waistband.<br /><br />bodisure\\'s ponte pants come in sizes 14/16, 18/20, and 22/24.  i ordered the 22/24, afraid that they would be too small, but i was wrong.  they fit me really well.  you might consider ordering a size smaller than you\\'d normally wear.<br /><br />bodisure\\'s ponte pants are machine washable, so you won\\'t be running to the dry cleaner.  the fabric is advertised to keep its shape and not pill.<br /><br />whether you wear your ponte pants as legging or as pants, you\\'ll look fabulous in both casual and more formal settings.<br /><br />i received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. i love these. i am a size 10 and the large fits perfect. i am happy these are not see through at all. these leggings were delivered in a timely manner and well packaged. i absoultely love them!!! i\\'m considereing buying another pair. i have worn them 3 times so far and i receive compliments every time! super sexy and of good quality. i read a review that the leggings ripped as soon as they put them on? well all i can say to that is of course you must be a bit more gentle when you put them on, as you do not want to rip or tear any of the sheer fabric the same way you would not just \\\\\\\\\"roughly\\\\\\\\\" put on sheer stockings. once they are on however, they are very strong and able to do pretty much anything! i would absolutely reccomend!! super comfy excelente.. love it! wish i could order more. these are exactly what i was looking for, good fit, material isn\\'t too thin, and available in a billion colors :)<br /><br />i\\'m 5\\'5\\\\\\\\\" 130lbs and the small fits perfect! (and my hips are a tad wide) they hug all the right places and flare out just the right amount at the bottom. they arent super long but the small should definitely fit even if you\\'re a few inches taller than me. not sure why some people thought they were see-thru, maybe they bought the light light heather grey ones, or they are old reviews and the quality has improved? i bought the black-on-black and was able to do all sorts of yoga and pilates with no see-thru bending over problems at all (and i bought them figuring they\\'d be at least a tad sheer stretched over these hips)... i\\'m buying more colors for sure! i love these pants! love these shorts. the high waist is very stylish and the print is cool too. extremely comfortable.  moves easily and gracefully. i love the pants would like to have another pair soon these pants are really comfortable but sometimes the way it rolls down is annoying and have to keep fixing it. but definitely recommend! good product this is my absolute favorite set of scrub pants!! so soft and so comfortable and very true to size!! buying many more in all colors!! the pants arrived a lot sooner than expected. i love the color and pattern. i will need to have the pants altered. i\\'m 5\\'1 and they\\'re about 8 inches too long. my measurments are waist 31inches, and hips 37 inches. they are a bit snug in the waist. i got a medium, and wish i would have gotten a large. slightly larger waist than expected...but absolutely love them!! these are great comfy pants for great everyday use! they are a bit tighter than i expected, but the length is great! they are good quality material as well. i usually find yoga pants that are too short, and these are just right! plus, i love the choice of colors!! i bought these pants for a trip to the beach. they have a stylish wide leg look and are very light weight- perfect for summer. they fit well and can be easily rolled at the top if needed.i like the full panel maternity pants and was a little worried these might not be as comfortable but they are incredibly comfortable. there is a drawstring to tighten them if needed as well. i am 5\\' 4\\'\\' and they are a little long on me. i have washed them once (on delicate) and they have held up well- i\\'m always concerned about that with gauze. at this price i will be purchasing these pants in additional colors! i love this beautiful and comfortable purchased this for my wife. she said it had a great fell and fit except a little long...very pretty pants...buy um love love my new cargo pants, thinking about ordering a 2nd pair. their real cute and stylish! amazing quality.  love it! my go to jeans for a flattering fit. comfy and not too long this is one of the cutest shirt and short set i own and i have to say i was pretty worried about what i was going to receive since there were no reviews. this fits me the way it fits on the model in the picture. the shirt and shorts are long but it is supposed to be baggy. i didn\\'t see the little bow next to one of the ears in the picture and when i saw it i thought it was so cute. the print of the front is the white rabbit from alice in wonderland and it says &#34;the white rabbit&#34; i believe. i have it at home so i think that\\'s what it says ^~^<br /><br />great buy. these are a great investment. they are as comfortable as the expensive cycling shorts, they wash beautifully, and fit great, protecting all the necessary parts. follow the size suggestions. you can\\'t beat the price i bought four pair for the price of one mid-range cycling short. love these love the feel and fit, very comfortable these pants are comfortable and very stylish. love the look and style. you can dress them up or down. don\\'t be afraid of fashion. simple cover up. fun and different i am in love with these maxi-skirts, they are so comfortable and breathable.  perfect for summer and they are slimming too! i love the versatility with the colors/patterns also,  you can mix and match tops to go with these skirts!  easy to dress up or dress down, depending on your shirt and accessories. excellent my hips are about 35 inches and this size fit me perfectly. they are comfortable and i am able to ride with hours. omg, these pants are amazing.  comfy and flattering!  they are a little long (and i\\'m 5\\'11), but the bottom is unfinished, so you can cut to the length you need without fraying.  so happy with these! these are great  kick-around pants but the fold-over stretches way out.  unless you can sew and take big tucks, you will be constantly pulling them up. fits somewhat small around butt and thighs this ensemble is a perfect base layer for underneath an outfit.  fits true to size, the material is thin woven, yet warm.  there is a good level of stretch to the fabric blend and the initial minimal itchiness becomes softer with washing.  very happy to have found this wonderful product.  compared to 100% silk these seem more breathable and will keep the wearer warmer. i look dope. very comfy. i needed them for a costume and they worked well. fit was just fine. i love these pants! i bought a charcoal grey pair at costco about six months ago, and i love them. as often happens at costco, you go back to buy more, only to find that they no longer carry that item. i was so happy to find them on amazon! i have had two surgeries in the past six months, and i have been spending a lot of time laying around at home in recovery. these pants are so soft and warm. i\\'m usually a small, but i sized up to the medium, as i like my pajamas more loose fitting. i\\'m so glad to have a second pair of these! i wish there were even more colors available! thanks ... my product arrived safely! it\\'s a beautiful product well constructed, and fit is perfect for my body type.  thick fabric that will hold up well. i love the material of these pants, not see through but still light. i\\'m a size 4 so i was a little nervous of the one size fits all but they fit fine for me and the waist band is very comfy cool pants but i squat soooo... ive got big legs! love that pant though. i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; and 100 lbs, and i ordered a medium since i have wider than normal hips (small tush, though). these are a little long for me, but otherwise fit perfectly. the print is great, and i always get a lot of compliments when i wear them around. great buy! they\\'re essentially work-appropriate pajama pants.  what\\'s not to love? looks just like the pic and fits me nice too but it took a lil while for me to get it the fit was perfect. as a large woman i half expected the pants to fit just a bit too tight but they were perfect. form fitting where they needed to be and loose around the legs. the colors are vibrant and three washes in the color and fit are just as they were on day one. i am very pleased and would suggest these and have suggested these to a friend. i really like the material it feels strong. don\\'t like all the thread in some areas sticking out. other than that it fits great and all the pockets are awesome for work. will be ordering other colors. retro and fun! decent quality, fit well, came quickly! just what i was looking for. super soft and comfy to wear around the house, but still looks nice and flattering for if friends stop by. a little &#34;classier&#34; than the standard yoga pants and definitely look better with my postpartum body shape. the length is great too - i\\'m 5\\'7 with a pretty even torso/leg length and this are just a smidge past floor length. they shrink up a bit when washed, but i can easily stretch them back out.<br /><br />i originally ordered the black and charcoal in xl because i didn\\'t want any squeezing/muffin top going on (thanks to my mom tummy), and they fit great out of the package and after being washed, but then they stretch out as you wear them and they were falling off of me.<br /><br />so i ordered burgundy and navy in l, thinking if they fit well, i\\'d reorder and black and charcoal in the smaller size since i wanted all four colors eventually. so glad i got the smaller size. i wouldn\\'t say they run big in general, as they\\'ll fit true to size when you first put them on, but they do stretch and become larger. these are snug when i first put them on, and then fit how i like after wearing for about an hour. the panel is also a great size - long enough to fold over as intended, but short enough that you could leave it up without it looking like full panel maternity pants. happy! if you wear m, order l and it will fit perfect (it might still feel a bit small)<br /><br />i would advise ordering two size up though. these pants are incredible! i believe they are the most comfortable pants i have ever worn. since i can only stand wearing soft and comfortable clothing due to chronic pain, that is really saying something! they fit beautifully, i wear a size 14-16 loose fit. not only are they incredibly comfortable, they are very good looking on! i\\'ve received many compliments on them already. they are not see-through at all to me, as many palazzo pants turn out to be. i also love the fact they are made in the u.s.a. the style is such that they can be dressed up or down as well, a big bonus in my opinion! i feel confident and comfortable when wearing these, and will definitely be purchasing more. comfortable clothes. diffinantly a hot outfit for a fun night out i was looking for some new pants since i had lost weight, when i saw these i was attracted to the bright colors. so i ordered a few of them and was even more impressed them when arrived they looked like the colors in the pictures. they are easy to get into and take off and look great on me. always love my koi i bought these for my husband to wear while doing his martial arts katas. now i need to get him some more because he wears them all the time! he loves these things. they fit well and have lots of moving room. my husband is 5\\'10&#34; and they are a good length for him but may be short for taller people. the only downside might be that they recommend hand washing. a minor inconvenience to me for him to be so happy with them. originally sold at costco, loved them, lost some weight and then could not find them anywhere except on amazon at a great price.  these pants are wonderful as you can dress them up for work or dress them down for casual. these are surprisingly flattering. they look like skinny jeans but are way more soft and comfortable. the pockets and zip are a nice touch and there\\'s no need to cover your bottom with long shirts like with leggings. disclaimer: i got a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. first of all i am 5\\'3 and 3/4 weighing at 143lbs. i have never bought scrubs online before so i was hesitant to make the purchase. but i am a prime amazon customer and i seem to be buying everything on here so i said hey why not? i have bought these pants koi 701 lindsey scrub pants (medium petite) along with the koi 247 women\\'s nicole top (medium). i think the fit is perfect. and both shirt and pants match together! i like the adjustable bottoms. i always read the reviews on here so i wanted to make sure the next person read my review as helpful. ( i have already written a review on the shirt with a similar review in case you read the reviews for the shirt as well.) i love these pants! but i wish they had an extra small, the legs are just a little too long and they\\'re a little too big. but other than that i absolutely love them! i bought the camo pants and loved them. they are the perfect fit, (buy 1 size larger, as they run small) but these are made of a much heavier material, still cute and do like them but not as much as the camp pants i bought from the same company. soft and comfortable!!!. sometimes it is hard to buy clothes online because you never know if it will fit right. this product fit me, i follow the size chart and i was able to picked the right size for me. i love brilliant color love them this is a really cute outfit, and it fit me as expected. however, it took four weeks to arrive! it also came two separate breast pads that i am still not sure what to do with. love!! i get comments on them all the time. buy them!! as others have mentioned, these are super small. it\\'s rare for me to find adult clothing that is too small for me, but a few pounds heavier and i wouldn\\'t be able to fit into these things (i am 5\\'3&#34; 110lbs and got a small). also, the button hole was stitched shut and i have to cut it open which was a minor annoyance. overall though, i like them and they look super cute on. i love the pants! really cute for non &#34;brand name&#34; scrubs. best yoga pants these pants are definitely better than what i expected. they are a little long but i can make it work. i\\'m between a 1-2, slightly tall. they fit snugg and i can still roll them up if i choose to. the knees are very narrow. i confess i don\\'t do yoga in them so perhaps that is how they are supposed to be cut, but that part seemed a little too exaggerated.  the fabric is also very thin.  it is good that it breathes, and perhaps that is what you\\'re looking for, but i didn\\'t like it.  they are very stretchy though, and are just as tall and sized around the waist as i expected. perfect fit and very soft! i do really like these pants.  i would live in them if i could just order more.  the fit is a bit larger than the size chart (which for some of us is not a bad thing).  i found these pants to be quality material and made well.  easy to dress them up and very comfortable.  i will continue to check so to order more. i ordered a size up because one of the reviews said they ran extra small. well that was not the case for me, i should had ordered the small instead of medium. i kept them anyway. if you are slim please order the size you use for leggings. very cute and comfortable! love love these pants!! i received them super super fast!!! will be ordering from this company again!!! thanks! after weeks of purchasing i finally received my order; i thought the large would have fitted more snug, the pants fitted, the top a bit too loose, but i think i would try a medium next time. i can still exercise in it; the fabric is just what i wanted for easy movement! perfect transaction and communication. i contacted the seller a couple of times with some questions and the response was quick and acurate. the pants look fabulous and the fabric is wonderful. will definitey buy another pair for next year.. i tried the xxs(american)/ medium (asian) size and fits a somewhat large, but good considering the base layer that must fit under. i\\'ve used these pants for both ice climbing and skiing, and love that they have lots of stretch in it. after i ordered these from amazon in the khaki/beige,i read the reviews and i thought oh no-they are going to be much too tiny!<br />they do look tiny, but are made to stretch, much like riding pants.<br />they fit fine, even surprisingly long enough for my 34.5\\\\\\\\\" long inseam!<br />i am pleased! gave a 5 star!<br />i even ordered the last pair they had in my size, though it was the darker color, that is fine as it is hard to find pants/leggings long enough for my legs!<br />the material is very soft and has much stretch.<br />the construction seems pleasingly excellent.<br />metal zipper and button.<br />great product for the price! great for travel.  easy to fold and won\\'t wrinkle. i love these leggings and all the other lysses i have.  how could something so comfortable also have that much tummy control? just got these.. and love them! the only reason for only 4stars is that the coloring is different than expected - much brighter. still do love them tho. just going to have to reassess what to wear with them! they are quite small.. especially the waist. i worried that i may not fit into them at first, but found they stretch well, and actually did fit quite well.. and kind of spanxed in my lil wobbly bits.. a good thing!  these are so fun and just adorable! ordered this late but arrived very timely. the pants are stiff at first but after washing(as another customer said) they soften up. thanks great time-out pants, i use them to lounge in after work. perfect boho received my pants quickly and i love them! color true to pictures ( i ordered a black pair and a blue pair) they fit as expected and they\\'re extremely soft. would definitely purchase again. great very nice. excellent customer service. exactly what i expected. i love wearing comfortable clothes around the house and not just pajamas. i find that i\\'m more productive in the day if i\\'m getting dressed as if i\\'m leaving the house then in my lounging clothes.  with that said these pants are perfect! they offer the luxury of looking put together and extremely comfortable!  the fabric is very light and breathable. they have a fold over waist that fits me perfectly and is true to size.  they\\'re tighter at the waist and flare out at the legs.  the pants have a wide leg flare that looks sort of like palazzo pants.  they\\'re different from my normal wardrobe but i have to say that these have become one of my favorite pairs of pants to wear.  i got a black color and i love the way they look and feel. they\\'re not cheaply made with poor stitching.  the yoga pants are perfect for running errands and keeping a put together look even when you\\'re lounging at home.  the pants are a bit long on me. i\\'m a little over 5\\'3 so i will be getting these hemmed because i really do love them!  complimentary sample provided in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. they are really nice leggings. but it has to be hemmed and the small short note that came with the pants say t;hey are marked and you just put a sheet of paper under the leg and cut them off at the proper mark through the paper.  i do not see any marks and i have looked and looked.  i will figure out a way to hem them and then they will look great. these are so comfortable, i wish i could afford several more pairs, but they cost too much.  that\\'s my only complaint.  i think they will wear out pretty fast.  they fit right and look great, and like i said are so comfortable. these leggings are beautiful!! i wasn\\'t expecting a shiny legging but i loved it anyway. i\\'m a medium size and it fits perfectly. i would recommend blue color but not the white one... the shiny material doesn\\'t look as beautiful as it looks  in white color, that\\'s why i\\'m rating 4 stars instead of 5. my favorite leggings now. im 16 and i have weight issues amd these fit great they arent see through so i dont feel like theyre too stretched out. they\\'re perfect! they have a very nice fit and are very comfortable. the waist can adjust in height and this is very nice, love these pants.  i ordered in several other colors along with the tops to match.  they are very comfortable and can be worn casual or dress them up with jewelry. loved the feel and fit...packaging was perfect. very nice pant and hoodie, beautiful color, true size, but it`s not cotton, it`s 100% polyester. but i like it these pants are junior sizes. they are not very thick, but of good quality. the fabric does not change after wash. the fit is great. the price is unbeatable and the pants are sooooo comfortable amazing pants. ideal for hot summer weather. gives a chic casual look with casual tees and cotton tops. loved the print. would recommend it to my friends. :) [[videoid:943353e3ea34e50e167228c9edbdaa1a]] this video will show what they look like!! absolutely love these pants. i like them amazingly soft, not too warm, it has pockets!!!!!! and the designs are cute too.  if i could wear these 24/7 i would. :)  i originally bought size large (i\\'m a med to a large) and they were a bit too baggy and large, but i didn\\'t care, i still loved them.  i did, however, buy mediums for my second and third pair and will get mediums for my future pairs (told you i loved em!).  now, if only i could get these in a nice red plaid or buffalo check! verycomfortable. fits pretty well. material is of good quality. it was a good buy for me. i love my jumpsuit very very sexy very good fit, i would recommend this to a friend i love these scrubs more like cargo pants except not as thick. super comfy, i wear them to groom in or lounge around the house...i bought tall and they are perfect i\\'m 5\\'9&#34;. shorter than i like but very comfortable. they came right on time🙌 and they fit perfect the material is thinner than i expected but they are very comfortable and should be great for wearing to the gym or after the ice & snow leaves the area. love them! perfect fit and the material is nice and soft! thank you! they fit good soft comfortable cool (in every way). depending on where you &#34;waist&#34; it, affects the length. i am 5\\'3&#34; 160 lbs.  got the xl, fold the high waist, and length is perfect with flats. thinking of getting more - 1 for every day. love the pants very light weight weight and comfortable! true to size! excited to wear for vacations! as described. fit perfect they run large so be aware when you pick a size. but they are comfortable and can be worn for home or almost anything the material is a little thinner than expected, but for the money paid it is well worth it!! these are so comfortable, it\\'s like wearing pajamas! love these pants, and i get lots of compliments on them too! my friend is happy with this pant. very fast shipped. cause they were a a little small . the stretch needs to be more stretchy. it\\'s way too tight to be a medium love these! not just a cotton, which i love, nice smooth cotton/ elastic/ spandex that doesn\\'t stretch out a+++++++ i would buy this brand again. love them. thank you delightful merchandise;never disappointing.  you cannot go wrong with alfred dunner pants.  they are just what you\\'ve been looking for in terms of quality, beauty, perfect fit.  just be sure you order your own correct size, and you will be as delighted as i am. using them for belly dance and love them. will be buying more in different colors very nice fit i was hesitant about ordering since so many of the review suggested that these pants ran small. since i wear pants sized from 10-16 depending on cut and style, i ordered the medium and they fit just fine. i am petite (just under 5\\'), weigh around 180 and do not need extra room in thigh, but really need the elastic waist. these pants were cut right for me in that they are not too roomy in places where i don\\'t need roominess,  but i haven\\'t washed them yet. i\\'d order more if they came in sage green, black, charcoal or shades of purple. update: after washing, nothing changed (no significant shrinkage) and i\\'m wearing them today. i especially like the fact that there is no extra fabric flapping about as the fit is just snug enough to flatter without being confining. really, they are not too tight....not too small in the rear or too poochy in the front. capri length falls to about 7&#34; below mid-knee. i\\'d love to buy more colors but most of the \\'other\\' colors offered that i want are not available in my size. update: since i loved the wine color so much and the fit was great....i ordered the grey, black and cobalt blue ones and all three were cut smaller than the wine. they were much tighter in the rear, although the rest of the pant fit fine. i\\'ve ordered what i could in large to see if that fit works better. sigh.... they fit a little small but they still wear nice, and feel good!!  they go really nice with my boots i recently purchased! this is probably my 2nd or 3rd time writing a review on amazon.  i have been searching for a nice pair of beach pants for a number of years.  i was going to get a very expensive pair on nordstrom.com (the brand is becca i think) but decided to try amazon instead.  i received these pants 5 minutes ago and tried them on and i love them.  i am 5\\'2, 120 lbs and they fit me perfectly.  before i received the pants, i thought that i would need to shorten the legs a little bit and i don\\'t even need to do that.  we are going to florida soon and i will be wearing these a lot.  i have several scars on my legs that cause me to be very nervous when wearing shorts or a bathing suit.  but now that i have these, i think i look ok.  i have quite a few stretch marks (had a baby in 2012) on my lower abdomen so i can wear these pants with a bikini set and still feel comfortable.  i may order another pair as a backup :) gave to my mom for her birthday, she laughs every time she wears them love them perfect i have a hard time finding good pj pants.  the fact that i can also use these to work out in, is great.  they\\'re comfortable and look a million times cuter than i thought they would. really surprised by and happy with the purchase.  the fabric breathes and doesn\\'t cause me to overheat. nice but low waisted i recommend this item to every person who bike rides...its comfy and best part of it is its designed with a  seat pad form in which the bike seat does no longer feel discomforting as you bike. my only regret was not buying enough...so yes id place more orders on this item... i love these pants!! this is my second pair and i plan on ordering more. since i am almost 5\\'11 i am thrilled that they leave the hem unfinished so you can cut them if necessary (not necessary in my case). no seamstress is required if they are too long either. they are the most comfortable pants ever! i wish i had dozens of pairs because they are all i would wear every day of the week :) after reading reviews i bought up a size.  love them and so comfy.  dressed them up with heels and wore for date night! wonderful, long pants for lounging around, working out, or going for a stroll! fits wonderfully around the hips and thighs for a &#34;skinny-hips&#34; girl, and flares into a gorgeous boot cut.<br /><br />we\\'ll have to warn the petite girls: these pants are long. as in.. my 5\\'9 girl in 2-inch ankle boots had to hem them up by an inch to not step on them. i\\'m very familiar with pants like these, and knew what to expect.<br /><br />if you are new to lounge/yoga pants: these pants fit well, but run on the long side.<br /><br />all in all: an amazing deal, for some long and lightweight pants with a high yoga waist. great value! i bought these for my girlfriend and she loves them. she says they are very comfortable i love these leggings! they are so stylish and comfy. i\\'ve been getting compliments anytime i wear them. i was thinking of getting another pair in a different color. you can\\'t go wrong with these and the price is right! came way earlier than expected. looks exactly like the picture and true to size. i am 5\\'5 114.9 pounds and the small fit perfectly. love the color of these. have wore them a few times and have received lots of compliments. i wore them once with a tank dress and black combat boots, and once with a long slashed-up white shirt with a hot pink bandeau under. can think of lots more ways i want to wear them too! i rated this item &#34;muscle print 1a&#34; 4 stars because the product is nicely made, arrive incredibly quickly from china to the usa (ordered 11/25 and arrived 12/7) and were at a great price for the product. i\\'m a fairly curvy girl, usually in a pants size 10, and these stretched perfectly and flatteringly to my figure. super comfortable and durable feeling and the graphics are true to the photo.the only reason this product isn\\'t 5 star is because of the strong, plastic-y odor they have when they arrived. the odor lingered in the room and was left on my legs after i tried them on. i quickly put them in the washing machine however, so i\\'m hoping that solved my issue, i would be shocked if washing would not. the smell would only be a problem if you needed to wear them immediately after they arrived, and honestly will not keep me from ordering leggings like these again. highly recommended! these fit great. no need to use a belt either. they stay up perfectly and are so slim fitting you can wear a close knit top without a problem. these pants looked a littel funny in the picture and i was skeptical but i loved the print. so i went for it and i am so glad i did. they fit me very well. i am actually able to dress them up. the material is a great quality. these are a such great deal.  i luv them, they are perfect for the outfit that i planned... and i love the fabric - not too thick nor to thin. very comfy. wore before and during pregnancy... lasted almost a year before ripping (the inside thigh seam) so its safe to say they are durable. im 5\\'5&#34; with a long torso so most pants are too long for me but these were perfect i bought these for my very stylish daughter for christmas. she loved them, and she kept commenting that the material feels so good! the legs are long and we plan to buy more of the different patterns. my fashionable daughter-in-law fell in love with the pants, too, and can\\'t wait to get a pair. love them i bought these in size large, regular length.  i\\'m 5\\'8&#34; and 150#.  the scrubs fit perfect!  i probably could have gone with a medium, but i like my work clothes a little roomy, since i\\'m bending, squatting, etc., all night.  as far as the material, my gosh, it\\'s unbelievable!  by far the most comfortable scrubs i own.  i got them in red, and they\\'re so classy looking.  my patients and co-workers complimented me on them.  hubby just told me tonight again how &#34;sharp&#34; i looked the other night.  will order many more in the future!!! way better than i thought, really soft and stretchy ....meaning you can sleep in them because they are so comfortable. love it. nice fit, good product its not exactly like the picture, but for the price you cant beat it! im 5\\'4 130 pounds and the 8/10 fit perfectly. the shorts are not as high wasted as it seems, but its still wonderful. glad i purchased. all of the sun protective clothes seem expensive, but at least these pants are very comfortable and light. i like that they\\'re soft - some of the spf 50+ clothes feel very synthetic, almost like wearing plastic. these feel like cotton... the most comfortable i\\'ve found. just be honest about your true dress size. cuz you can run into problems with this outfit not looking right if you\\'re not. for me the stitching not great. fits and the color looks exactly like the picture of the model. except the top could be just a tad bit bagger. but the pattern is more like the reviewer\\'s  picture. all in all i\\'m really happy and i love this outfit. recommend the purchase luv them the. fit comfy. i ordered the \\'smoke\\' color in xl. i normally wear size 14 (pre-pregnancy) and these fit perfect. size l would\\'ve been too small for me. they look slightly different from the picture. the color is more of like a purple grey, but it\\'s a nice color so it didn\\'t bother me. the other thing is the material feels kind of like jeans, and i was expecting more of a \\'slacks\\' texture. but aside from that, they are so comfortable that i\\'m contemplating getting them in black too! i love these but they run small. love these pants. fit perfect. i am 5\\'9 and weigh 140. the large fit me perfectly. so far i have worn these about 4 times and they seem like pretty decent quality for only $10. i hang dry them to extend their life span and to preserve the color.  the down side is that you can see the front pocket lines. pants fit perfectly but the top is entirely too big, even though i ordered the xs. oh well, couldn\\'t beat the price for the top/bottom combo so it\\'s still worth it. these pants look stlish.  it culd be worn with sweaters for a warm and cosy winter day. they got perfect these were given as a gift and all i\\'ve heard is how warm and cozy they are. i love this comfy palazzo..looks & feels great on me.. i love these pants i usually wear a 12 - 14 size and these fit fine. love the side pockets for my cell phone. love the cute little touches the heart zipper charm. fabric is soft and sturdy. i\\'m 5\\'4&#34; and brought me a petite large fits great. i recently brought large cherokee scrubs they were too big sent them back. so beware of the fit. the most comfortable pants i have ever ever worn! had never tried yoga pants before due to the fact that im a  plus size woman. what a mistake. they hold you in while  being sooo comfortable. got these for my girlfriend, she\\'s 5\\'1 and they\\'re a little long on her but her butt looks great ;) got them for around the house anyway so worked out fine. i wish you could pick different sizes for the top and the bottom. pants fit perfect, the shirt was to big. hmmmm... a rash guard that only comes to the mid-calf.  these are really cute, but i feel so sorry for my unattended calves suffering mid-day sun under tropical skies.  aaaaah!  that\\'s what sun-screen is all about.  i love these capris and have decided to wear them on the plane to and from the big island.  they are so very comfortable.  with an appropriate rear-covering top, these really do make quite the fashion statement.  very nice.  i highly recommend. these are the most comfortable pants!!  knowing they are &#34;mens&#34; sweats i purchased the appropriate size and they are perfect!!  loose and comfy but not falling off either!  cant wait to get some more pairs!! so comfy!! can\\'t wait to wear them! the color and the material are awesome...trying to piece together my outfit now! these are extremely comfortable! i get many compliments when i wear these and the pattern and color is awesome. very comfortable to workout i had to put up a 1&#34; hem. i\\'m about 5\\'. very comfortable and finally a pair of pants that are plenty long! love these. fit well. very comfortable. these fit as expected....they\\'ll fit you too.  they fit most everybody.  thai fisherman pants...that\\'s what they are.  get a pair....or one unit with s place for two legs. came on time and fit better than expected but i am short and they dont have much give but they work for me. fits well but is not high-waisted. will still keep as it is very cute but be mindful when purchasing this. i am 5\\' 8&#34; and 120, just so you have a reference. i gave it 4 stars  only because i never received the top just the bottom and they are very comfortable so would have been a 5 for the entire set washes fine, comes out looking new. i held a star as i like a front crease in my slacks if i\\'m going to wear them for good. these do not have the sharp look of quality i would prefer, but they do not show a panty line and that was important to me. love these pants! ordered 2 more pair!! love! ♡♡ i\\'m a curvy size 12/14 and the large fits great.  the waistband stays up, and is comfortable.  i\\'m 5\\'8&#34;, but ordered the talls because koi always seem a little short to me.  when they arrived i thought they might be too tall, but after one wash, they shrunk up just enough.  i\\'ve washed them several times since and they\\'re holding up well and have not shrunk any more.  it hard for me to find scrubs that fit in the waist and the hip area, but these do great.  i plan on ordering a couple more pairs! ok these were exactly how i expected them to fit they are exact to the size chart. the fabric is high quality, i have bought palazzos before in this price range and usually they last only months because they are made out of cheap fabrics but this pair is out of slinky flowy fabric much like stretchy spandex/silky fabric.<br /><br />they are gorgeous, long lasting nice fabric and the high waist is awesome, i can totally put these with a ruffled vintage dress shirt and suspenders and its a totally cute high fashion outfit! i read the bad reviews so i can be super careful what i purchased and have to say i am pleasantly surprised how wrong they were but of course sometimes you purchased something others tell you to get and you just happened to get the one instance thats rare where you get poor customer service or a lemon or dysfunctional product so keep in mind how many rate this high and how others may have just been one of the rare few with happenstances, and give it a try but buy them thru amazon they ship faster and have fewer problems :) the capris are beautiful. the material is extremely soft and comfortable. although they fit ok, they\\'re a bit snug. i usually wear a size 14 so i ordered an x-l thinking they would surely fit but they barely do. i would suggest ordering a few sizes larger than the size chart suggest. the print of brown and blue is gorgeous! i\\'m 5\\'\\'3\\'\\'1/2 and i weigh 216 lbs (presently on a diet though xd) and i find these pairs of loungepants perfectly fitted for my height but it\\'s a bit tight around my waist and outer thighs (that\\'s what you get when you submit yourself to overeating) but overall it holds nicely even though i have to slightly twist and turn just to get it on me. thank goodness no tears. if i loose 10 lbs, it will slide on like a silk glove. the star printed cotton material is wonderful because it\\'s so breathable durable and soft and it goes great with either a red or black tshirt. i\\'d use cold and delicate washings carefully to avoid shrinkages and color fadings. for its bargain price, i\\'ve made a good choice in purchasing this item. a wonderful lounge pants ideal for bedtime or lounging confortably at home. this are spectacular. they are a little thin, but super comfortable. cotton fabric, washes and dries nicely. wore on the beach and loved them. very warm and comfy.  seems to be slightly big for size. i really like the style of these pants.  i had purchased an xs several years ago, but they were a little bit short.  i\\'m 5\\'6&#34;, 123lbs, size 0-2.  these pants fit fine in the waist (drawstring and elastic), but are quite large and actually a bit too long!  my legs are kind of big and muscular for my size, but i\\'m still swimming in these pants.  overall, i do like them a lot though, and they look just like the ones pictured. super comfy and cute!!!! pants are great looking, so much so that i am actually considering purchasing another pair.  however upon inspection when they arrived there was a little hole on the seam in the front.  i have to say i was a little p\\'d-off but because they are so cool looking i decided to sew up the hole instead of going through the trouble of returning it.  after i did a little more inspection i notice the seam along the mame-part looked as though it might come apart as well, so i sewed that seam up in hopes that a whole will not appear.  i\\'m in the process of washing them now and hope that they hold up.  so buy at your own well.  maybe i just got the bad pair. these pajama bottoms are really cute and fit very well.  the material is thin enough for wearing in the summer (but not cheaply thin).  the material is also quite soft. i m normal size 4-6, i order this one in size 8 after read all the reviews ,size 8 fits pretty good. feel s comfortable. nice buy! gr8 they fit easily, and they have nice pockets. good length, too. it\\'s so hard to find nice, inexpensive, synthetic and synthetic-blend petite pants for mature women these days. i\\'m thrilled with alfred dunner classics and have ordered more. it is the size i ordered, but i really needed a size smaller. it was not available. i will keep this because i can do so much with it. i read someone else\\'s review about the slits. they are there. two inches on both sides of the knees. looks very flattering. i love the material and you can not see thru it. however, if you get the pants in a tight fit, it stands to reason that it is going to be snug on you and whatever curves you may have will be pronounced. these are the best scrubs i\\'ve owned. i love that they have the petite and long options; i am vertically challenged and the petite fits me great. very comfortable got these for my teenage daughter.  they are nice and long, the flannel is soft, and the pattern is very cute.  they even have pockets, a touch which my daughter loved.  definitely recommend these. this is nice linen pants but runs small. so i\\'ve exchange to one size bigger and it fits good. i\\'m going to order other colors too. they are very nice. they are thick, so it\\'s good to wear them in the winter as well. i use mine for work. i am 4\\'11 so it\\'s hard to find work clothes that fit. they are a little long on me but they work. actually not to large but very long.  pant leg is just cut long so i\\'m not sure if i\\'m suppose to hem them myself or just cut them to a shorter length.  the rest of the fit is great and they are very comfortable. fits comfortably. doesn\\'t seem too cheap. i love the comfort of pull on pants that do not look old ladyish great pants for the gym. not see through, high-waisted and perfect length. truthful reviews here made this a success for my son. love i am 4\\'11 & 110 lbs and they fit great!! i did however had to cut at least the bottom detail off plus some(around 6 inches). they are also not as vibrant as the picture but still really colorful (i thought they would be darker like in the picture they are just a little lighter in person.) overall they are still really cute, and would recommend to any girl interested in buying these. the only reason i didn\\'t give them 5 stars was because i had to cut the whole bottom detail off but the fabric is awesome to not fray if you cut it. fit perfect close to perfect length for 30&#34; inseams. fit good:) love them! fit is great, love that the waist band can be folded over or left as is. ordered another pair after i tried these on! amazing fit! love them! the scrubs i ordered were just as pictured and for the price the quality was excellent! the scrubs are a little bit larger than my other xl scrubs. other than that, no complaints! love these, but had to send back due to being too tight. i wore a size 4 prior to this pregnancy, am 24 weeks along and have gained around 10 lbs so far and the size 4 were too snug. prefect fit as always great quality good sweatpant. washes well. wears well. very comfortable. doesn\\'t fade. looks good out in public. very happy with this purchase. i recently bought these and some other things for my wife on amazon. they are great, and my wife looks like scheherazade to me! :o) love these pants ! well its comfy but it fits small and i like the color i am 5\\'1/2 and weight 98 pounds and i ordered medium because i like my p.j\\'s to be a little baggy, i don\\'t like when it feels tight. soi had to return it. i will try large and see, but other then its comfy and soft :) okay well i like the p.j\\'s its fun and soft so i ordered large this time and its good i am keeping it:) got a full refund too. okay i ordered large and it fits i like it a bit loose:) great fit-would buy again my order arrived way earlier than expected and in very good condition.  the shorts are very cute and have a faded, vintage look.  they are exactly like in the picture.  i ordered a size small, and they are probably a size one or zero in american sizing.  very pleased with my purchase. i like them just fine. love them and they fit perfect good quality, service and fit great. bought the pants for my daughter. they are for christmas. i like them. i hope she does too. christmas is still a month away. too short excellent suit and quality.  fits as expected, arrived on time and looks like the picture.  love it. i love the way i look in them love the material super cute. extremely comfy. a little snug in the butt (i\\'m 5\\' 3&#34; 145lbs) however it\\'s still a comfortable fit. i love these! i like different style clothing and saw these ...had to have them....bought another style from them...not dissapointed at all....wish they had more . great deal. will buy again generally, these are fine, just way too long for my shorter legs.  i cut them, and the fit is fine with the shortened leg length.  comfortable. absolutely beautiful and sexy fit, great quality thank you!! these fit great except they do stretch as you wear them for working out, etc. i mostly love the fact that they are made mainly of cotton as they breathe well and are very comfortable!! great pants for the price fit nicely !! i bought this product for my daughter because she needed it for a dance performance.<br />it fit her perfectly and looked great on her.  i highly recommend it. very comfy, great every day pants, amazing for working out an fits to my long legs. very affordable as well. they fit great they are true to size as in the description and i love that they are opaque and not see thru even when stretched over my thighs or my calves, i can wear them with high heels or boots and they look amazing i am 165lbs 5ft 6 in tall and they fit great.<br />i already went back and ordered some more!<br />they take about 3 wks to arrive but they are worth it. absolutely love these. no itchy feeling like other linen pants. love them!! nice soft and comfy pair of pants a little long for a capri and wide in the hips but i still intend to wear it. very soft runs a little small good purchase. love these pants, good quality and very sliming i wear these, along with the slimhot capris, and use sweet sweat and just sweat away!  they do fit a little big, but are otherwise comfortable.  they do indeed increase the temp in my lower body, which feels like i\\'m getting more of an effective work-out.  they are a little noisy, as the material rubs when i\\'m walking, but nothing too loud or that the treadmill doesn\\'t drown out.  they\\'ve held up well through the wash, gentle cycle with just a touch of detergent and then air dry, in which they do dry rather quick. love these pants!  perfect fit great look and perfect for riding on our harley during cold weather!  :) going to order another pair! this pants fits somewhat large and my waist is around 29&#34; and hips around 41&#34;. nonetheless i still love this pants so much! the material is lovely and it feels so comfortable. i highly recommend this product. these pants are awesome, great quality, don\\'t feel cheap at all.the only thing is is that they are super long, im 5\\'5 and im going to have to alter them a tad bit.color is spot on too. i\\'ve bought these tights in ballet pink multiple times. they are breathable and wicking. i have a long torso and the tights are low-rise, but this hasn\\'t caused any discomfort. on occasion i have managed to work my toes out of the transition while dancing, but otherwise find these tights really comfortable. when older they get thin but i have never put a run in them. great for laying and workout at gym. great value. quality is okay, but i wouldn\\'t work in them great for a halloween costume! love them they are light weight but a little long i followed the reviews and orderd one size up at it was too big but its a beautiful pants i will get it altered. cute joggers. like the color, comfortable. nice pants got these as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves them and they\\'re incredibly good quality good deal....shipped quickly. product as described. they r sexy eventho too big for me.  i roll them up just a little see through nice and cozy! comfy, just fit smaller than expected. i love, smart shopping great pants. material is thin but all in all a nice pant i love these pants! the only thing i would say is that i wish they came in different sizes only because these pants fit just right. if i dry them they would probably shrink and then be too small and i love these pants so much that i wish i could\\'ve bought them in a bigger size so they will always fit me no matter what! but these pants + the price = heaven i\\'m a tough critic with tights. so they fit great and while the script is legible, it could be more crisp. excellent i looooove these pants! they\\'re great quality, cute, and super comfortable. the print is fun too 😄 palazzo pants are something i\\'d read about. but never thought i\\'d buy.  and then i signed on for a cruise next year.  at about the same time, these pants were advertised for sale.  i figured i could always return them if i didn\\'t like them.  never.  these are one of the best items in my wardrobe.  if you\\'ve never worn them, at least try them out.  they are great and (better yet) they make me look great, oo! the bottom fits great. the top however is huge! my boobs aren\\'t that big but i got absolutely no support from it. i ended up stitching the space together between the cups because there\\'s far too much material. i then stitched up the sides of the straps. now it fits great and i don\\'t have to worry about falling out. this is the best clothing item i\\'ve found in a long time.  sooo comfortable, perfect fit and way cute.  i bought a few pair and really wonder why i ever bothered with uncomfortable jeans all these years. perfect for the pool. i wear it in the water because i don\\'t luke to show my legs. it dries fast. these are exactly what i was hoping for.  they look great and are very warm. i totally love them! yay extremely soft and comfy. it was a fantastic buy and gift! i am 5\\'2 and 130lbs and a medium fits perfect. i did have to cut off about 3 inches to wear them with flats. the seams were strong, unlike some of the reviews i read! i will order more! i love these pants. very comfy and totally worth the price. i purchased these pants just minutes of splashing bleach on a pair my sister gave me.  i loved them and had to have another pair.  i just typed in the exact name from the tag of the ones i destroyed.  although the tags are exactly the same, i noted some differences in the pants i got from here.  first off, i\\'m 5\\'7\\\\\\\\\" and i love when i can find anything long enough for my long lanky legs.  the ones my sister gave me are very long, past my heel, and i liked that about the ones my sister gave me the most (it\\'s hard to find anything long enough for me). these are not as long and i have to adjust them just to make them not look like high waters on me!  and i got the same exact size.  also, the material is different.  the ones my sister gave me are very silky soft...these are a bit more rough.<br /><br />i would have given these pants five stars if it weren\\'t for those differences.  by the way, my sister says she got the ones she gave me from tj maxx years ago, so maybe they\\'ve changed things with these pants since then.  pity.  sure wish i could find the exact same ones again. i like it. i wear small size, and the s/m fits on me. besides, they are beautiful. i love these pants!  they go with everything and levis/jeans are too much in the way.  these are great with sandals or tennis shoes. i absolutely love these pants.  very comfy and cute!  fit perfect.  long enough which is important cause i have long legs.  fit perfectly and get a lot of compliments.  also got in delivered free in just 2 days.  was everything i was hoping. out of all the raggings order by far the best in quality and looks .... i am very happy with this pair of leggings. they fit correctly and are comfortable. great price and fast shipping i will order from this company again. i love these  pants! they are so comfortable i would have laike a little more room in the belly like in the legs but they fit my butt and make my legs look longer! they fit my hips well although they are a little long i look good  in them very nice.. very soft.. its smaller than i though though.. i ordered a size l, as i usually am, and it\\'s kind of tight, so i recommend to order a size larger... i just completely love them i\\'m 5\\'0 117lb i wear a size 3 in jeans so i ordered a size small and it fits great i\\'m big in the booty and it looks amazing material is not see threw i recommend 2 every1 my 13 year old daughter loved them.  perfect for her dance class i bought these for my daughter as they appeared very unique. they are great. the front of the legs has \\\\\\\\\"the tragedy of hamlet\\\\\\\\\" written in larger type and the rest of the legging is taken up with play lines, including the characters names. being a theatre buff she\\'s going to love them. really nice colors. runs slim in thighs, its to good. comfort my husband absolutely loves these pants.  even though the color selection was limited at christmas, he didn\\'t care.  he wears them around the house and says they are the most comfortable pants he has ever owned. my daughter had a pair and they looked so comfortable, and she received so many compliments...i had to get some for myself. the fit if great and i have not been disappointed. i hand wash or use the delicate cycle on the washer and air dry. the pants are cute with the pattern and overall fit as expected.  i got a large, but should have gone with a medium.  overall great - can pair with tons of colors and shoes. these fit well, feel great, look fantastic.  i\\'m very tall and they are actually &#34;long&#34;!  they can be dressed up with a nice blouse and heels or with a cute top and sandals.  can be used for work, special occasions or just get together.  with all the tight cute skinny fit pants out there, i totally recommend these if you want to go for elegance. i really like how they fie me. the fit is as expected and very long. i am 5\\'8&#34; and even with 2 inch heels the pants need a hem. the material is a flowing rayon that hugs at the hips. exactly as pictured. style wasn\\'t really what i wanted but i\\'m wearing them for work. the bottom of the pants do not fit around shoes. other than that they\\'re fine. nice but came too late for new years. allegra k product are from an asian company everything runs small so you have to go up a size if you are a m buy a large. i got these awhile back and figured i\\'d write a reply. they\\'re very comfy and soft, made of nice material but they aren\\'t very thick. after a few washes, they stretch so now when i wear them they don\\'t fit properly, they fall down.<br />i\\'d get it in a smaller size but i realize going to pink and buying a pair was the best option. love these!  they look like jeans but feel much softer and more comfy to wear.  they fit true to size and are very flattering. i really like these pants. they\\'re a nice cut. the paradise pink color is great and festive for the summer. the seam is a little off toward the bottom, but all in all will be looking to get more pants in different colors. bought for an ex girlfriend.<br /><br />:) really cute love them i have been wearing these almost daily since i got them. they are fairly warm, and have held up alright. the cut isn\\'t great but for the price you really can\\'t beat them. these pants are nice, but they are very tight. i am a size 6, and ordered a medium, but they fit more like a size 4. they feel very sturdy, and the length is good for wearing flats with, but not enough for heels (i am 5\\'8&#34;). the material is heavy, too hot for summer, but perfect for cooler temperatures. one thing to note is that these do not have pockets, which helps to make them look smoother, and good for either work or just going out.<br /><br />* i received a discount in exchange for an honest review. runs small i love these, but they are definitely a weird cut.  i am long-waisted and so it\\'s an awkward fit.  the length is just below the knee and they have a wonderful flowing look.  i am glad i went up a couple of sizes; otherwise, i think they\\'d be too tight.  love the look; especially flattering with a tunic top.  i would purchase another pair. adorable love these pants! they ran a bit smaller than i expected (i\\'m a 14/16, and the xl was a bit snug... but with this material, i\\'m sure they stretch with wear)... i\\'m going to be buying more!!! these are great leggings.  they fit as expected and are not see through at all! hatley clothing is a touch on the high-priced side but so worth it.  wearing hatley, it\\'s like a treat.  it\\'s soft, doesn\\'t shrink, fits properly & not baggy & dumpy looking, the prints don\\'t fade, & the construction of the garments are good.  just terrific overall.  i buy numerous pair because i love the designs& i know what i\\'m getting when i buy them. very slimming, and i can say it\\'s comfortable. its perfect for going out with a slim fitting top! it is a snug fit but my abdomen doesn\\'t feel squished (like wearing pantyhose) or too tight like denim to the point where i can\\'t breath. i\\'m very happy with what i thought was an &#34;iffy&#34; purchase! notice these do run a tad bit &#34;short&#34; on the legs. they are perfect for shrimpy people like myself, by they are for wearing heels to show them off. great solution for better coverage bottom half of my tankini. nice shorts best yoga pants i\\'ve purchased in over 10 years. should have bought my usual medium, but thought this would run small, it is true to size!  bought another pair these are my favorite pants, soft, comfy and wow, the &#34;talls&#34; are actually long enough for my long legs.  love them, highly recommend!! i purchased these in white, petite xl. normally, i can\\'t stand white pants, but my nursing school required them for our uniforms.  these scrubs are perfect in fit, size, durability, and fabric weight.  they clean up easily.  however, since they are white, neutral colored undergarments are required. they have not shrunk in the dryer at all and the cords at the bottom of the pant legs are the perfect solution in keeping your pants off of the floor. i recommend these in any color! sent me the right size im a size 2 and i needed a large cute, cute cute.  great pants great fit. a bit long, but easily taken of. love these pants these are very comfortable, but the material is somewhat thin. i had a tear on a seam after just a few wears. really comfortable and easy to care for just runs a little large and long. very comfortable.  just be aware the legs are really wide. i love these exercise pants! they are very stretchy and a nice cotton blend fabric. the little pocket with the velcro flap is perfect for my phone camera. wish i could wear them everyday! great fit and really comfortable.  i am 5\\'4 and they are a little long, but easy to fix love the pants , so comfortable.  awesome seller,  item arrived quickly these are just as pictured.  beautiful especially for the cost.  i typically wear a small, but these were a little snug; however, it is not a factor in them not looking great.  with the pleats, i just thought that they might run a little looser.  i love the length and the vintage look. i bought a pair of these (black & charcoal) and before i got them i took a chance and bought two more cause for the price how could you go wrong? and im happy i did they are amazing. the fit is perfect and they arnt see through at all!!! i seriously recommend these pants to anyone whole loves being comfy & still look great! these are cute but the waist dose go up past the belly button, the picture shows that they are low ridding. they are a little big in spots but nothing a long shirt or dress can\\'t fix. love these leggings!  the price is fabulous, and they look sooooooo cool!  the only possible down side is that the pleather material used for the front part of the pants do not stretch as easily as the back.  so sitting with bent knees is a little uncomfortable, and when you stand up the knee part leaves a bit of a saggy bulge.  also, since that fabric doesn\\'t have as much give, i could see it maybe ripping if a size that\\'s way too small is ordered.  the fabric on the back is very stretchy and very comfortable.<br /><br />overall, i think these are a terrific buy because the style is cute, trendy, and comfortable, the shipping was fast, and the price is really reasonable. these pants are comfy and a nice light material, great for warmer weather and casual wear. they have regular pockets and cargo pockets. my only complaint is that there are a few stitching irregularities with a couple of loose threads that were on mine. i bought these for my ol\\' lady and she thanked me... i got my backpacker pants. a bargain at $9.99 versus the $39.99 that was on the tag.  i have yet to wear them in the rain, but i\\'m sure they will do just fine. sierra is a quality store and this is a quality product! loved them i bought the white stripes print and it\\'s true to size. it\\'s an xl to an xxl and i thought that it will be big enough even if they go by asian sizes. i swing between a large and an xl and these fit fine.<br /><br />cons:<br />they are see through if you wear brightly colored underwear or white colored underwear. just wear something to cover your butt<br />i\\'m 5\\'4 and these are way too long for me. they scrunch up a lot at my ankles and i can pull them all the way up under my boobs.<br />they\\'re not cotton, but i can live with that, just have to hand wash them.<br /><br />pros:<br />they\\'re definitely true to size and stretch<br />they are comfortable, lightweight and breathable<br />the pattern is just as described<br />great for dancing in (which is why i bought them) this a very good place buy, i am in a age fashion transition and found this place where i can be very stylish and comfortable.thanks great fit good fit and quality for the price. very happy. will buy more. wish they were available in dark grey and had a longer hem. i am 5\\'8\\'\\'. these are really comfortable pants that look nice even though i\\'m short.  because of the price, i don\\'t worry about wearing them out or getting them dirty, but the zipper is cheaply made and doesn\\'t zip smoothly so i anticipate the zipper breaking before i wear out the pants.  i only wish they came in more colors! awesome! my 12 year old daughter is very happy with the product it fits her perfect.  the item is well made, easy to wear, comfortable and stylish.<br />thanks! these pants are so cute.  they have the strectch fit that is in style.  they go perfect with those pointed toe boots that are in all the shoe stores now. professional while still being really cute and trendy.  the only thing that i did not like about them is that the seam goes all the way from the top of the pant to the bottom.  it is okay in the front but i dont like that in the back.  they are still a keeper. very nice fitting pant that look great on! these are prettier in person; seller was fast; fits soooo comfortably.  palazzo pants are a girls best fit! nicely made. good feel. wish pants would draw up instead of in at the bottom but i love them!! these are true to size and the patterns look better in person. it makes me feel like i\\'m in the 70\\'s! i love the bottons on the side of the leg and the shipping was on time also. i recommend this to all girls small to medium in size. receive as posted and my daughter love em thank you it looks great. the fabric is decent, and it\\'s not see through i initially ordered the pants for my mother and ordered a large...when they arrived they looked as though they were a small.  i ended up keeping the pants for myself.  other than running small the pants are super comfortable! i love these pants, but i\\'m almost too fat to wear them properly. they measure 50 inches across the waist and even then i only managed a tiny 4 inch fold before tying them up. the skinny, in-shape guy that shows you how to tie them on youtube, managed two, 6 inch folds on each  side! so yeah, i need to lose more weight.<br /><br />i just wanted to warn those chunky ppl out there, who buy these thinking they will be loose around their waist. the only way these would fit loosely on me, would be if i wore them without any folds like a pregnant woman might. hahaha. and i\\'m only 237lbs and 5\\'9. (i say only 237 because i\\'m aware a lot of chunky ppl in the us are not even considered to be in the fat category unless they weigh over 300, according to some).<br /><br />other than that tho, the pants are amazing. such roomy, wide legs and the length is just right for a guy my height. i did my yoga with these the other day and it felt great. the fabric breathes really well and after you wash them, they cease to be scratchy like they are when you just get them. i recommend washing any clothing you get before wearing it, but make sure to wash these with dark colors only, cause they bleed a lot of it in the first few washes. i love these pants.  they are interesting and comfortable.  one of my favorite pairs. very comfortable pants!  i though the waist was a bit larger than i expected.  going to be great for traveling as the won\\'t show any wrinkles. i read the reviews and ordered the largest size i could due to my &#34;grown woman&#34; figure. they fit perfect. i would have loved to have the next size up which there doesn\\'t seem to be - i ordered the 13 (which actually a jr. size but slightly a bit larger than the women\\'s 12) due to me wanting these to fit looser so i could have a more relaxed fit for hiking but nevertheless - the fit is perfect! guess i\\'ll just have to loose a couple of pounds :). very good super cute and comfy, but i got a medium, am a size 6 5&#34;8&#34;, was a little big and long they run a bit small and you can see through them. i can still use them around the house. overall a great price. while this large worked for the receiver , i think a lot of folks may think the size ran small. i ordered one size up just to be safe but it worked. fit good look good i bought two pairs of these in different colors for summer and am happy with them. they\\'re a great flowy material and very comfortable. i\\'m only 5\\'3&#34;, so the pants go to my ankle. i love these pants!! fit is great.. just cut to choose length. size is right on. happy! loved them i am 5 foot 3 and 240 pounds.  i bought a 3x. they fit beautifully and made me feel great.  i got amazing compliments! i have lost 34 pounds since dec. 14 and wanted something special to wear to a party. they are so soft!  they are not hemmed so it was easy to trim to my desired floor length.  i just hand stitched the side seam to secure. i will buy many more and have shared this link with my daughters and sisters who want  some as well.  :) this a better quality then i expected absolutely love it and honestly worth way more this is a beautiful outfit fit good nice and beautiful  for my mom best pant i\\'ve ever owned.fits like a glove wrinkle free,temperature controlled,great price they fit perfectly. so cute and comfortable. thank you! i will be ordering more! i love all the pockets. can\\'t work without them. :) i really like the color/fit of these palazzo pants. they are very comfortable! you can dress them up or down, and they are really good for traveling. very nice ovoloo!<br /><br />dawn<br />simply sassy\\'s style i absolutely love these pants. they are very comfortable to wear and fit perfectly. nice pants..she loves them and they look great on her. i love these pants! i have run in them in colder weather (39 degrees) and i was warm enough, but they\\'re also light and cool. they don\\'t bunch and feel great. i have had trouble in the past with my underwear line showing in the workout bottoms i wear. these do show a slight line, but aren\\'t too bad. i expect to purchase more pairs. colorful pants to wear out or casual.  i love the material and the length for a tall person i have these in several colors and love them.  i have gotten rid of all my pants and only wear these with long tops.  that is my favorite look and most comfortable.  i also bought the ruched legging and also love the look of them. best pants i\\'ve ever ordered online. stretch and no zippers! love these pants. i ordered 3 and going to order the rest of the colors! i ordered a large as the size chart suggested after reviewing my measurements, but they were too tight throughout the thigh.  i kept them in hopes that i will lose a few pounds, but also ordered an extra large which fits perfectly (i\\'m a size 12-14).  also worth mentioning is the length:  i search high and low for long pants with 35-37&#34; inseams as i am 5\\'8&#34; tall with most of my height in my legs.  these are long enough!!! i could even wear them with a bit of a heel. so happy. :) my kitty rissa loves these !! it is comfortable as what the other customer comment and easy to wear just pull on. easy to iron just a bit loose as i purposely order size 22 instead of 20 as i\\'m not sure how stretchable the pant can be. can put in the washing machine. ideal for office and casual. very comfortable. i was a little nervous that these shorts would fit tight on me because i\\'m a big girl but i went ahead and ordered a large and when i got it in the mail and tried it on it fit amazing and they are very stretchy which is good for me cause i have big thighs and a big butt, it\\'s so worth getting it feels comfortable and they look amazing around the butt area 😍 in love with them great pants, comfy, true to size and are great workout pants. fit as expected. more like yoga pants than work pants. i\\'m a size 14 & these fit me. my daughter is a size 10 & she wears these & they look great! made my halloween costume perfect and can be fun for another outfit which i was not expecting.  very fast shipping ❤️ these pants are great, i love the compression fit. and they are tight at the waist, which is great for my mommy muffin top. (they hit just below the navel) i do wish they came up even higher, but this is the highest i could find. they are more of a legging than a pant. the material is just barely thick enough to wear at the gym as a pant... use your best judgement. my favorite leggings!!! so soft and warm.  look good with a big shirt or jacket. i love this compression pants. i mainly use them under my workout clothes and the sizing is the same for any other spanx pant. love these! fit great and a soft, beautiful material. am always a little wary about ordering from overseas as often i have to pay vat abd custom\\'s duties. my order arrived within the time limits and the article was just what i expected. thanks wow. these things really do run small. i\\'m 5\\'7&#34;, 130 and wear size 4-6 usually.  i didn\\'t believe other reviews about how small they are. at first, i ordered m+/l. way too small. but they looked pretty warm, so i returned and got l/xl. much better. i don\\'t know about wearing jeans underneath, but i can certainly wear leggings.  overall they\\'re great. i ordered grey because they were available with prime and free returns, and they came the next day.  just make sure to order a couple sizes bigger than you normally would. they fit wonderful i get so many compliments when i wear them. love the material but way to big. still need to send back for smaller size. sexy yet comfortable. fits like a glove. please with the product, it was a gift.  worth the couple little dollars. love them but the material does stretch so, i was a tad skeptical about these because the price seemed too good to be true and they were listed as one size.  i decided to give them a try since they were so inexpensive it didn\\'t seem like much of a risk.  i got the galaxy print and also the lightning one.<br /><br />i love them!  they are really unlike anything i\\'ve seen in stores around here.  everyone is asking me where i got them!!  they got here in about a week (much faster than the shipping estimate).  i am definitely going to buy a few more of these.  i really prefer to wear cotton (these are a polyester/nylon blend), but i love the print and they are actually really comfy for a synthetic fabric.  i have to say that i am pretty slender (5\\'9\\\\\\\\\", 125 lbs).  i am not sure how they would work on someone who is more survey, but they are great for me! this is my second pair and they are great, i paid at least $30 more for my first pair at a local shop. love, love, love them!!!! generously sized and they look cute on. now i just have to figure out what to wear with then! they slip a little, but they are good quality and they fit great. i feel like beetlejuice when i wear them ahahaha. definitely would say if you are thinking about it, get these! a little long but that was expected but great fit! because i have a calcium deformity on my left leg i love wide leg pants. these are very light weight and perfect for summer wear. i read the reviews about the thinness and was not phased by that, for if you are looking for a perfect palazzo for hotter climates this is the one. this jumpsuit fits so well but was a little shorter than expected.the folds over the bust area do not stay in place unless you pin it, so there may be a peak of cleavage. i got so many compliments! all day women were coming up to me asking me where i got this jumpsuit! i highly recommend it and will purchase it in the other colors as well! this is very comfy...just a bit long but totally worth the purchase! love them.  i got the orange and they are much cuter than i even expected.  super pleased with this purchase.  i also received them very quickly. they fit very well, comfortable, actually felt like you were wearing nothing, they were very long though, even with 2 1/2 inch heels they were still dragging the floor at work. i received a lot of compliments and people wanting to know where i got them. very happy with my purchase. plan to get them in black as well. so comfortable! i\\'ve been wearing them as maternity pants. i only take them off if i need to leave the house wearing &#34;real&#34; pants. i was so afraid to order these pants after looking at the other reviews of this item but i still took the chance! and boy am i glad. i am 5\\'11&#34; and i wear a size 4 and i was so scared that they were going to be way too short but they are to the floor on me. i don\\'t know if lucked out but once you follow the sizing chart in the description you shouldn\\'t have any problems. this short was very small. wish they would have fit. beautiful colors, soft fabric, and fit at expected. the only criticism would be that the legs were really long. they would be perfect as is if you plan on wearing them with heels or wedges, but if you want to wear them with sandals they will definitely need to be hemmed up a bit. well, i haven\\'t tried it on, but my wife linda has and she loves it. perfect fit and perfect length and she looks great in it. these are super soft and feel great on. i had to cut off about 6&#34; of the length, but i am use to doing this. i ordered these pants in white even though i have never dared to wear white in my entire adult life.  my husband said they look fine and he is totally critical when it comes to my clothes!  now i can wear white ~ hurray!  they are the perfect length for me (i\\'m 5\\'7\\\\\\\\\") and fit nicely around my waist in the 2x size.  not at all baggy like i feared they might be.  just all around nice pants. love the fit. i\\'m usually a size 6. went with xl and fits well. pleasantly surprised by quality. and they are so comfortable! i ordered size small in the coral. i love them!  i\\'m currently 6 months pregnant so will be ordering a medium to fit me in my last trimester! i love these! this is my favorite pant for everything from dressy to casual!!!! i tink they are fun love koi scrubs they always fit beautiful styles,colors these are really cute. really great choice! very cute pattern and comfy! just don\\'t like the one sz fits all part! but overall they are super cute! i saw these and just had to have them. the fit is so extremely comfortable i could sleep in them. and cute...oh my gosh are they bright, vivid, and so mod! ok, i\\'m showing my age. i love these and plan to buy more. i absolutely love these pants!! they look good with heels like in the picture or rolled up a few times and with sneakers. you can play them up or down, either way looks good. by the way i\\'m about 5\\'4&quot; and like 130lbs and medium fits perfect!! they fit great, they aren\\'t distorted at all or too tight or too loose, and they are just inches longer then my legs so they will fit for years to come, hopefully. i am 5\\' 1\\'\\'. i love the way they feel and were them all the time! they are so light weight and comfortable. no pinching in the waistband and the length is great for low heels or flats.  i love the seam down the front as they always look freshly pressed.  recommend these are great. they look great, and are really comfy but not all that stretchy. but over all these are very good (and warm) love koi! only brand of scrubs i will buy! love them and good price the pants fit great and are an awesome price! they are so comfy with the elastic waste band and look cute on. these ,looks pants are true to size, washed beautifully, light weight. thumbs up! bought in several colors.all colors are pretty okay very pleased with all of the colors i ordered im short and it is hard to find sweats pants in my leg length. these pants wash up well no srinking. yoga pants need room, so it\\'s all good bought these as a gift.  she loved them. since i have to wear a uniform at work & specific colors, these scrub pants are great. super comfortable & not hot. i love jockey brand scrubs. the only thing is i bought the scrub top & it is a slight color difference than the scrub pants, even though they both are suppose to be the same blues. the pants fit perfect. i am enjoying both pairs. great fit. quality fabric. fantastic price $6.99!  versatile!  i go to work in them, wash the floors and garden. wear them out for the evening! fit great, material is nice quality, length is good.  no odd sizing, or length like some other products.<br /><br />i\\'m so pleased with these, i ordered 2 other colors. these pants are a bit larger than i expected, but i can still wear them for yoga in my home.  very comfortable. i ordered a large and got a small.  have them ready to send back just snowed in for now.  i really liked them and would really like to be a small......ha ha  but that isn\\'t the case.  nice pants tho. 5\\'4 130lbs it fits me perfect so cute great went back for more colors. it actually looked and fit better than i thought.  very pleased!  looks a lot more expensive than the cost!<br />comfortable and yet stylish enough to dress up this product is smack on with color and i don\\'t know why i didn\\'t see the side pockets in the pants, but i love those (on both legs)!  the pants and top are both a little larger than expected but i assume will shrink just a bit with washing so i will bet on perfection. i will be purchasing this brand again in the future! they take a bit to air dry but these are awesome.  took them on a cruise, wore them with a uv shirt and a coolibar hat, and the only part of me that was even slightly red was the tops of my feet (because i forgot to resunscreen.)  i was five-foot-four and 250 at the time, carrying most of my weight in my butt and thighs. these fit wonderfully. cute and sizes are pretty good very comfortable and the fit is perfect! i should have gotten a medium.  but they are very comfy and i love them! got these for my daughters to wear and my 10 year old and my 13 year old love them.  material is soft, they are very stylish as well. love these pants length is perfect! color is fab, and so comfortable fits great and looks great. the elastic waist band is a bit uncomfortable, but definitely tolerable. my daughter loved this pants. she wanted to take them to school the very next day we received them, but she wears a uniform. i was a little skeptic about how it would look on her, being she is a little curvy, and i thought the colors would be to faded. but i have to say she looks really nice in them. comfortable fit & quality print. the white parts are slightly see through, but with nude/black/white underwear, it\\'s not an issue. these are super cute and comfortable! i\\'ve gotten multiple comments on them from both men and women. i have another pair similar to these but these one fit better for my narrow lil booty. these fit alittle small,other than that they are a great pair of pants! these pants are true to fit by size and very comfortable. nice and roomy and i\\'m 5\\' 8 1/2&#34; and 140 lbs. they fit nice wish they wouldn\\'t slide down when i work out v.v i love these pants so much. i used them to run in a 5k in july,they had lot of water being sprayed so i got to test them in water. and they feel great, great to run in. i have also worn them to the pool and they are very hot when you are not in the water, but once you get in they are great.<br /><br />the only small thing i found about them is that i would get a few air bubbles in the legs, but i would think that would happen with any swim pants. my boyfriend and i were being sonny and cher for halloween (i was going as sonny). i came across these pants and figured they would do the job. they are a light yellow so you want to be careful what you are wearing underneath. they were also a little long for me but i\\'m only 5\\'2&#34; so i\\'m sure they would be fine for an average sized person. i have addison\\'s disease, and the medication that keeps me alive- steroids- causes fat deposits in very specific places. round moon face, big beer gut belly, and i\\'m waiting on the best of all - a pad of fat on my upper back - buffalo hump.  i\\'ve never  been a supermodel, but i was going nuts bc my pants and most of my clothes still fit me, but the big round belly makes my pants slide down and down.... belts were not really helping. plus have lots of nausea/abdominal pain.  then i found these!  i have two pairs of the woman within yoga pants and one pair of the polka dotted leggings.  they are so comfortable and  they don\\'t slide down & off my gut!! i ordered @ 5 different kinds/brands of black yoga pants on amazon at the same time, and these are oh so far the best - i gave the others to my daughter who just had a baby & isn\\'t back into her old clothes yet. i have pretty thin legs, & the woman within pants i bought cling enough to flatter that and yet still cover my gut - i bet they would make great maternity clothing at a much lower cost than most &#34;official&#34; maternity clothes.  i\\'m happily shopping away for my next pairs of woman within pants.  my only regret is that they do not offer smaller sizes - i usually wear a size 10 pants and i\\'m only 5\\'3&#34;  so have to pass up on a lot of the items bc they will b too big.thank you!!! i have 4 kids & 4 grandchildren & my arms are usually full which was making it very tricky to pull my pants up- and of course they always fell down at awkward times and places :) very cute swim shorts. goes great with my bikini top. length of the legs was perfect for my height. waist sits in the right spot for me. i would buy them again. hides the muffin top that many of us fuller figure women have.  no tummy support in these swim shorts though that would make a sweet addition to these bottoms.  the fabric is light weight and the flower design is very cute.  i really like them. good. love them a lot :) fit great and very comfortable. got a size med im 5\\'3 and theyre perfect! theyre kinda thin so im thinking they may wear easily in the thighs though but still worth it i will probably purchase more pairs i love the lyss&eacute; fabrics and designs.  they are my go-to clothes; i always feel so polished when i wear them. these pants are very comfortable and it\\'s very easy to exercise in them- they don\\'t limit my movement. good quality elastic fabrique, nice flattering fit, classic pattern matches with everything. looks sexy. order your regular size. i am a size 13-14  and these fit nice, they are super soft inside and thick , to<br />wear with a sweater vest and some knee high boots, good value , good quality. the only thing they<br />are not black they are a reddish brown color. i bought this product to match a shirt i already had. it matches perfect. they fit just as i thought they would. i would recommend this product to anyone who wants to comfortable. fit great. thanks while i like the look of these pants, they are a bit too snug. i ordered using the size chart provided for this brand, but they seem about one size too small. i can still wear them, but since they are all cotton, i hope they don\\'t shrink. so far, i have washed them in cold water and line dry them to prevent shrinkage. i prefer my chef pants a little looser, so if you\\'re the same, you should order at least one size up. oddly, they also run very long. i ordered a small women\\'s, and the inseam is a couple of inches longer than the medium mens chef pants i ordered for my husband. one other observation: these pants ride lower than other brands, a little below the waist (at least on me). i have purchased other brands in the same size that fit fine, so i think it\\'s just this brand. next time i will go with another brand because of the size issues. what a soft, yet thick fabric!  not stiff at all.  i would wear these everyday, not just at the hospital!  really nice looking, comfortable, and pockets galore for all my goodies. very comfy! cant live without them love these. fit is great! you have to order a few size bigger than your average size, good product! my mom liked these pants! nice color and nice fit! very comfy! i would recommend these ii anyone! thanks! i received my pants today and am well satisfied.  i thought it was going to take until may to get them; but, they came today.<br />so far, i have been pleased with all items ordered. will buy again! i agree with kh\\'s review on 3/15/15.  having just received a pair of mediums (and owning a pair of medium american apparel disco pants) i would say the fit is nearly identical, or at least as close as two pants can be that are made from different fabrics.  the aa\\'s are a nice tight fit on me as are these.  the aa fabric is not as shiny and smooth as these.  these have more of a stretch satin type feel and look.  both brands have a similar stretch and the waist on these measured 13.5&#34; as do my aa\\'s.  these have a 28&#34; inseam the aa\\'s 27&#34;, but the aa\\'s have more stretch length wise so they both hit about the same spot above the ankle.  the aa fabric is definitely of higher quality and heavier weight.  the zipper on these is obviously not as good as the aa\\'s.  also these are shinier than the aa\\'s.  it all depends on your shine preference.  both pairs seem to have about the same max stretch measurements.  if you don\\'t mind the shinier finish these are a good, lower price alternative.  i have a feeling these won\\'t last as long due to the cheaper zipper and thinner fabric but on the other hand they offer the chance to have a number of different colors without  breaking the bank!  as far as others saying they are sized too small, disco pants are supposed to go on tight.  they will stretch in time to fit your body.<br /><br /> update:  4/14/15 just bought a second pair of mediums in the light purple color.  these are a little different than the wine red.  the fabric feels the same and they have about the same amount of stretch the long way, but the purple pair has at least 50% more stretch in width, so obviously the fabric composition is a little different even though the shine and feel are the same.  the purple ones also have a slimmer cut on the legs but with the added stretch the max size is the same.  if you have a larger waist the light purple will be more comfortable because although they both start out with a 27&#34; waist the purple has more stretch.  the only significant difference is in the added stretch giving more waist room, but there\\'s no way to know which colors behave which way.  one other note, both pair have the same &#34;american apparel&#34; knock off tags and the purple ones have an extra tag that has half of the fabric content (50% polyester).nificant difference is in the added stretch giving more waist room, but there\\'s no way to know which colors behave which way.  one other note, both pair have the same &#34;american apparel&#34; knock off tags and the purple ones have an extra tag that has half of the fabric content (50% polyester). i like them. they are a little large in the waist but not a problem. they were a little small in the crotch area, other than that, i loved them. fits as expected. satisfied. fast shipping. love the pockets! it\\'s really useful to carry things.<br />very good quality scrubs. i\\'d def recommend to others. according to the size chart i should have ordered a small.  i ordered a medium to be on the safe side.  i\\'m glad i did.  these pants are super stretchy but there is no way i would have been able to get a small on.  they are &#34;skinny&#34; style.  so i recommend ordering up a size.  with that said, i love these jeggings!  they are made from 95%cotton 5% spandex and they look fabulous on!  they really hug and hold everything making my legs look sleek and sexy.  the material is thick but not heavy.  no worries at all about being see through like some leggings.  very well made too.  these are going to last and look great for a long time and through many wears.  i got the black color and it is a deep black with a bit of sheen from the spandex.  the pants are so easy to dress up and are so comfortable to casually hang out in.  i\\'m going to have to get these in some of the other colors.  i was able to purchase this item at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion in a review. i love these pants. only thing that took some time was putting the laces in the pants. they are gorgeous!<br /><br />first time ever ordering clothing on line, but after reading all the reviews thought i\\'d chance it.  hard to find super wide leg palazzo\\'s and i have been looking for brown for ages.<br /><br />they just arrived in the mail today - took about 10 days from ordering (live in canada).<br />opened the package and was a little scared because the material is quite thin.  i have very cellulitey legs and so lumps and bumps show up easily.<br /><br />i have also put on some weight...i\\'ve gone up from a size 12 last year, to a 14 this year.  i am 5\\'7&#34;.  so...i was worried that they would fit weird - stretch pants are always a bit of a gamble...especially if you are chubby.<br /><br />i pulled them on, looked in the mirror and was like wow!<br /><br />they are exactly what i had hoped for exactly!  super comfortable...omgoodness!  so light and airy...it\\'s about 80 degrees here right now, and they are going to be perfect!  the waistband is a bit high, but i just rolled it down...the crotch sits where it should, and they are nice and long as they should be...just drifting on the floor a bit...very breezy / flowy...gorgeous!!<br /><br />i am so so happy with this purchase...wish they had them in creamy white!<br /><br />may purchase the camel coloured ones...i got the brown...<br /><br />gorgeous!!!!  wahoooo<br /><br />i look fabulous in them!  :)! the bottom of pants is way too long. i\\'m only 5&#34;3. but it fit my waist just right. thanks. i also love the color. i\\'ll have to take it to the place where they can fix the bottom and make it shorter for me. thanks. they are pants these were for my daughter whom is a size 3. the fit with the exception of in the waist. a tiny bit tight. but they are stretchy jeans so it was still very comfortable for her. bought this item and didn\\'t know what to expect because of low price. in the end i am absolutely happy - fits as i expected, color is way better than expected (bright and awesome). gonna buy more in different colors. i love these jeans, but holy crap they are tiny! they still fit, with every ounce of struggle inside of me.  i generally wear a 2/3, even have 0 in some pants, so i ordered a 3 & they fit! but very tight! i love the low rise, a lot of other pants i have got on amazon say low rise, but they come up right below my belly button & i don\\'t really like that.  these are true low rise jeans & the animal print ones i got even have glitter, so i am very happy with my purchase! i will most likely order another pair... this time i\\'m ordering a 5 though!!!<br />i weigh 110 & i\\'m 5\\'5, if that helps anyone figure out what size they are going to purchase!!! definitely recommend these pants. great color. a little tighter than i thought they would be when i got a medium (i\\'m a size 8/9), but still look nice! bought for my daughter and she loved them. bought this in the size large as a gift for my very fit size 6/8 daughter. she loves it. but both top and bottom are comfortably tight on her slim body. order two sizes larger than you think you need!! i love these hatley pajama bottoms,  they are so soft and comfortable,i could wear them all day. they are a little to spends though. great pants. it is very comfortable and nice. just what i needed for my outdoor work and have sun protection the quality is wonderful.  unfortunately, due to all of the reviews saying how small they run, i ordered 2 sizes \\\\\\\\\"up,\\\\\\\\\" and they were huge on me (i wear an 8 -- ordered a 12), so i\\'ll be exchanging these for a size 10.  im already excited to get them back!  good lookin cargos! i sew wedding dresses for a living, and i was very impressed with these pants. they are a high quality for the price. i just wish i had bought my usual size m...i bought the size l because reviews said they run small. not true. they have more stretch than i thought they would, and are flattering to us ladies with low hips. i love them! i am 5\\'9&#34; with a medium curvy build, fairly solid, but have trouble finding pants because of my hourglass figure and long legs. i bought the medium, which can sometimes be a toss-up owing to a wider hip, where the next size up is too big and falls off. these, however, fit perfectly in length, without dragging the floor (i have a 34&#34; inseam, and have an aversion to having my insteps show under my pants), so i can wear a comfortable heel for work. the fabric did not cling to me or constrict my waist, leaving for a nice, clean line all the way through. i love everything about these pants.  quality is outstanding.  was a little worried about the sizing read other reviews and decided to go up a size.  definitely going to get another pair. aside from adjusting the length, the fit was perfect!  love this trousers.  thank you. i ordered medium and they fit very well, a little long, but i\\'m short. here\\'s the thing with these leggings and you can see it in the stock pictures: the right leg is the right way. the knee cap is in the right spot and the pelvic bones are all right and they look great in the back too... and then you look at the left leg, it\\'s actually the wrong way. it has the back in the front and front in the back. so when someone designed these, they designed one leg and just sewed 2 of one leg together, making them uneven and with one side incorrect. that being said, i love these quirky leggings! they are a stretchy spandex material, and i was reminded of a halloween costume when i first got them, but when i tried them i was so pleased with the comfort. they fit so well and so far they are a very eye catching pair of leggings. i like how versatile they are. long i\\'m 5 4 way too long.  a bit difficult to hem but i will try very cute! great great color and great fit! these lounge pants are more comfortable than i thought they would be. i wear them around the house often. i think the pockets are a good length, too. highly recommend. feels great. so comfortable. my only gripe is that they don\\'t come in solid colors! love my white leggings fit perfectly for my halloween costume and the liquid wet black faux leggings were a fantabulous hit with my husband he loves them on me!!!! thank you ♥ these pants are awesome! i couldn\\'t find the small size so i figured i brought the xs. they are a little tight but i can lose a few pounds. suit was nice and well made. however i didnt like the color contrast on my body, so i returned it. i would still recommend this suit to anyone who likes the vintage styles. well made, fit is good. the fabric is not as high quality as i had expected. they are satisfactory for my needs. not as much purple as the picture indicates but very nice and fits well. fit great good little small and not perfect quality but style is good it is way too big. i usually wear i bought 3x i wear a 24 size pant, but ww must run big.  1x fits 24 size.  the pants are great when you find the right size. great perfect fit love these! the fold over makes them fit very nicely and the extra length is ideal being that i am 5\\'8. love them! comfy and great price love them!! i really love the look  light and airy beautiful and very sexy, but will not be able to fit it in my chest area so dis appointed. love these pants.  fit great and they are nice and airy for hot summer days. they\\'re a bit longer than in the photo, but that\\'s ok with me.  i like the high waistband, so there is more double coverage with a tankini top. when i saw these i laughed... they looked like they would be perfect for my 9 year old :) i still attempted to squeeze into them and miraculously i did and i felt comfortable!  but... given the amount of stretch the material thinned and these, i\\'m sorry to say, can only be worn at home because they became semi see through... bending over for a stretch would reveal way too much to my kickboxing buddies :))) i\\'m 5&#34;4, 140&#34; and got an s... maybe an m would not reveal as much :) had to wait a while to my own fault. please pay attention to the updated sizes. this is the best fitting jumpsuit ever. can be worn casual or dressed up, sandals or heels. the band can be tied in the back or front to give a slimmer waistline. the material is thick not easily seen through. one more addition to my allegra k collection. their clothes are really well made and reasonably priced. this is my favorite brand of uniform i have found yet.  i have bought several more since this purchase.  they are soft, comfortable, wrinkle-free, and the pants don\\'t fall down at all during my long shifts.  i am so happy i found these. this was a gift for my mom and she loves them. the pant legs are even and they fit as expected. this is a great product for comfortable days. i love this product. its a great product at a great price. its comfortable, easy to wash,  and fits great. they\\'re amazing and i love them! there is a handy zip-up pocket on the right thigh:) super convenient. the colors are different than the picture, i got green ones, but i love them all the same! i wonder if i were to order a second pair of i would get something different? that would be awesome. these are the best long underwear i have ever had. i am so pleased with them. i have worn them almost every day this winter. so warm and cozy, but not bulky at all. not problem these pants fit very well and the material is very soft and comfortable to my skin. love it but its not an american large...come on people....men like a little thickness..28 to 32 inch waist,,, that could be a large very nice - well made - love the fabric.  glad i read the reviews as this does run small.  i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; and 119 lbs and would normally take a small or extra small especially a jumpsuit but i took a chance an ordered a medium and it fits perfect.  if you don\\'t like pleats around the front waste then this isn\\'t for you. for me it is very nive and extremely flattering.  definately a keeper. i was pleasantly surprised. honestly, i was not expecting much because of the price. pretty good quality and i love the vibrant colors. they are extremely comfortable and i will be taking them with me on my trip through thailand and cambodia this summer to travel in. they fit great!!!! easy to wash and wear love them, just a tad larger. bought these for my gf and she seems to like them so no complaints. there spandex we will see how they hold up after a few washes. i was very pleased with the product.  and would order again when needed.  shipping was outstanding. they were the right size. they look great!  the material is a little rough, but hopefully after a few washes, it will be softer. i just love these. nice,long and cozy for my 5\\'9 frame. first of all they are shiny i ordered the xl and i probably  could have ordered the l  i am 5ft. 11in. with a 33in waist 34in long and i weigh 175lbs. the xl is a little loose around the waist and loose around my ankles everywhere else is nice and form fitting the only thing i did not like was how high they come up like two inches higher than my belly button and no camel toe! the pants are made of thick spandex, i would say you need to wear a thong because of panty line is visible unless you don\\'t care about vpl. high quality, fits great. great color, great style, great comfort. i knew white yoga pants would be see-through so not really a big deal. these are very comfy and i bought them for a halloween costume. they were warm enough standing by a fire, but obviously the cuffs stained with dirt quickly. i don\\'t really recommend white yoga pants in general, but these were comfortable and worked great for my costume, where i decided that pants were preferable to tights i love. these capris!  very comfortable. and light! i absolutely love this pants. i order the xl because i normally wear a lrg but wanted to make sure these fit and they were a little tight  but i\\'m very short and curvy so if you 5.6 these should be perfect!!! i had mine hinted and after a little wearing time they fit awesome. perfect linen pant love these! makes my rear look fabulous love it! these are soooo comfortable and fit great!!  i would buy again. everywhere i go, people stop to ask me where i got my pants - they fit great &amp; are so stylish with a simple white shirt &amp; heels, for work - makes a great suit, when paired with the jacket. the leggings are true to size and good quality. i\\'ve washed them once and line dried them, and they\\'ve definitely held their shape and quality. i liked them so much i bought another pair in a different color. the shipping was fast and the quality of the packaging was very good. these are a must have to dress up or dress down. plus they make your butt look really good :) sent this as a gift from a wish list and haven\\'t heard how it was received.  looks very appealing and would the giftee very nicely. quick shipping! love this item! i\\'m a larger woman, and this jumpsuit fits great in all the right places. lots of compliments. it can be difficult to find bra support because of the low cut, but just try different options to see what works best for you. i\\'m not really tall and are kinda fat. and this arrived yesterday and i tried on its pretty tight and hot of course cause its still summer. i would wear this on the fall or winter. i think it would look super cute and stylish with a dress. and i\\'m happy with the price. this is the cheapest price after i checked out all other stores and i have been looking for a tight legging like this for a while for my dress during winter. i\\'m really happy with this product and i brought  two of them hopefully the other one is coming soon. :) ok touchably soft and fun in bright colors! i like them very much. they feel good, they wash good and theyfit well will recomend them to other members of my family feels like wearing handkerchiefs, so thin & lightweight. if you are not totally skinny it is unflattering but extremely comfy around the house in summer heat. i like this pant. i heard things run small so i bought a large. fit perfectly. excellent! i love these but they are way to long!!!! i found this brand at a tourist oriented store in sea island florida.  i had not been able to find a retailer in my area so was glad that these were available. i have to wear a uniform to school which includes khaki pants. i can never really find comfortable khakis until i came across these. i have bought about 4 pairs and i refuse to wear other khakis. great work out clothes. i really like this brand. the clothes are good quality.they are a great price. these really are great scrub pants that allow you to have freedom from tying a drawstring around your ever-growing belly which is ideal and comfortable.<br /><br />sizing: i typically wear a large in cherokee uniforms and was initially planning on ordering xl but based on the reviews i ordered large. the large was perfect in length, fit fine on my  belly, and from my knee below. they were fitted/tight in the rear and thigh area though. i\\'m not sure about other mamas out there but those areas on me are growing as well as my belly and i\\'m not really looking for the &#34;fitted&#34; look when i go to work these days. right now, comfort reigns supreme and having pants that are tight on my thigh and butt is not comfortable! in fact, that is exactly what i was looking to get away from by ordering maternity pants as my usual pants are now tight. anyway i ordered the xl as originally planned and am much more satisfied. all is comfortable, the length, thigh and rear are all perfect. the belly section is a bit bigger than i need right now at 26 weeks but is still comfortable and gives room to grow. i love the material . great looking scrubs for the professional look. great fit, true to size love these! definitely great for the tall girls!!! this has just what you were hoping, in that it does the drape, twist, and versatile simplicity. truth in advertising. comfortable fit!! just perfect good fit....nice pants. i usually wear a medium but ordered this in large and it\\'s perfect.  they run a little small.  this is the 2nd pair of this brand that i\\'ve ordered and i highly recommend. the most comfortable pair of pants you will ever purchase. i wanted to wear them to the gym and to sleep! this item was exactly as expected. the quality is nice and it is very comfortable. i have worn it a number of times and received many compliments. i love it! i love these pants. perfect for going out or lounging around the house. easy to wash/dry and fit like a dream. plus i love the mod look. this is my fifth such pair! love these!! they are very comfortable. you can wear them as casual or dressy! stretchy and comfortable,  work appropriate i am 5&#34;10 and 160 lbs i ordered large tall pants. they are so long i walk on them and i should have ordered a medium bc they are too baggy it has a wonderful shape.  it is very snug, but it\\'s suppose to be that way.  i wasn\\'t totally expecting that girdle feel, but i like it.  great high-waisted vintage look to wear under a long black knit lace skirt i have.  great under-garment piece to have. i bought these pants for work, but i ended up wearing them every where! they are a descent price when everyone is struggling, with money. they wash well, wear well, and hold up well.<br /><br />i\\'ve bought them in all the colors offered in my size. i wish there were more colors and maybe a slightly heavier weight for winter wear.<br /><br />all i can say is thank you! the clip on the side works for leashes. the extra pocket is a perfect fit for a roll of pick up (dog poop) bags. the other pockets hold treats and keys, in a secure spot. again thank you!! i spend roughly 16 hours a day full dressed between my two jobs. luckily i don’t have a mandatory uniform for either job and these jeans are suitable for both. they are so comfortable even after an extended long day of being on the move. i don’t get a rash or irritate from them, the waist band is the perfect size and has some room but not to much. these are forgiving pants if you have a womanly figure. i always have trouble finding pants or jeans that fit because i actually have hips! if you have trouble finding pants that fit well, these are for you. they go from corporate to casual. they will need hemming if you are under 5\\'4&amp;quot;. want to order a couple more pairs;will need to go down a size next time,they are comfy and wash up nice.... thanks they are so cute and i like how they fit they stretch so they are not tight i\\'m happy i got them super comfy, love them! this one piece jumpsuit is a stylish addition to any wardrobe. the fabric is well-made and comfortable for any kind of weather. the material is  light and comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. the top portion of the jumpsuit is like a tube top with comfortable elastic to sit firmly in place. there is a an elastic area around the waist to add some contour and curves. the leg area is flowy making this outfit easy to move around in. it is great for a night out or can be dressed up by adding a cardigan. i really like this jumpsuit and highly recommend it.<br /><br />i received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. bought these for my wife for xmas. she loves them. she\\'s a size 3, but one-size-fits-all still worked. the rise is on the long side so the waist is high (but i think that\\'s normal for leggings? - sorry, guy-logic). they\\'re very warm and extremely comfortable, and look great. very soft!! fit perfectly!! good material, i work in a salon and the hair slides right off of them!! they fit just like the picture  they are a tad too low cut but because i don\\'t have the cute body for it and im five three so just a smidge too long but they haven\\'t been washed yet i chose the teal so cute also not sure if they will shrink so im not taking any chances because they are form fitting but without shrink they fit like a gloves and show off my curves;-) will most likely buy more due to comfort with a bit of style doesn\\'t just look like sloppy sweat pants my daughter loved these perfect love them! i loved these pants more than any other pants but the one leg ankle came apart and one pant leg turned into a flare pant, i donated them and loved them so much that i\\'m buying them again!!!! nice perfect!..soooooo comfortable....will definitely get more of these the only con is that i find the fabric to be of poorer quality than i hoped. i wore the pants for a day and where my thighs touch the fabric was already getting little balls on it.. and i\\'m not morbidly obese or running a marathon in these... i work from home and take care of my three kids.<br />i don\\'t think these will last me long before they get holes. just what i was looking for.  people seriously think i am wearing leather pants!  up close you can tell ofcourse... but as i am walking toward people... ive had someone say they liked my leather pants every time i wear them lol... get these.  i want to order more to have backups! super comfy, can be work to work or out on the town. unfortunately, the higher cotton percentage leads the pants to fade rather quickly. :( thanks they look good and classy on as linen pants should.<br />they are easy to wash and iron, hold their shape. the material is so lovely and smooth, very good fit, go a size down. i am usually a large and got a medium. very cute and comfy. perfect for the party i went to. only bad thing is they are a bit see through. so choose undergarments carefully. these are very nice lounge pants, well made and comfortable.  the 100% percent cotton is a must for me.  a bit baggy for me in the rear/hips but i suppose that\\'s to be expected with a 2x size and much better to be over-sized rather than under.  the first pair i had lasted about three years of regular use. then some of the seems started coming apart, and a few small holes and ragged edges appeared.  finally, the seem/hole in the back was about four inches in length and so my spouse said it was time to put those in the rag pile and order another.  i certainly like them well enough to want to have at least one pair available.  i also use the 100% percent cotton waffle knit polo ralph lauren pajama pants and while they are not quite as comfortable they do seem to last longer. this is the best workout outfit! these are very big. i was hoping to be able to wear them with flip flops. but i folded the top fold down and they were still very long. but very stylish. i\\'m 5 foot four and i weigh about 125 pounds. i got the small which was very roomy and long on me. i bought these for my cup cake for this years fourth of july i cant wait to see her in them for the whole evening watching the fireworks, bought these for my wife. she looks outstanding in regular jeans and in these she looks delicious. :)<br /><br />she wears the small to medium and they fit fantastic.<br /><br />she loves the details like the rhinestone rivets. not too over the top but enough flash to compliment her looks. very comfortable, a bit big and too long, but work great for heels! these pants are asian sizes and the size chart is accurate in showing what a us size is, i measured myself and followed the chart and the pants fit well. i was not pleased with the style though, the pants were just so loud when walking. i give the company 5 stars because when i asked about returning (because they are just too loud for hiking alaska) the company immediately responded with 4 different options for returns/refunds/exchanges. thanks for being so helpful. i love my pj\\'s they are so soft and comfortable, i can stay in them all day and night, the sellar sent them right away. these fit perfectly. a more loose fit as expected.<br />i\\'m waiting for them to have the other colors available.<br />i will order more.  they are soft and comfortable. these pants are one of the best purchases i\\'ve made in the last several years as far as clothing goes.  they fit great, they wear great and they look great.  i\\'m petite so it was nice to finally find pants that didn\\'t have to be hemmed.  its also hard to find pants like this with pockets.  very pleased with these! i love these! but i am not sure what to do with the extra fabric in the summer. it is a little too hot so i will be wearing these more as the cooler weather comes. my daughter got these pants and they are cute. the style, color, fit, & price is 5 stars. the material is not the best quality but it works. overall these pants are nice. very adorable. thanks tights are great and fit fine but are not a true black. they are a lighter black which is fine but i needed a true black for my cosplay outfit. so harley quinn fans beware. i bought a pair of the (misses) lee comfort straight leg pants in white - in preparation for vacation. i\\'ve never reviewed pants before, but wanted to review these because they are the most comfortable, soft, well fitting pants i\\'ve ever purchased! the fit is perfect - from the waist through the hips, and although the tag says they\\'re straight leg pants, the leg does have just a bit of a flair. often when i purchase pants, the average/medium length runs a bit long for me, but on the lee comfort pant even the length was perfect! i\\'m really happy with everything about these pants - they were a good value, with a price of right around $28 on sale.<br />when i picked the pants up, i noticed the soft fabric and the dressier appearance right away. the appearance is actually very versatile - could be worn as dressier pants, or dressed up jeans.<br />i haven\\'t noticed any bunching of the fabric, near the waist, as pants and jeans often do. they don\\'t wrinkle much at all - they hold their crisp appearance throughout the day. the waist is comfortable - there\\'s no gap in the back, and they\\'re very comfortable when you sit down as well.<br />the lee comfort pants wash well, and hold their size/shape. i\\'m a size 12 or sometimes 14 depending on brand - the lee pants in a size 12 fit perfectly. washing didn\\'t shrink them in size or in length.<br />i\\'m going to get the lee straight leg comfort pants in black as well because, both white and black, when paired with a jacket, will be perfect for work. the white will look great for any occasion in the summertime - from parties and concerts, to evenings out with my husband. i love them in white - they\\'re very slimming, and can\\'t wait to get a pair of black as well! [[asin:b004njk9i2 lee women comfort straight leg pants - white]] fit was small these are my favorite leggings i\\'ve ever bought, i love them. i will def be buying more of this brand the pants are great but the sizes run so small that i wound up making them a gift to someone else. i am just disappointed they could not be mine! the pants are darker than what the picture shows online. i\\'m a size 6-8 in womens so i chose size 10. they were loose around the waste. i returned mine cause they felt baggy. maybe i should of got one size smaller but all the reviews said to go two sizes up. don\\'t get the size you are cause then they may be too small. comfy...cool and wash beautifully. super soft material. runs true to size. not too short in the length. i usually love stanzino pants. they always deliver when it comes to style and material. highly recommend this. the pants are very nice, the fabric is smooth, not itchy whatsoever, and the pattern is very clear and nicely applied. a little small, on the legs, but besides that i\\'m pretty satisfied. they are great and fit good. 125 pounds 5\\'5&#34; fits wonderful. love these pants ok these pants fit perfect and are very comfortable.  im 5.1 and 117 lbs and medium is what i ordered if that helps. i think they are pretty good quality. i read a reviewer thought they were too thin but the pants i ordered were not at all. style and comfort! material is thinner than expected so around the house they are great too cold for the winter the pants are really nice...just did not fit me....tight in the waist and too big in the leg.....if you are smaller waisted, these might be perfect for you.... i love these palazzo pants. the fabric is wonderful, the fit is really nice, and there is a good variety of colors! i love love love these pants really wish they had more designs and colors kinda too long. guess i am too short. i bought a size medium- i am 5\\'4 and 130 lbs and they fit awesome because they stretch far. i think the large still would have fit fine though.<br />i wouldn\\'t wear this to a church picnic, however, they hug those curves and sometimes show some cheek. very sexy!<br />the color is exactly like picture.<br />all in all it is great quality and you\\'ll get what you pay for. 💓 ok for the price i bought these as a gift for my wife. she loves the look and feel. the extra fasteners on the top work well to provide the desired look.  highly recommend the product. great for the price! i took a star only because when i bend over you can see through the fabric a bit. i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; 195lbs and the xl was a bit to large but they feel fantastic!! nice i love these pants my husband bought these for me and they are well-made, fit perfectly and comfortable......love \\'em! love these blue pants i got. thanks ! some other item i wanted to buy but only available in black or dark brown which is kinda boring color for me. but i will keep looking for new item or new color. these fit me great, xl for a us 12.  i\\'m 5\\'9&#34; with a hourglass figure so i don\\'t have a problem with the waist rolling down as some have reviewed said.  i think these might roll down on others who have a shorter torso. comfortable and holds in extra flab well.  these do run very small so go up a size. so comfy they will fit as expected if you read the reviews. i saw these on pintrist have been totally obsessed with owning my own. i read the reviews and ordered a medium, (i am a little over five foot and 140lbs, women\\'s size 6). the pants fit perfect, besides the fact i will have to cut about 4 inches off the bottom, yeah i\\'m sad cause that\\'s allot of pretty design, but i like them anyways. i would buy more in different colors. size and color is true :) and i like it ✔ comfortable fit, nice fabric, that is not too thin or limp, but is more substantial.  i would recommend this product. im very pleased with these pants. the length was good and the quality is nice perfect. i would have preferred the suit jacket be the same light color as the photo. it is actually a much darker green. still, it is a very nice looking suit. love these capris, cute and unique. poorly made waist band, but for the price who cares. love love love.  polka dots are great cause you can match top to any tank or cami color.  only issue is i\\'m a bit short for them.  i\\'m 5\\'4. a few inches too long.  i rolled down waist one turn and its a bit better.  but be careful if your too short.  i would still buy again. i am only saying that it is somewhat large because it has 31&#34; long legs! no options for shorter legs are available. i had to cut and re-saw the buttom. i loved those pants, until a colleague commented that they looked like &#34;jammy pants.&#34; sigh! love it these pants are soooo comfortable, they are thick and stretchy and could be worn to yoga or around the house.  i highly recommend them and in fact am going to purchase more in different colors.  i purchased some by another seller and the quality was horrible in comparison.  amour pants sold by w&h store are the best quality for this style of pants…especially for the price!!!! took a chance, leaving next day on vacay, ordered fast delivery came as promised, they fit great, so happy...indigo color, ordered white but they weren\\'t able to make trip...order these you\\'ll love them.....jaz these are great! i am short only 5\\'1&#34; so the cropped version of these pants are excellent especially for the warmer summer months. great for teaching yoga classes on the days i don\\'t want to wear tight pants!! love these and will be ordering more. fits great purchased these as a birthday gift and recipient liked them.  comfortable and attractive. would purchase for myself or as a gift in the future. love these , nice soft, not to heavy ... bought these pants again because i love them and wear them everyday to work!! run a little small but my favorite pants i think i\\'ve ever had. don\\'t ever stop making them please!!!! i\\'m a manager of a local restaurant and bar and they are the perfect year round pants. thank you,rebecca s. veru comfortable. i received this item within a couple days of ordering it and was relieved that the item fit to a tee, and were just as cute as the picture online.  i tried them on, but i have not worn them.  this harem pant is great with a nice espadrille or flat sand. i like the fit and material.  however, i ordered a 16 t (i am 5\\'8&#34; tall) and the pants are too long.  in fact, i can take about 3 inches off the hem.  i could return them for a regular size, but i\\'m concerned that the colors i want won\\'t be available, so i will keep them and pay the price to have them hemmed professionally. great yoga pants to do yoga in studio. they\\'re high waisted and don\\'t show any belly when my shirt comes up a bit when doing yoga poses. she likes them.  very comfortable this company\\'s sizing is not consistent. order a larger size. otherwise they are very comfortable and i love the bright colors and pockets. thank you very much. great product all the women at work love your brand very much, all 12 of u are wearing koi\\'s now perfect fit, perfect length, exactly as written on the size chart. these pants are super hip looking, in a military green. the fabric is light, good for summer, yet still have a nice drape and roll up well without coming undone. they are very flattering on, streamlined at the hips but a lot of room in the thigh, perfect for my athletic build which i don\\'t like accentuated. i\\'m only 5\\'2&#34;, so can wear them unrolled for a baggy retro style or roll them up and wear with slouchy short boots for a trendier look. the price was great at 50% off with free shipping. i\\'ll be looking for more from this company on amazon. i\\'m very happy with my purchase. it was 3 inches larger i purchased these as a gift for my athletic 5\\'10&#34; daughter whose usual size is large not extra large, but i got the extra large hoping for extra length and to make allowance for any shrinkage.  the pants did shrink a little in washing but are still a bit on the large side.  unfortunately, the length also shrank a bit.  still the pants are fine (soft and good quality) for wearing around the house, which is what she wanted them for. i got these for working out and then are great for that. they fit snug and stay in place. soft and comfy! love them! run a tad small though! i\\'m 5 feet 100 pounds, and these fit really good, i could see taller people fitting into these because there very stretchy and form fitting, id think they\\'d look good on anyone! i like the pants a lot. i am in love with these pants. they drape beautifully, the elastic back is forgiving if you gain or lose a few pounds. very flattering. i was lucky enough to have ordered the very last pair at the slimskii site (size small) because the last pair here at amazon was snapped up before i could order it.<br /><br />i am writing this review even though they are out of stock at their site and here, to encourage slimskii to provide more of this style and to provide different colors too. just a fabulous pair of comfortable and fun pair of palazzo pants to wear at a great price. i would buy all the colors they would offer. nice looking and fits like a glove. i where them when i go out to have fun and i like how i can where any shirt,top or t-shirts..  try a par or tow and see what i mean. very soft i love these they are so freaking cute i love them. i can\\'t wait to wear them all the time yay 😬😬 also got here a week before the first expected date fits perfect! honestly i ordered these and then went to target and bought a pair twice as much. shockingly these lasted, target brand did not and ripped the inseams. they are very flattering to the figure. i bought 1 size smaller because that was the closest to my size. they fit perfectly!!! i wanted to purchase more but, they are not available. now, that\\'s disappointing. color is bright and as shown. also they fit perfectly. i normally wear a size 7 or 9 depending on brand and i ordered a large. i\\'m 8 months pregnant also and they are very stretchy amd comfortable. do not bother my baby bump at all! will order a variety of colors great material, good colors, comfortable cute and comfy item - a little smaller than what i expected, but guess i will just lose some weight! i really like this pants the print is very colorful and cute they fit nice and they warm and soft, the only problem i have is the material is not very strong so i\\'m afraid to rip them. i am 5\\' 7&#34; and 125 lbs. i usually wear a size 8 pants or a medium. the medium in these fit me perfectly. i wear them to work in an office setting that allows a slightly more casual look than some office workplaces. these are the most comfortable pants i\\'ve ever put on - more comfortable than pajamas! they are form fitting to my upper thigh then are loose to the floor. i was worried that the unfinished hem would look too casual but it doesn\\'t at all. the pants come with instructions on how to cut them shorter. i haven\\'t tried it but as long as you can cut a nice straight line, it seems like it would be easy. because they are so stretchy i can pull them up or down at little bit to accommodate different heel heights. the fold over waist band works well up or down. i\\'ve purchase these in several colors and have had no problem with see through even in the lighter colors. no show panties are a must though. the pants are heavy enough that i don\\'t feel over exposed and light enough that they are nice and cool.  i plan on wearing them all summer! i love these scrubs! i have purchased 7 pairs in different colors. they fit me perfectly and are extremely comfortable and functional for work. i have to order these because my local retailers do not carry xs-tall in stock. no biggy though because i can order my size/color  and with no shipping fee i\\'m getting them at the same price i would locally. i get so many compliments on these scrubs! most people are actually surprised that they are ,in fact, scrubs! anyway! i recommend these all the time! i like them they fit comfortably. i bought 3 colors in med.  i am really a large, but i figured they would stretch and they did.  the thing is that all three pair are at least 4 inches too long.  they drag on the floor!!!  i am 5\\'5&#34; and i don\\'t get all the people complaining that these are too short.  i like them enough that if they don\\'t shrink in the laundry, i\\'ll take them in for alterations.  long!!! way too long.  i don\\'t own any heels this long even if i would wear them, which i won\\'t.  ha. nice i\\'m a m-l top but m-s pants due to my height would of been nice to have the option of petite sizing so i\\'m not stepping on the bottoms of my pants. these are sexy & very cute on!...true to sz. i love the fit! so comfy and many compliments on how they make my booty look. i\\'m a size 4-6 and the small is perfect! sooooo comfortable!!!!!<br />i really like these! i ordered a medium and i\\'m 5\\'3\\' and a size 8-10 for pants. hope this helps.  i know i hate having to return something! ok i usually buy large in pj\\'s but from reading the reviews i bought medium.. and glad i did.  i\\'m 5\\'6 135 and usually things arent long enough for my liking, but these are even after drying them.  not to loose on the stomach and not too tight either.  no complaints from me. soft material and they fit perfect! nice fitting pants... i have 3 pairs of these and have bought these for my 4 daughters.  they breathe well and are the only pants i love. love them!!! way better then expected and love the material it compliments my figure .<br />will be buying different colors in the near future<br /><br />update :4/24 just got my 2nd pair in white (s) and fit perfect<br />will wear it on a good night out or everynight i go to bed cause they so soft exactly what i wanted. the first ones were so perfect, we had to get more! this is my daughters second pair. she is 21 with a great sense of style, and these were the perfect addition to her summer wardrobe. it was stretchable and very comfortable. exactly looks like the one in picture. i usually order m but have ordered s and it fits me well. true to its size and very comfortable since its strecth. my wife loves them, they have some streach in the material for better comfort but fit very well. the pattern is sharp and clear with great coloring. my only desire  would be they were sized for shorter people, my wife is only 5\\'2&#34;. sized for people closer to 5\\'6&#34;. fabric is lighter weight, not a fleece so in love with these bikini bottoms! i ordered them in two different colors. the fit is great, except for the top elastic is a little bit too tight. after stretching them over night they were fine. would totally recommend for that price! good buy the pants are made by keeping the latest trends in mind....they are so stylish that now i  wear these pants more than my stylish jeans. on one hand these palazzos are very comfortable and on the other hand they are very stylish also... so nowadays i prefer these pants only bought those as a yoga pants. they have certain authentic style and pretty comfortable for exercises. however there are certain asanas where i need to adjust them a bit nevertheless overall work fine for me.<br /><br />another drawback if you\\'re tall you may find that they are a bit short but this actually does not matter much for me. maybe one of the best purchases i\\'ve made! i\\'m of average build, curvy with a little cushion so i don\\'t normally wear anything this form fitting, but i absolutely love these! wish i had a pair for every day of the week! i highly recommend them to anyone looking for a comfy, flexible tight for any occasion. so comfortable and still looks professional. i definitely recommend these!!! package arrived in exactly 2 weeks - one month before estimated delivery!<br />item is very high quality; i have lots of different leggings but these stand out. they are not see-through, elastic, and shiny. when worn, they do not slide down the hips(most low quality leggings do). will buy more and recommend to others. i bought these for my teenage daughter (xs - she would normally wear us size 2 - 4) and they fit her really well.  my only complaint is that the zipper is slightly stiff and she struggles a bit, though once fastened they stay fastened..... awesome fit! i love how these are sexy but are still not overly revealing. i loved this one so much,<br />i bought another pair! nice lounge pants and sleepwear. they have two back pockets. i love this feature. the colors are nice, and the feel is nice. great for fall and winter. had to return cause i need small size which they didn\\'t have, however my mother like the pants great fit love them all good. tx 😁 i use these pants for work. they are comfortable and the pockets are useful. fits perfectly. i was a bit concerned about the size i ordered, but it was exact :) i really like them, the fabric is light and comfy, and price is very pleasing.  they met my expectations, for sure! these are made with great fabric. they are so soft. i love them, beautiful!! nice fabric and very confortable. perfect fit, terrific pants. nice and thick and soft and yet slim silhouette, nice looking. i love the deep pockets with the soft fuzz inside. i must admit to being surprised at the negative reviews. i take a small and these couldn\\'t fit better. i\\'m considering getting another pair. love these pants! so comfortable and the material is light! buying another pair! love them these shorts are awesome!!! so comfy. they are short bc they ride up but they are made long enough that your butt isn\\'t hanging out. i\\'ve been wearing them all day out and about. 😍 i plan on wearing these on a cruise, when we go to the beach to snorkel, etc. they are very attractive, and promise to protect me from sunburn i love those,they fit like a second skin,very elegant looking,they don\\'t look like yor typical leggings.i got them in small which is for x- small women like myself,so if you are smaller than small,these are for you. bought these in red and they took forever to get here, but they are worth the wait. fit great and are nice quality. i\\'m getting the blue ones, too! i ordered large and i weigh about 145 lbs. the fit is definitely small.  i kept what i ordered but, if i ordered another pair i would go one larger.  love the pants. these leggings fit perfect. love the material, i only use it to ride my motorcycle. ordered these for my picky mom who is very happy with it, fit true to size and feel good on her. i ordered the maroon, expecting a muted color. i basically got an off-red that stunned my eyes in light of my expectations! i\\'ve never before wanted my legs to glow, so i make these work by wearing pattern black tights over them. that softens the intensity of the color!<br /><br />if you are looking for an intense maroon, go for these! it\\'s not my personal style, but hey, they might be just what you\\'re looking for!<br /><br />the fabric is uber stretchy, and glossy, adding to the wow factor of the leggings. they are pretty warm under my jeans, so i wind up getting plenty of wear out of them =)<br /><br />would recommend, as long as bright legs are a plus to you. she loves them, perfect match with tank top we ordered and the dg angel shoes she got. i found these initially on a department store website but for considerably more, and in what i considered a random color (purple?) for courds. i found them in colors i liked on yet another website that offered free shipping, but again, for about $20 more a pair.<br /><br />based on advice in reviews on these various sites, i ordered a size down. my pants size can range from a 2 to an 8 depending on where i shop (designer versus department store versus boutique versus sporting goods), but i\\'m nearly always a size 4 at national brand name stores.  though i have yet to wash/dry, i\\'d consider the advice spot on: the 2 fits like a glove. in a good way! they\\'re very comfy -- and they stretch -- but flattering. i ordered the pants in both ganache and earth green, and oddly, the latter seems to be just the slightest bit roomier.<br /><br />the bootcut style on this is minimal but i suppose that\\'s why they\\'re called bootcut and not flare. as someone who is 5\\'6&#34;, the pants seem cut best for shoes with a heel but since i live on the edge, i think i\\'ll feel comfortable sporting flats as well; they will then of course be a bit bunchy at the bottom and maybe rub a bit on the ground, but they look ok.<br /><br />on both pairs, the courd is very thin. the ganache is a very dark brown, similar to what you see in the photos, while the earth green i\\'d describe less as green and more as a light brown. i think the amazon photos depict this color pretty accurately, though some of the online photos on other sites show a tinge of green that i can only imagine they were able to bring out with some very interesting lighting.<br /><br />will try to remember to update after a wash! they are a tad snug but that\\'s a given considering their purpose. i love them. thank you!!! i had been searching for years for bamboo yoga pants that weren\\'t $90-100 a pair. i have a brand i love but each pair costs me so much i had to find an alternative for my active summer job; i get to wear yoga pants everyday and $100 a pair was too steep.  i finally found these and thought for the price, i will give them a try. so far they have kept their color after washing, they are softer than cotton yoga pants and hold up better than any other cotton brand i have purchased on amazon or in stores for a similar price. as for fit, i am 5\\'7&#34; and usually buy size large pants, i bought the xl to insure i had extra length because i like them a little long.  it worked and they are a little long on me, they are tight around my butt but a there is a little extra material around my thighs but that\\'s okay.  i prefer tighter but i will trade it for the longer length.  the stitching wasn\\'t the best as one reviewer mentioned but they haven\\'t come undone or anything. i heard a rip when i did my first few yoga moves in them but it doesn\\'t seem to have compromised the pants yet.  if they start to unravel i will be sure to update this review.  i have purchased 3 pairs so far and really love them for the price. i would recommend these to anyone who loves bamboo yoga pants but doesn\\'t want to pay the normal $100 price tag. they aren\\'t as great as my favorite brand but well worth it for the savings.  i am surprised more people haven\\'t caught on to these yet. very nice pants. the material is durable and the cut is very flattering. they wash and wear nice with no ironing. i plan to order more of these. good i think i could live in gaucho pants. these are comfortable, fit perfectly and wash well. and they look super cute on! great pants, i got size s. run a little small but good length i am 5.4 and on average size 4 in pants for flats<br />got a pair of medium too long but sit better on hips, not too tight on your butt. fit and look great. this was a gift for my daughter who is a yoga instructor....she loves it.  fits well, very comfortable... comfortable and flattering enough. i would go a size down in the future because they were a little baggy. i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; 118 lbs and i got a size small. really nice! i love these sweatpants.  thanks to the reviewers who said they\\'re cut big, the large is perfect for me.  they\\'re a nice medium weight.  will definitely buy more in other colors. best fitting scrub pants. fits true to size.  i have several pair of the five pocket grey\\'s anatomy pant and they fit bigger than expected. i ordered these pants because i was looking for some wide-leg yoga pants. they are great! super soft and breathable material and they are very flattering. they are very thin as well, but are not see through. the only problem is that the size i was too big. they seemed very loose and i was worried they would not stay up, so i am returning and ordering a smaller pair. they are also low-cut when you have them rolled sown. if you do not like low cut pants they may not be for you. otherwise, buy them now! in as many colors as you can! the fit is a bit larger than expected, but they are comfortable and inexpensive. bought these to wear around the house.  they are perfect and very comfortable.  thanks so much.  they\\'re a good buy ! love them but runs tight. i know i am a girl with big legs and hips but a small waist and for me a womens size 6 usually fits but this seems to be jr sizes so i need a large! white leggings that are not at all see through.  nice!  you can get sweaty in these in yoga class without them looking like wet tee shirt material. i love anthropologie and these pants were definitely a steal from luggagebiz, i ordered one in each color.  they fit great and i am glad that i ordered them.  shipping was fast as well.  i hope more anthropologie items will be available this way! i am 5\\'5&#34; and order a small tall. i think i should have gone with the regular, as they are a little long. i gained a few pounds, but was a true small before. they fit a bit snug, but should be shedding the pounds by end of mouth. these are true to size. they fit nice in the bum area and give a nice shape. love they are comfortable and for the most part all i wanted.  my only complaint is though i have very long legs i actually have to shorten them.  if someone has short legs they will loose the style of them. like it to fit loose. i knew these cords would fit perfectly. why? because gloria vanderbilt never disappoints. well made comfortable waist band and they move and stretch as you do. totally satisfied. i have been buying her jeans for years and will continue to do so. great quality product at a decent price for us plus sized ladies. really comfortable and moveable. fabric is soft and flexible and lasts well. shipped before the arrival date &#34;perk&#34; , exactly what i expected. pro good fit, color, price<br /><br />con thin fabric my daughter has worn these over and over again. the material is very soft and stretchy. she is 5\\'8 and the length was perfect. fits great and comfy to move around in. prompt shipping and came in perfect condition. thanks so much! these pants are the best!!! no joke, i love them. they fit great and are incredibly flattering. i always get compliments when i rock any of the styles! the customer service is amazing. delivery is on time and i have always been happy. order them immediately! #leggings4u.com i love em but should have went a size smaller there 2 big in the thighs i where a 22 normally an should went with a 20 wife wanted camo and could not find a 20 in her size. i told her to check amazon she found these and ordered their size 20. she was excited when they arrived, she loved the look the smaller pockets on the calf area and the fabric, she immediately tried them on but was disappointed when she could not get them to button up. we are returning and she is in the process of looking for other camo on amazon. these were actually better looking than the website photo. i thought they might be substandard material because the price, but they are nice quality and i can\\'t wait to wear them with my ankle boots. these are comfortable, and i like the color. my only complaint is that i expected these to be slightly textured like &#34;jeggings,&#34; and they\\'re not. they\\'re sort of a thin sweatpant material. i feel weird wearing them unless i\\'ve got a shirt that\\'s long enough to cover my butt. just know when you\\'re buying them that they look more like leggings than pants. i was hesitant about buying leggings on line but these are perfect. they don\\'t cut into my waist like most leggings. i have been wearing bend over plus size petite slacks for 20 years. the best ones that wrinkle the least are in black and brown. they look like men\\'s tuxedo pants without the satin stripe so they are very dressy with an elegant top, or very sporty with just a pullover summer blouse. wash them in cold water and put in the dryer on low for only 10 minutes and then put them on a hanger so they never need ironing. i am a woman. james the scholar was my husband, now deceased. these came fast, and are what i ordered. i did not end up using them for the party i got them for, however i am saving them for my halloween costume stash! thank you~ there are items in our closets that we tend to wear all the time... these are a great example.  the wash well, wear well and fit perfectly... i have also introduced a few friends to them that also feel the same..  after this review another order will be placed if other colors are available. i\\'m a college prof in las vegas, where it\\'s still hot in november and summer classes are unbearable to even drive to because of the heat. these pants have beautiful colors and are alight, soft fabric that is a tactile delight. i ordered the blue first, wore them to class once and got so many compliments that i immediately bought them in two more colors. about 10 minutes in the dryer on low heat, and wrinkles disappear. i wear them with the chiffon tops, also purchased on amazon over a sleeveless turtleneck or tank with coordinating flats bought from guess where--amazon. great outfits on a budget for a desert prof. they would be a must-have for comfortable travel, too. these are very cute the picture is a little mess leading they are not as wide leg as the picture shows. my wife loves it. excelente the pants i received did not have the frilly edges, nor did it look like a jean pants.<br />but it fits reasonably well and and most importantly, it is comfortable for all day wear. probably will hold up better with a larger belly! good quality ah. i love these. they are comfortable. i wear m in most stretchy-pants and ordered an xl from this and they fit perfectly. super comfortable. love these pants.  great quality with a slightly heavier weight fabric. looks great, even dressed them up a bit and was able to wear them to work.  also great for just lounging.  fyi - out of the package had a terrible smell of dye, fixed after 1 was in cold and line dried. well made, attractive, and the pockets are great.  they are nice and stretchy, but not sloppy looking.  they are holding up well after a couple of washings, and not fading.  zero complaints. can\\'t say enough good things about these leggings! all the stores by my house were sold out of the fleece lined leggings so i took a chance and bought these. so glad that i took the chance! they 5\\'5&#34; and 142lbs and they fit perfectly. they keep your legs really warm on cold days. they do smell a little bit like chemicals when you open the package but after washing them, they are fine. i like them so much, i will be buying more so i am stocked up for next fall/winter :) well made, great printing, and very comfortable.  have had many compliments on them.  soo happy with this purchase.  thank you. pants were a little long, but love the look and feel. i\\'m loving these skinny pants! i am curvy around the hips but have really skinny legs from the knee down, and have the hardest time finding pants that fit right. normally to get something to fit my waist/hips (i\\'m usually size 12/14), the legs end up being really baggy and the overall fit isn\\'t flattering. leggings honestly have generally been the only things that will fit everywhere. these pants fit right below my belly button, and bunch a tiny bit at my ankle. i\\'m 5\\'5, so someone shorter than me would probably want to roll them, and someone taller wouldn\\'t need to to. i\\'m at the point where i can leave them a little bunched and it\\'s cute, or i could roll them once and have a &#34;neater&#34; look. these have great stretch to them through the butt and legs, but i wish there was a little more stretch at the waist. other than that, i wouldn\\'t change anything. these fit like leggings (snug from top to bottom) but have pockets (though only on the butt, no front pockets) that i can stick my phone or keys in. these are also comfy enough you could wear them around the house and not be thinking &#34;i need to change into my sweats!&#34;, which is a common thought of mine when i\\'m in jeans. :) note: item purchased at a discount to test and provide a review. these are wonderful jeans. own several pair and am never disappointed. they feel wonderful and wear really well. the amazon price was lower than some department store prices. washes well, comfy, soft, i bought these in white and they were a little see-through, so i dyed them a pale taupe, which i really liked and it solved the problem.  i understand why people complain about the wasteband, but i can live with it. i ordered these in charcoal and absolutely love them! i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; and normally wear 4-6 or a medium. but reviews say to size up so i ordered large. they fit good and are super comfortable. they are a little bit loose in the waist but fits great on my legs. if i had ordered medium, after looking at the size chart again, i\\'m almost certain they would have been a too tight. and i like to err on the comfortable side. :)<br />i\\'m also extremely happy with this seller. shipping was so fast! pretty awesome. not as loose fitting as i thought they\\'d be, but they\\'re awesome none the less. i recommend! these are great leggings -- very soft, stretchy, and warm. they look great with my sweater boots. these pants fit me as expected, but, i advise shoppers to know there size and order at least one size bigger. my body type is consistent with the models so i knew they would fit to size; average american girls need to order @ least one size up so it doesn\\'t run small they are so soft and comfortable, i  plan to wear these on a overseas plane trip. i am 5\\'3, 123lbs. they are about 1in too long so the hem touches the ground, but doesn\\'t necessarily drag. i am very, very happy with these! i recently had a baby and wanted some pants similar to leggings that look more like jeans! these are perfect! the color is great and hasnt faded even after a few washes. the material/thickness is exactly what i wanted where they are thick and have a look/texture like jeans but are still soft and stretch well.  in terms of sizing, i am 5\\'4&#34; and like i said i had a baby about 2 months ago so i\\'m at 130 right now with the baby weight but normally 120. i went off of the reviews and chose a us large/ asia extra large but it was too big, mainly the legs and the butt area. i got a us medium/asia large and they are perfect. since i\\'m shorter, the high waist reaches slightly past my belly button. the actual length is at my ankles which i like and i can wear with sandals or boots if i want. overall, i am so happy with these and will buy more! slightly on the bigger side i ordered a medium which is what i normally wear i thought it was a little on the bigger side but still looks cute over yr swimsuit,  you can\\'t go wrong with the price i am going to order the black ones :) seems well made. i love stretchy pants that go great with everything. these are perfect for any ocassion. you can dress them up or dress them down depending on your style... love them i bought these for my pregnant daughter- she loves them! the price was great! i had been looking for tan maternity pants for her work uniform and these were half as what other sites charge for similar pants. i was reading previous reviews about size and was surprised by the negative comments. i normally wear a size 3 (which is slightly baggy) and i ordered a 2. they fit perfectly! i haven\\'t washed them yet, but since they are cotton i will just wash in cold and line dry. i can\\'t wait to try hiking in these! great design and fit! great casual pants that feel and look good.  wear them mostly in the warmer weather! perfect cute i purchased the navy striped pair and love to wear them as casual pants, or sleepwear. the light blue are see through, sleepwear only, very soft and comfortable, very thin. love these if i could get away with wearing these every day, i would. i love everything neutral, the stripes just make these fun. they are easy to pair with different styles and colors of tops and different styles of shoes. i wear them as pajamas or a weekend bottom. really comfortable and fit as expected (i am a 10-ish, so they are on the snugger side, but fit fine in the waste and legs). it is small, but color is perfect i love them. only bad is they are a little long, great for taller people i\\'m 5\\'5 and i step on the ends. comfy ! exactly what i wanted :) this is what i wanted.<br />i\\'m overjoyed to finally have a material dri more, that i can walk in or activities that cause sweating and in a petite  length!! good pants fav stretchy and comfortable will order more had to cut because too long so lost some design on the bottom. but other than that good fit and comfy. by far the best lovely i have too many curves for these very straight legged pants.  perfect for a thin, non hip & buttock endowed person. this set was perfect at first. but after a couple of washes, the jacket had a much tighter fit. inexplicably, the pants didn\\'t shrink but you do have the waist band turning a bit. even with all that, this is a very comfortable set. i will have to stretch the jacket out but other than that, i like it. would i order another one? maybe in a larger size to accommodate for the jacket. love them! very comfy & fit as expected! this are the best jean capris ever!i bought my first pair about three years ago.they fit great and are so comfortable, when i went back to get more, they were gone. each year after, i was able to get at least two,including this year.i wear them all year, so i would like alot more. i need size 16, and they seem to run out first. why only sell them in the summer?and why don`t you stock a lot more? also, i have never seen them in the pebble color in my size.target: please get more! thanks, mac although the pants fit somewhat large i love them. the material feels great. very cool in hot weather. love the color love these. showed up right on time and they are super comfy. color is perfect, no complaints. highly recommend. i absolutely adore these pants. they are true to size. i ordered them in every color. they hug your body so if you are insecure about your stomach and butt, i wouldn\\'t buy. they are made to show off not made to cover up the goods. i love the pants so much, i\\'m wondering where can i find the black top with silver studs that the model has on? very comfortable and the fabric feels amazing. colors are just as vibrant as photo. bought them for a friend and whooooooooo if you saw her wearing them you\\'d be looking for more stars to rate these they r a nice fit i like them look gd wit heels r flats thanx i will b ordrering more soon these are really comfortable and look nice. the fabric is super soft and breathable. after wearing the pants all day they kept their shape and still fit perfectly. the waistband was not too tight, and the length was great for my 5\\'2&#34; body. if you are looking for cute, stylish, comfortable pants, then these are perfect! this are perfect working out and pajama pants.  they were a little big on me, but that was expected from the description. these don\\'t seem to stretch like i was hoping for a spandex product. excelente very elegant! pants are hard to fit.......cannot really criticize as they just didn\\'t work for me..... these are my first ever online clothing order...very pleased.  the fabric is imho a medium weight, exactly as i expected for flannel pajama pants.  a nice touch, i didn\\'t notice before ordering, is the drawstring tie is a polyester satin instead of a shoelace-type string.  i ordered a large because i like my loungewear to have a looser fit.  i usually wear medium size (hips 37 inches), and these are perfectly roomy for me.  came back to order another pair, but the blue is sold out!  will definitely check back for more.  shipping was quick, product as described, price excellent...what more do ya want?<br /><br />update july 2012:  checked back, these had come back in stock, so i ordered another pair.  still very pleased with these pants.  the quality was the same, shipping the same, price the same.  i would definitely buy these again.  these are perfect for a little \\\\\\\\\"anytime\\\\\\\\\" gift for a friend who likes cozy casual wear.<br /><br />update december 2012:  toasty!  it\\'s cold here now and these are very comfy and warm.  have washed and dried them many times and they haven\\'t shrunk or faded.  very pleased.<br /><br />update november 2014: still yummy!  they have faded from washing (cold/delicate), but the seams, hems, waistbands are still solid.  excellent value. these pants are the best thing for south florida. finally i have pants that i can wear that provide coverage and breathability in this hot and humid weather. and the pattern is absolutely terrific. these are honestly the most comfortable pants i have worn. i love them so much i ordered 5 more. my daughter ordred these and loves, loves, loves them. she has several different shirts to wear with it. made a girl happy. great fit and extremely comfortable. i am 5\\'3&#34; and a size 4-6. the medium fits great and the length was perfect. i didn\\'t have a problem with the pant being too long as other\\'s stated in their reviews. the waist isn\\'t constricted like most yoga pants. the pant doesn\\'t loosen in the thigh/knee after wearing all day. in addition, they have held up extremely well after several rounds in the washer and dryer.<br />i ordered the white and after receiving, i ordered several more in the white. it\\'s a great summer pant to wear with a casual sandal and cute yoga top or high low t-shirt. bought these for my wife based on the sizing recommendations and they fit her well. decent shipping speed and they weren\\'t damaged. not the highest quality product, but what you would expect for $10. if they last her a year then i got my monies worth. knew they would be a bit small (especially with my voluptuousnessity, i\\'m a size 16), but with the elastic waist they\\'re still incredibly comfortable and look great. frankly, it\\'s nice to fit in a one-size-fits! and they\\'re adorable. i love these pants. these fit great, look good on, and have that nice slimming effect you get with the high top.  i\\'d buy them again. the package was lost but i finally got it. the pants are great. this item looks so much better than pic!! soft too! my daughter loved them, as an avid giraffe lover! thx brilliant live these keg gongs although i will treat them more like leggings and cover my butt. i am 5\\'9&#34; 130 lbs and usually get a small in most pants but didn\\'t want too tight a fit and so got a m. glad i did although i bet a s would have fit. but i like a little &#34;give&#34; now at my age. i\\'m 58 and plan on wearing these with long rayon tops for work and sandles this summer at my office job. a casual easy look. they fit great and the fabric feels sturdy and i love the details on the sides. glad i got them. i bought the tan zipper model and if they had the same thing in navy i would get them too, but the navy don\\'t have the zippers. darn! i ordered a medium and the tag on the shorts says it\\'s a small. didn\\'t fit me but i gave then to a friend and she loved them. i got a size that should have been way big on me, but they fit comfortably.  they are well made and have quickly become some of my favorite pants. the color burgundy is brighter/red than i expected but still a very lovely color. the pants are cur long for my 5\\'4\\'\\' height, but they are cut at the bottom (not hemmed) so i will cut them about 2&#34; shorter. i hope they will be fine cut and not hemmed especially when laundered. very comfy, but just a little long, but i will order some more so comfortable and flowing. love no elastic pants. they are a bit long on me but i expect that for my height. sexy high  waist, gorgeous, stretchable<br />arrived more than a month<br />other than that it is highly recommended for the price you can\\'t beat it nice pants and material. great look. these pants make me feel good.  they are so soft and comfortable.  love the look and quality of this pant. very comfortable. love it love it but too small, i am a small size 7 bought large and does not fit just got these and i love them, they are very comfortable and lightweight but not cheap. fits very well and i like the colors. great buy. fits very well.  very comfortable. the price is good too.  ordered another one of different color.  will wear even after the baby\\'s birth. good for the price. really cute i think the price for these leggings is great as well as the color and fit. i\\'m also very happy that they\\'re aren\\'t see-through and i like the material. i haven\\'t had any trouble with the waist band; i ordered a medium and they fit as expected. super comfy! i\\'m 5\\'8 and usually wear size 26 on jeans (2 on pants) so i ordered a small. i wish they were a little bit tighte around my hips but either way:: these are the most comfortable pants in the world no joke and i will definitely order many more in different colors. accurate shipping time as well gorgeous leggings! and great material! fits great, soft material .. says hand wash just hope it doesn\\'t run these pj pants arrived, i was not thrilled, but didn\\'t matter they weren\\'t for me, i decided to get the m, because i wasn\\'t sure how they would wash, they were huge, but all turned out, they are pj so nothing fashionable about them, so they are a bit big, and actually didn\\'t shrink hardly and all, overall, what matters is that my daughter was happy with them.  thank you i\\'m not sure why all these leggings (most of which are made in asia) are so high-waisted.  a little irritating, but otherwise, the material was nice and soft, the colors were as shown, and the small fit me well even though i\\'m usually a 0 or xs in bottoms.  i\\'ll just roll over the top as i really don\\'t like anything coming to my navel! the quality, sizing and fit are excellent...a good wardrobe investment at a reasonable price... excellent quality! super fast shipping! highly recommend this product! i was really skeptical about these when they arrived because the material is a bit thin and didnt seem like it would stretch however i was pleasantly surprised that they fit pretty well (as someone whose a little curves - bought a size medium) and they did stretch a bit. i will advise that for those tall girls, they aren\\'t very long, i like the short/ kinda cropped/ cuffed look but on me (and i\\'m 5\\'9) they hit and inch or so above the ankle. if your looking for full length, these might only accommodate 5\\'7 and below. otherwise, i love these. i wear them cuffed with heels and a cute bag and it looks great! i love them great fit as i am 5\\'10&#34;  generous in length great price. i wore them for work, very comfortable, bonus: no wrinkles! i was looking for a pair of yoga  crop pants in white.  these yoga crop pants are awesome.  they are perfect fit and thickness - usually white yoga pants are very thin material and not very slimming and often see through.  these pants are so soft, so comfortable and thick enough to offer a slimming effect and also not being see through.  i love the style and the shape that i am definitely going be purchasing more in different colors i like this but they are very thin! fit just perfect and looks very nice on me. this product actually looks much nicer than the picture, in my opinion. i wore it out today and got so many compliments, it\\'s amazing. it is so comfortable. the fabric is very delicate and could have been kind of sheer, had it not been for the extra layer around the &#34;private area&#34;.<br />so, so beautiful. i absolutely love it. so happy with this purchase! yay! was as expected nice and stretchy, just what i was looking for! [[videoid:f8cda230b35ce843c98c3de0451cefb2]]these fashion yoga pants are absolutely superb!  i love the leg flare, and they are wide to hide my lipedema thighs! they move and groove with me as i walk, i wish i were taller haha, i would have to wear boots with them because i am only 4\\'10 so they drag the ground. the waist band can be rolled down and or up it is comfortable and non binding, and anything that camouflages my large legs is a win win for me. i love that they are made in the usa and made of stretchy material which can help keep me cool in the hot virginia summers, they can be dressed up or down and come in a wide array of colors. i was so excited to try these free in exchange for my review and happy that i did so they get a thumbs up from me and will be recommending them to my lipedema community. these pants are amazing. if you\\'re thinking about buying them, stop thinking and just do it! first off, the material feels great; soft and velvety, the style is also quite lovely, with its tapered legs and hip flattering side pockets. i am 5\\' 9 with a medium build and bought two different sizes, sm which fits snugly. it\\'s comfortable enough to wear but i wish it was a tad roomier, so if you also like a bit of room, then maybe a m or ml is a better choice. i also bought an os and love how it fits! another great feature is that these pants look great with any type of footwear; ballet flats, flat sandals, pumps, wedges or combat boots and they also go with all kinds of tops. finally, the colours are as shown; bright/vibrant/lovely. tons of compliments on these, definitely my new favourite. the jacket was smaller - but the pants fit great! holds its material over a year now! great pant. got the xl and i am normally a size 10 in pants. i have a large bottom and these are a definite sexy fit. i have the roses on black pants and i. love them. i matched a long sleeve tee to the red and i wear them outside.  they are super soft and comfortable. i\\'m going to buy the moi ones after christmas! so i am 5\\'7 , 100-103 lbs , ordered these in xs tall, i must say , they were big for me ! i like the color (navy) and the material, altough i did not expected them to be so big . i took them to the tailor and now they fit ok ..the xs felt more like and s . comfy cozy love these pants nice pair of pants. just what we were looking for. my order arrived today.. and i love them so much they are perfect thankyou so, i wear yoga pants daily. i originally discovered these at sams club - and i was thankful to find them on the amazon. they fit like a dream, are comfortable, and have great quality. can\\'t really go wrong with baggy dress pants with pockets. these are a nice go to on super hot days. flattering and interesting shape it gives you. i\\'d buy in different colors.<br />don\\'t see too many people running around with these on. i like the side flap like shapes that flow around the hips.<br />good design. i bought these and crapped in them immediately.  i can\\'t wait to do it again!!!  i was only able to s*** in my other pants, but i can take a full-on crap in these babies! great pant, but runs small. size up one from your usual size. otherwise, they look good, lay flat, wash well, and are very comfortable. i got one in each color for my 83 year old mother and she wears them every day. very cute pants but they fit very small. very low cut, very shallow in the crotch area, very slim in the hips. almost no stretch for a linen pant. i  5&#34;1 and these pants where almost a whole foot too long!<br />so if your tiny and tall, they\\'re perfect! material is of very good quality but it\\'s too small :( i bought these to wear once for fashion\\'s sake, and then after to yoga - they did just as expected:  wore great for a day, developed a run in the crotch and thereafter had to be worn with shorts over them. which is totally fine.  i love the material and the length/fit (i wear about a us 8 and these fit perfectly) - they\\'re the right weight/breathability for a heated yoga class.  also satanic kitties! yay! what amazingly soft and comfy pants!<br />i knew from reading through reviews that i would want to size up and i made the right choice! i normally would wear a xxl, but went ahead and got these in 3x and they are a nice comfy fit.<br />i also was worried about how i would look in flared pants, but love how fashionably chic these are.<br />the fabric is just super soft, stretchy, and allows you to move around or &#34;flow&#34; around more accurately.<br />i doubt there is anything more comfortable you could wear to do yoga, excercise, or anything else.<br />the material is quality with no loose threads. length is just to tops of the feet, can roll the waist down to below hips, or over hips, whichever you prefer!<br />love these so much!<br /><br />*provided for my opinion and review very comfortable and long enough, i\\'m 5ft9 and it\\'s hard finding pants long enough so that was a plus. i got a size med. i love the material. these pants are so comfortable. i had an issue wit the size on this pantsuit. it was to small. the pantsuit itself was beautiful. i contacted the seller and they were more than happy to fix the problem. i have bought from this seller before and will again. great service. it fit well i was a little uncertain when ordering, as i am a size 12, which sometimes translates to a large and other times an extra-large.  i ordered the extra-large and i\\'m quite pleased with the fit and quality.  very comfortable to sleep in and the fabric is a cute pattern of musical notes.  perfect for our hot central california summers. great price for real jeggings. most of everything labeled jeggings are mislabeled skinny jeans or printed leggings. these are real jeggings. they\\'re softer, thinner than denim, which is perfect for summer, and they fit perfectly. there are some loose strings on the inside, which can be easily (and carefully) trimmed, so that\\'s not even an issue. comfy and sleek. basically, if you want pretty good jeggings for less than $30, these are the way to go. good the fit is not snug on me but a perfect envelope and hopefully will still fit if i shed a few pounds. super comfortable. i like that there is only a slight hem so you can roll the bottom edge up and wear them capris.<br />good for all seasons. for good and the material is soft and stretchy, perfect! love them i\\'m 5\\'5 127 lb and i got a size medium fits perfect. i am almost 6\\'0&#34; and the legs on these pants were too short.  other than that they were very cute and warm and good for wearing inside my house. love them! good material nicely made and fit great. pregnant daughter loves them and wears them a lot. i have to say.... when i opened the package, i was sure i was going to have to hand these pants down to my teenage daughter -- i amy 5\\'6&#34; and bought a medium/large based on the reviews and they looked awful small/short. but when i tried them on, they fit perfectly. they were amazingly comfortable, and i was surprised that they came all the way down to my ankles. i know these are going to be my &#34;go-to&#34; comfy pants this fall/winter. i wear a size small /  5\\' 7 120 perfect fit and great length for 4 inch heels. not exactly dressy but smart casual. perfect fit very comfy! love winter white pants, but so hard to find....found them so quickly on amazon and received within a few days!  can\\'t beat the price either.... under $20!!  plus, they are lined! these pants are so comfortable. i have gotten so many compliments by both men and women, old and young when i wear\\'em. they are great!! matter of fact i have bought several pair. the size runs true to size.  the seller was promp getting them out. comfortable fits well, the small pocket is great for holding keys and cash. keeps warm during morning runs in the autumn. fit perfectly for my petite body. can\\'t wait for my cosplay! i  love this product but the fit was way too big and exchanged them for a smaller size, which worked out much better. comfy and the pattern is so in right now. bought these to replace 10yr old flannel pj bottoms and they are definitely meeting my standards. very comfortable and look great for work.  no pockets which i really love because of the no bulking in the hip area. bought black and blue. i hate shopping for clothes because it is so hard to find something that fits right and looks good on me but i gave in and ordered these pants because i really needed some nice black pants that were light weight. i am so glad that i did because these pants are exactly what i needed. they fit just right and are very light weight which is great for this hot summer weather. these pants are very versatile and look great casually with a t-shirt or even dressed up with a nice blouse and dressy sandals. these pants are so comfortable for lounging around the house and they would also be great buffet pants or hey even yoga pants since they are stretchy and have no painful buttons or zippers. i ordered these in black but i now need these in every color available, yes that is how comfortable and versatile these pants are. i received these wide leg pants at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. cute, funky and fun. got this to have something casual and comfortable but a little different. checks all the boxes. wish the straps were a little wider/sturdier feeling, but otherwise a fun wardrobe addition. so comfortable!!! ordering another pair!! my granddaughter loves these pants i bought for her! after reading other reviews, i wasn\\'t sure what to expect.  i am pleased with these pants.  the extra stretch gives them what they needed to fit my extra size while still losing weight.  i do need \\'spanx\\' to give the fit the correct look for my xl size.  the long length matches with the picture so they are right for me at 5\\' 6&#34; should i decide to wear heels.  if your shorter, you\\'ll need to hem them.  they are definitely a summer pant as they are light weight but that\\'s where beining familiar with materials comes in handy. i love it!!! i love them.great fit but length could be slightly longer. super comfy! i love that you can cut the length to fit.  i usually have a hard time finding pants that are not too long.  these are perfect!  i can cut and not have to hem the length! good quality! thank you i bought these and am satisfied overall with fit and material. very nice is little smal but like thank you my daughter loves them. it was a bit thinner than i expected, but very nice. love, love, love these yoga pants!!!great material, great fit and great buy! these are comparable to victoria secret\\'s yoga pants at half the price. i highly recommend these pants! very nice pants, textile feels very soft. shrinked a little bit after washing/drying (delicate mode). i\\'ve had several compliments on how different and nice this track suit looks on me.  i love it. fits snug but not to snug, love it! good these are good for the price. i bought a little larger than i am. i got the large based on reviews. im a 26 inch waist and 38 inch hips. it fit alright although the calves are a bit tight and the top could be tighter so it doesnt fall down as much. i like that it has pockets and are slimming style. fit as expected, but too thin for the winter.  however, a very good quality overall. ordered a size up just in case, and they are slightly loose on my daughter, but she loves them. am considering getting a second pair in their smallest size, as she is usually a zero. she loves the pockets and being able to carry her phone without a purse. she is so not a purse girl. i was a bit surprised that they were not lace all the way around the leg but they are still something i have been searching for. very cute and great floral pattern, i would recommend them to a friend, just wish i would have known about the spandex leather on the back. very good here is what you should know<br />(pants i got were the) black + white<br /><br />what i saw when upon opening your package<br /><br />these when i opened the package i immediately thought trash when i saw they looked all around but then i noticed the odd thing  below the waistband they have it extra tall so it fits like a &#34;high waisted&#34;and its got that &#34;extra crotch space&#34; as i call it where you have weird room there and a shiny stripe thats different material...<br /><br />when worn<br />super cold these things are super thin but perfect for jogging in but these leggings are so thin that i could wear these in a warm sunny day and probably still feel cold...there breathable and nice don\\'t squeeze much but their very shaped and almost skin tight (don\\'t worry their not unbreathable tight just a nice look though if you like being comfy and looking nice) so i decided to keep them their not trash after all....very nice for making you look &#34;shaped&#34; their pretty but not sexy don\\'t worry about underwear showing in the black/white pair however you can kinda see the underwear lines showing depending but they show through the sides<br /><br />pros<br />pretty fit<br />very nice looking<br />not to tight on the waist<br />not see through<br />shiny side stripe<br />breathable<br />soft<br />very good since they fit my long legs<br /><br />cons<br />high waisted yet the waist band is short<br />underwear lines<br />super thin (makes me feel cold)<br />i\\'d where these if they had the same fabric as my comfy soft sweats..... in a heart beat<br /><br />i just wish that these weren\\'t so thin and well these weren\\'t the type of fabric i hoped for but these are nice don\\'t get me wrong<br />(how ever they don\\'t look like the pic in my opinion since these are high waisted on me..)<br />(i will update my review if i see anything wrong) great purchase i love these pants i get a lot of complements by wearing them was just a little unhappy it did not fit..got the xl too small,i take an xl what happen...does it coe in xxl??? got a billion compliments!! very stylish love love love!! love the way they fit and the material and the price is very reasonable would buy more really like the fake denim very comfy and fit perfectly! these are wonderful funky pj pants for around the house & can even use speaker phone function with phone in the cell phone pocket. love these pants! very comfortable and love the color. awesome! the colors are beautiful and it looks like the picture online!! fits nice too! so soft and comfy! my only complaint is that they are really long. otherwise, great lounge pants. :) a bit small but they\\'re linen so they fit perfectly within an hour. love the color! super cute pants!!!!! wore them with a white tee and it looked really good, got a lot of complimentes :) i wish the fit was a bit more tight and girly. it\\'s still cute and what i expected, it was supposed to take a while also and came earlier than expected. all around worth it. ordered a small and i wasn\\'t able to fit a leg in. brand probably runs pretty small. just a heads up for when you\\'re deciding on size! :) excelent wore this jumper already and it fit very nice , good quality material must buy. you have to wear an inside top to compliment the jumper these pants are very cute. the color is vibrant and the material is high quality. i normally wear a 12, but many reviews said these run small, so i ordered a 14. they fit great. i highly recommend them but order a size larger than you normally wear. the colors are vibrant and the pants are well made. i am considering purchasing another pair. i love these pants. i\\'m 5 9 so it\\'s a challenge trying to find pants that are long enough, and these are definitely long. shipping was fast. super comfy as well. i usually wear a large and i got an extra large so there a tad bit big. so i think they fit true to their size. i\\'m a tall woman and i\\'m always suprised when something fits. i wish they had been just a tad longer, but i\\'m 6\\'2&#34; and i really can\\'t complain! they\\'re keepers, very flowy and cool and forgiving of my extra pudge that i haven\\'t been able to shed since having a baby. i wear a size small and it fit to size. got lots of compliments. i purchased another color after this one. too short in length but otherwise fits great! love the feel of the material. beautiful pant! the fit and look of the pants is exactly as you see it in the picture. the fabric is thin and flowing, but also slightly sheer. may need to coordinate underwear the same color as the fabric of the pant so it blends in. i\\'m not that risqué ;) pants fit perfect, very comfortable! i love the jean on these and they fit very well i was not sure because i wear a 17 yet they only had 11 yet they fit great. bought these for my girlfriend to use as protection and to use on adventure races. there is little to no compression but they hold out well in the bush and on rough terrain. the durability is comparable to other much more expensive tights. highly recommend unless you\\'re looking for compression. beautiful print and very comfortable. a size small was just fine for my 5\\'4&#34; 125 pound frame 5\\'9&#34; tall, leggy, lanky and wear a size 4 long or extra long  jean/pant.  these fit a little tighter in the hip than most size 4s i\\'ve purchased lately - this is a good thing in my case because all my curves are above the waist, but if you\\'re curvier in the hips, butt or thighs, you might want to order a size up.  i love these already - the length is perfect they hug the hip at such a comfortable position, not too low, not too high and they look so fabulous on!  i bought them ahead for spring and summer, but i probably won\\'t wait that long to wear them! thank goodness these came in today because it is freezing! they fit perfectly, i\\'m 5\\'9&#34; and 190lbs, they\\'re a little snug up top but that has nothing to do with the pants--that would be my uhm..err..winter pudge. but the pants are great, warm as heck! long too, i never find pants long enough but these are just the right length, haven\\'t washed them yet but so far so good. it was a perfect fit. not too tight or too loose. sizing was as expected. loved the color, exactly as the photo. would definitely recommend this the family and friends. got this for a costume! but it fits so well and is super comfy.  i am 5\\'3&#34; 170\\' fits great! i got the extra large and they are loose and look right - a wee bit long, but makes the baggy look perfect. i ordered a large, and they fit perfectly. just enough flare at the bottom. i love the feel of the fabric. arrived early. i will be ordering another pair. thanks its great and kind of comfy i love  it i enjoy all the products i purchase from amazon they are amazing. beautiful, comfy & true to size very comfortable amazing! it\\'s a tight fit it\\'s just revealed a little bit to much of my front but other then that i have no complaints fantastic quality with incredible price<br />these pajama pants are the best jammies ever! it\\'s cute and made with great material! i wish i had ordered more. love these pants. i originally wanted the mocha, but they were out of stock in my size so i bought the burgundy. they are so soft and lightweight. they are perfect for florida when you can\\'t wear shorts.  i kept the mocha in my &#34;cart for later&#34; so i could quickly and easily keep watching for them to be available.  the mocha are a perfect neutral color and look great on.  the color is perfect for pairing with summer colors.  they wash great, and come out of the dryer fine.  they do wrinkle easily, but the wrinkles come out when you wear them similar to a t-shirt. they are quick and easy to iron if you\\'re headed out of the house and want to look sharp and wrinkle free.  these pants are comfy, great looking, easy to maintain, very affordable, and solidly stitched. i\\'m glad i have two pair. now i just need to decide what other colors to buy for the rest of the week. great pants! delivered within good time. however they tear easily..i guess cuz its faux leather. im hoping the cleaners can restore them. love it. the material isn\\'t as good as some expensive brands like black milk pants, but is solid for the price. the seams also are noticeably visible, and can be aesthetically annoying. the galaxy colors are nice though, and again it\\'s priced very reasonably for the value you receive. i love these pants that are very comfortable and stylish as well. nice quality and fits perfectly these are my favorite ! it was everything i expected and i get a lot of compliments on it , i\\'d recommend these pants to anyone really light material, my niece loved them and uses them to sleep in. nice, the size was exactly very well, not too short not too large, so you can use them with sandals and it will be ok, it is a little light and because the color, yes you can see a little bit your underwear through the pans, but nothing bad, so if you do not want that, you can always ask for darker color. love it!! for mother in memory care.  warm and comfortable.  5\\'7&#34; 130 lbs.  slightly roomy.  she has thin legs. these pants are comfortable fit well and look nice enough for work as well as yoga. will probably order more as they just sent me their catalog. love these pant.  very comfortable.  i am 5\\'7 and the length is perfect. these pants fit very nice.  i purchased two pairs in the large.  the fit was slightly fitted but it wasn\\'t tight.  they are a nice thin summer pant.  not see through but a nice summer pant.  the pant is slightly long but i plan on wearing them with my heels so the length was perfect for me.  i did not have to hem them.  you can also fold the waist down to shorten the pant as well.  i am very satisfied with my purchases these are cute, but a little small. i like the pattern and the fit, but they could be an inch or two longer. i\\'m 5\\'9 with a 32inch inseam, they do tell you the inseam is 30inches but the waist band is so thick/wide that i was hoping to be able to wear them on my hips (where i normally wear my pants anyway) and have them fall at the right length. they\\'re super comfortable and still cute so i\\'ll keep them - they\\'re for glamping anyway, but they are too short and a little too thin to wear in public. wife loves them i purchased the robe, slippers, and top with full confidence that i could find the pants in my size at another store or online. the store only has tiney sizes in the pants.  i need the pants to finish my set.  when are you going to get more? i love these yoga pants! when i first opened them and help them up i thought, oh crud...too small!!! but then i tried them on and they actually fit perfectly. the colors are beautiful and i get complements on them. they wash well, too. i love these pants. they fit as expected. excelent! i wear these everwhere and they always look new.<br />these are a great travel pant and with a nice top and heels, can be used for formal wear too. nice pant great quality for relaxing around the home they are a perfect pair of comfy pants! i haven\\'t worn these as yet.  however, they are soft and very pretty.  i will find a top that compliments these pants. great thank you the leggings are cute but not as pictured. i received a pair of leopard print leggings that have a metallic gold on them. i didn\\'t want to deal with the hassle of sending back for exchange/refund so i kept them. overall i\\'ll probably order from this company again but only because they sent a coupon with my order. thanks i love these scrub pants!  i opened the package to try them on and didn\\'t want to take them off! going to order more! i love it, materials is okay but with the price you pay though...been asked a lot where i got it.. i\\'m not an athlete, but needed something warm i could pull on quickly so i can walk our very energetic dog throughout the winter months.  i found these, the reviews were good and the price was good so i grabbed them.  i\\'m 5/4&#34;, 150.  i bought a women\\'s large. the were a bit long, which i expected, but they have a band around the ankle that i put around the top of my shoes so they stay off the ground. they fit elsewhere, except when i wear them over my jeans, they are a little snug in the seat.  the waist has velcro adjustments and are pretty flexible as to the waist size.  there is also a velcro closure over the zipper/snaps in the front.<br />the best part is that they are so warm.  i only wear them when it goes below freezing.  they keep my legs warm for the whole walk. (my dog wears a coat too). i have also worn them shoveling snow and when i go out taking photographs.  they repeal snow and drizzle.  i like the deep zipper pockets on the side.  (the ones i got don\\'t have cargo pockets).  i think they will hold up for several seasons. these fit my waist perfectly.  i wear a size 6 or 8.  i am 5\\'5&#34;.  these are very long on me.  next time i will order theses in petite.  the fabric is really luxurious and unique.  it has a great stretch to it and somehow has weight. i got so many compliments with these pants! great quality i would recommend. it\\'s very comfortable and i just love them. love it the fabric is very nice and flowing, the quality is great. but maybe because of the fabric being too stretchy, the pants feel too large and at times i\\'m almost losing them. the slacks are comfortable and soft.  they are about 1-1.5 inches too long for me (i\\'m 5\\'6&#34;) and did not shrink much when dried.  they do wrinkle some, but not awful. luv these pants. lots of compliments!! nice and thin, very breathable but balls very quickly. love love love these!! this is one of my fav outfits it is very comfy and its just the color i wanted love them want to get a few more such comfortable, easy to wear pants...love them! i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; and 125 lbs, and the small fit perfectly. they have a hem so they can\\'t be cut to fit, but that\\'s ok because i can adjust the length at the waist to wear with either low or high wedges. nice, flowy material that washes great, and i just hang them to dry to keep them looking good. cozy!! these pants are so nice and comfy!! i could wear them all day. i am 5\\'9 170lbs. with a big butt! i loved the way they hugged that area. i ordered a m&l and they both fit the same but the l was longer. i wish i would have ordered more than three, but i will prob order more soon. i have not worked out in them yet. i am going to a crossfit training session in a few days. i will try to remember to let you know how they held up. great pants! i\\'m 5\\'9 and didn\\'t have trouble with the length, they are perfect whether if i want to wear them near my heels or by my calves. also there is no problem at all if you have a thin or big waist. totally recommend these, nice quality cotton and awesome price. beautiful pants..great fit.. love it just ordered more colors i wish the cell phone pocket was on top of the cargo side pocket instead of on top of it. i am short and it make it hard to reach the larger side pocket. my iphone5 fits in the cell pocket perfectly. i have a 30&#34; inseam and the knee patches are a bit low, but not too low. vove it sooo comfy! they\\'re perfect i love these so lightweight and free flowing, i plan on getting more and i hope this company expands the color selection. the size i pickedfit me very well. this one is a bit bulgy up front, but otherwise fits well.  however, i should have ordered them sooner, because they will be put away soon for the next fall, and winter. good quality. order 2 sizes up for a better fit. i\\'m waiting for restock, so i can order more ! very comfortable, but fabric may pill a bit. would not recommend washing in the washer with other clothes, because it could make the fabric pill even more. thanks these pants/tights are high waisted (no muffin top!) and have the perfect proportion of stretch versus structure! they look fairly professional but you could kickbox with them! good they are plenty long in the leg, without being to long in the crotch which is many times the case when you order tall.  good construction and very soft as this brand is known for.  all my scrub pants currently with the exception of 2 are now koi i really do love the feel and fit of these. so comfy and soft!  however they really are very see-through as others have said.  i will have to wear a long top or tank top to cover my rear if i want to wear these in public.  i will still probably order another pair because i love them, but maybe just to wear in the house.  i am 5\\'7, 145 lbs and have most of my weight in my hips. i  purchased the black m but next time i will order l because i like to wear them low on my hips. like it. i wear them almost every day. great thicker material and fit. i am tall lady (5\\'9.5) and it well made to be proper length. it can be too long for shorter people tho. perfect for pilates or yoga as well. i normally wear a xxl or a 20 in jeans. i ordered these in an 18, after reading the other reviews. they fit perfectly! the material is soft and is not see thru, at all. i have not noticed any pilling of the fabric yet. i highly recommend! the pants look great and fit great. they are exactly the way the appear in the picture. excellent quality. great value. comfortable and nice for working out or lounging around the house. i loved it, super comfy and soft. would prefer the material a little more thicker but makes sense for the price i paid. after reviewing the sizing chart and falling right between medium and large i chose medium. i am 5\\'7 and weigh about 145lbs. the medium size is perfect. not too tight and not too large. if i were shorter, they would have been too long, but for me they drape perfectly. very pleased. the quality seems very nice and they are not too heavy and not too light. i will order more after i see how they wash. i had noticed that there are indications on this kind to hand wash if possible. i may try on delicate. nice material. lasted a lot longer than expected, or course leggings never last to too long. cat print is really cool. has upside down crosses, which i love you may not. i like this product a lot. i am small 90 lbs 4\\'11 and it was only a little loose on me. very happy the pants fit great and drape well. the only reason i gave it a four out of five stars is because the inseam near the inner thigh is already giving way. easy enough to sew, but a flaw nevertheless. the black is a deep black color and does not fade with washing. the waistband has a tendency to roll a bit, but that could be because mine are a bit big on me. these are nice inexpensive pants that i used for my jack frost cosplay. i bought a small which was very snug on me, i would not wear them for everyday use, i\\'d go with a larger size, but for cosplay purposes they are very good. there has been a great deal of attention given to the styling .  great quality denim. need to go up one size love it so comfy it gives a nice shape to the body i would order more like them so much, i had to buy a second pair. comfortable and stylish. i wear them on my early morning bike rides. they keep my legs warm and looking good. great i just got mine and they are so so soft!! i can\\'t say whether they run long or not since i\\'m 5\\'0 and hemming is always a requirement.<br /><br />i will say they run large. i ordered a small and was worried they\\'d be too tight but they were actually a little too big. i assume a wash/dry will shrink em down a bit. i heard they pill quick so i\\'m going to stock up and turn them inside out when i wash them.<br /><br /> i\\'m normally a size 3/4. i think the small is good for a size 5 or 6. great value! so nice i will get every color love the fit and the pattern. i\\'m average sized and these fit as expected. very light and flowy. love these are the most cozy well fitted leggings i have ever bought. i happened across them luckily at a tj max and fell in love! i recommend these leggings above anything else i have ever had. i am ever wearing them in my pregnancy perfect fit still. great waist. i love my culottes !!! the fabric is lovely and the fit is perfect (i am a 12-14).  the waist is elastic so the fit would work for many sizes.  very cute and a great value. love them! fits perfectly and is  so soft...love it! excellent, i \\'m ordering a different sizes love the pants. i sometimes find the fabric to be too thick and hot but this material is light and had enough give. the waist size fit perfectly. love these! simple and easy for work no ironing required! a bit nervous that if i snag the material or my dog jumps on me the material will &#34;run&#34; and render these junk. ride a bit low and panties tend to show. i don\\'t have much of a behind so i would really caution those with big back sides...however for those with small frames these are awesome!! fortunately before to buy them i have asked the vendor which size should i go for and being a size s-m i have bought and xl that is ok for me. best maternity pants i have ever owned. they are really comfortable and great quality. i may buy more for after the baby\\'s birth. would highly highly recommend purchasing. the seller met my needs as expected, however although the pants fit perfect as i had ordered them they are 100% cotton and will shrink in the wash. i opted for going the next size up and am looking forward to the next shipment. i decided that it would be better to have the pants fit somewhat looser as i will be doing quite a bit of traveling.<br />the refund process through amazon make it easy to return items. these are really nice quality and design well worth the price they don\\'t want to stay up.  i constantly had to pull them up all day... but they\\'re comfortable and actually long enough. i got a large which is what i normally wear but they are tight. it\\'s ok because i\\'m in the process of losing weight but i suggest going a size up than what you are. also they are very very long! i\\'m 5\\' 2&#34; and they are way to long for me, which i don\\'t mind fixing them but keep that in mind. over all the material is amazing, very soft and stretchy.  also makes the booty look good lol i got so many compliments for these pants. people were literally stopping in the middle of traffic to ask where i got them they fit good and there not comfy as sweat pants but there really good for a pair of legging made out of that material, sometimes i find stretch pants a bit itchy but these ones were fine. i love it. comfortable,roomy, and stylish i loved the pattern, they were very comfortable. exactly what i was looking for love. love. love these pants. i love these. thet came in way faster than i expected. can\\'t wait to wear them to work tomorrow!!! and they\\'re mega comfy. they fit perfectly!! i will definitely be purchasing more :3 súper comfy! it fits great! looks exactly like the picture and it got here just in time! thanks :) these were bought for my daughter and she loved them they are really nice but i\\'m giving them 4 stars because the fade really fast, i\\'ve washed them on delicates around 4 times already and they look faded. i bought the black ones. i order size 16 like two sizes smaller and they fit good. super cute! i love these pants! they were kind of long but they ended up looking great on. i have gotten so many compliments. i would definently order again love them i think i found my new pair of fav leggings. silky soft and fit well im 5\\'4&#34; 120. very satisfied. these arrived very fast. they are wonderful. i usually order a large, but got an extra large because sizes from china usually run small. they fit fantastically. very comfy, easy to put on and lots of stretch. these are very flattering, and super comfortable. i was afraid they were going to be too baggy and too long, but they are perfect. will be buying more of these a christmas gift.  well loved. i bought the garter leggings, black with white crosses.  love them!!  they fit great, are made of a nice, silky fabric, and are sexy without being too revealing.  i\\'m 5\\'3&#34;, 120lbs.  can\\'t wait to wear them to a concert next week :) these are the 3rd pair of pants that i bought from this seller. the previous two were high waisted jeans. i absolutely love all of them. this pair is perfect for work. it hugs the curves in all the right places. its stylish and fits well. it is also really comfy. as a matter of fact, all of the pants i\\'ve purchased from this seller fit perfectly. the sizing charts are quite accurate. i will continue to buy from this seller. i\\'m so happy with my purchase! gorgeous! well-made, good quality fabric, and a nice drape. interesting shape..i get tons of compliments! waistband is small, which i like, as i am an hourglass. those with a bit of bulk in the middle will find these to be too small. fit perfectly. 5\\'5&#34;; wear about size 8-9. i loved these, my only problem was that the fabric started to pull and now theres tiny holes in the fabric that i cannot repair :c i just got these and wore once. they for and look great. i wear 12/14 pants normally, but have a small waist. i have other pairs of lysse, and for some reason the plain black ones do better.  i had a pair of brown that ripped after wearing once, and the denim ones wear out on the butt. will update if these do anything funky. goood i have really long legs so finding any pants long enough is a challenge, but these are awesome, i was so excited when they were actually long enough for me! i love this pant. the stitching detail is what makes it very cute!! extremely light weight which is perfect in the hot and humid weather of the south. the material is not see through.  may be long on person under roughly 5\\'8&#34;.  i got for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. love the movement of the pants, they feel wonderful and are the perfect length. i love these pants. they are super soft and comfortable. the fit is great- i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; and 130 lbs, if that helps. great! fit and feel good. i love the side pocket and they are very comfortable.  i really like the material as well perfect! i wish i could give this pair of leggings 10/10 stars. i\\'m 5\\'2&#34; with a 24&#34; waist & purchased the juniors size small. these pants fit like a dream. they\\'re tight but not too tight, very stretchy and most importantly, soft and extremely comfortable. it\\'s extraordinarily difficult for me to find jeans that fit me, as i always end up having to pay extra money to a tailor for adjustments that never come out just right, so i cannot impress on you enough just how elated i am to have finally found comfortable & beautiful jeans/jeggings. i will be purchasing more of these in different colours and will definitely stick to shopping from the mogan, as they have never disappointed me yet. the material is really nice and they seem the perfect size for gym. they\\'re a little baggy but it\\'s probably because i got an xl. and some of the reviews are right the xl fits like a medium or large. i do not have any words to say really.  they fit great, are a great length, and are very (very) comfortable.  i absolutely love them. i was expecting an elastic waist after viewing the picture, however they are actually a nice band and fit wonderfully. i have had these for less than two months and they are already tearing at the seams. these are pretty poor quality. they\\'re somewhat comfortable. they do run large as other reviewers stated, so i had been expecting that. since they are big and by no means tight, i was not expecting them to already be falling a part at the seams. i don\\'t recommend these.<br /><br />**update** so the manufacturer was very nice and replaced my pants. i wanted to wait a couple of months in order to give a fair review. this second pair definitely held up way better. no holes, no falling apart at the seams. i very much appreciate that texere silk cares about their products and customers and i am very happy to report that the first pair was just defective. thank you these pants are so modern and so chic!! i am so happy i bougt it and it was shipped super fast. i literally ordered it tuesday night and on thursday morning it was at my doorsteps sharp at 10:30. i would recommend this to the ladies looking for that hour-glass shape+ harem pants look. it tucks in the waist and makes you look very nice. great buy! see my review on the black tricotine pants as well! these dark denim pants are great dress jeans and at the price, buy an extra pair to wear just for running around! fantastic flattering fit, with great style. a stylish boot leg cut, and for me, the length was perfect (i\\'m 5ft.5in and bought the size 6).       i\\'ve purchased designer jeans for a ridiculous price simply because it is so frustrating trying to find a great fit. they were $198.00, fit great, but had to be hemmed, unfortunately after being hemmed and washed, now they are too short for my higher boot cut shoes that look best with them.       the issac denims are perfect to start with, with the right length, cut and style. . . . and the right price for all that!! finally, someone combined style and quality with an affordable price. i didn\\'t think it could be done! great jeans! they are see through, but look cute when paired with shorts or a skirt pretty good pants. there\\'s a pocket in the thigh area that was hard to see in the pics. they took over a month to get here, kind of frustrating. i\\'m 5\\'11, 155lbs and i ordered a large based on the reviews saying these were super small, i normally wear 8-10 or m. these fit great.  long enough for me, obvi i\\'m tall, and they actually do have stretch to them, so they\\'re loose at the end of the day. material is lightweight, i think if i tugged on them too hard they might bust some seems, but hopefully they stick around for awhile. very cute. sent them back and asked for a large. the sizes are smaller than us sizing. i wear a size 4/6 would like the material to be thicker...with that said i still like them and very comfortable i really liked these pants.  they felt really nice.  i ordered true to size, 18, hoping they would be snug like the picture.  they were too big, too long and very baggy in the legs.  i returned them at my cost for credit.  if you have nice curvy legs and hips and are taller than 5\\'2 and heavier than 160, the size 18 might work for you. i love these leggings, i bought them on impulse, but they were only $10.99 so whatever. going off the other reviews that said they run small, i ordered them a size up and they fit like i thought they would, they\\'re super comfortable as well, and not too hot. the colors are fabulous and i definitely recommend them to anybody like me who hates wearing real pants and just wears leggings instead. i abolutely love these pants!  i own four pairs already, and i am currently about to order 4 more pairs.  they run very big.... i am usually a size 9/10, and the size small fits me perfectly (if you want a snug fit), and the medium is fine too if you want them baggy (three of my pairs are med, which ride really low on the hip on me, my waist is about 30\\\\\\\\\" and my hips are about 40\\\\\\\\\", and as i said the size small is a nice snug fit, but still comfy, not uncomfortably tight).  the 8 pockets are great!  they are so versatile, you can wear them to work (if you have a semi-casual environment), as they look great with a button down shirt or a cute little babydoll top, but they are also great for anything athletic you might do (i rollerblade and ride a bike pretty frequently and these are my favorite pants to wear).  the drawstring waist is perfect so you don\\'t need a belt and the drawstrings at the ankle are perfect to tie them up at the knee if you want a makeshift capri.  i love these pants! quite comfortable and love that not too long.  fabric is heavier weight than i expected but still like them a lot.  5\\'4&#34;. we bought these to cut in strips to make houndstooth headbands for my girls. material was as i hoped- stretchy and lycra and did exactly what i hoped when we cut them into bands they wear with their pony tails playing sports. we are big u of al fans and love all things crimson and houndstooth! my son loves them! i ordered the white pair in a us size 3, and i just received them today after about a week 1/2 of waiting. i checked the tag because the shorts looked on the smaller size and the tag says us size 4....which is clearly not a size 3. these look more like a size 1 to me. unless they were made to fit small on you. they arent as flowy around my legs as i would\\'ve hoped, but they aren\\'t tight around them either. the fit isnt bad. they come with a sheer liner inside, but dont wear brightly colored underwear because the liner is very sheer. as long as you are wearing a nuder/grey/white pair of panties, you wont see anything. the material isnt amazing, but its not bad..i will def have to hand wash these because i can see the material being torn to shreds in the washer/dryer. i recommend ordering one size up if you want a flowy fit...if you want them to be a little form fitting/with some flow at the bottom, then order them in your regular size. for reference, i typically wear a size 1/3 26/27 in shorts/pants, and i ordered these in a 3 and they fit fine, i just wish they were a bit flowier.<br />i also ordered the black pair in a us size 1 and holding them up to the white pair i got in a us size 3, they are the same exact size.<br /><br />update: after wearing them out, ive noticed that the under lining of the shorts can ride up when youre wearing them. they can make it look like you are wearing underwear underneath a crochet pair of shorts. if thats something you can deal with then go for the purchase! i did find these very comfortable and i plan on pairing them with a grungy band tee! i can wear them as dress pants for work or just pants around the house. no matter what they are so comfortable. i own about 4 pairs. they came in 4 days they fit perfect!! they are great a little tight around the waist but other than that they fit good. great for the price comfortable with great fit. comparable to vs yoga pants but thinner material, which may be desirable in warmer weather. i am 5\\'4&#34; 120lbs and ordered a size small, perfect fit with no see through issues. very comfortable to wear..looks like real jeans from afar.. they were for my granddaughter and she said, she loves them. these fit very well and where i will have to hem them slightly they are the most comfortable pants i have ever purchased or wore. i just received these pants today, have to return them. before ordering, i asked a question &#34;what is the waist size on 1x&#34; and received no reply. wasn\\'t sure what size to order, so i ordered 2x...way too big, length is perfect, i\\'m 5\\'3&#34;. reordered large, hope they fit. mateial and workmanship are very nice. size large is still to big in the upper thighs. it\\'s to expersive to keep ordering, and returning. i think the seller should pay for shipping on return, since it is not my fault that they run so big. not sure what i will do. i really like these pants. great fit.  will buy again this is the only &#34;petite&#34;/elastic waist  pants that i have been satisfied with. i la-la-la-la-laav these pants. soo comfy with soft fuzzy warmth inside. the best part is the pockets!! the entire stars are pockets and it is so roomy!! i get complimented on these pants all the time. would have given five stars if the quality was better but you can tell it is cheaply made. for the price you cant really complain, you get what you pay for. these pants went perfectly with a holloween costume i bought.  the costume i bought was a little too on the skimpy side for me so these pants added the touch of coverage and class that i needed. great purchase. just want i wanted i have a pair of these scrub pants for work and i love them! they are easy to clean and never need ironed. i\\'m so glad i found them again since my local uniform store doesn\\'t carry them anymore. fits the pants were not as loose as i wanted. but i like the i love the pants, they are just a little higher rise than i expected. very soft denim so it will stretch throughout the day. love them very nice arrived in good time. good fit and they stay nice after several washings. they were a gift and she was very happy with them. issac, you\\'ve outdone yourself!!! these are the cutest seeksucker pants and 1st pair i\\'ve ever purchased and i am so very pleased with them!! these pants are tailored to perfection!   the fullness of the leg and they sort of flare a little, which i was really impressed with. throw them on with a cute white mossimo t-shirt and a pair of keds and you\\'re set. to cute!! i absolutely love these pants.  they feel nice, are light weight and i have received may complements.  i am going to start buy a pair a month so i have all colors!!! love cotton.......fit is perfect and leggings well made.....i want to wear them all of the time!!!!! i received lots of compliments. they are comfy too excellent product i order this pajama set in medium and i must say i absolutely love it!... great buy, i think i am going to get this in other colours if they have it. the fit is classy and comfortable at the same time...love it!! i absolutely love these they are very breathable, super comfortable and just perfect.<br />highly recommend them.<br />just ordered pretty much every color they make except white since i live in a red sandy desert. these pants fit me well. they are very well made and are comfortable.  i appreciate having the convenience of online shopping as this style of pant are difficult to find in my area. great purchase.  very happy with this transaction i prefer cotton to all other materials, so finding leggings that are 95% cotton and inexpensive was a find. these are just heavy enough that they look good worn our in pants. i\\'m going to look for more by this company.<br /><br />four stars because they run a bit tight, and the cotton is pilling a bit. the real test who\\'ll be after they are washed - review will be updated then. my wife loves them. had to buy a second pair already. very nice! they fit perfect, but aren\\'t actually for a 27-29 waist size. the size chart given isn\\'t totally correct. i need more run on in the hip area , a big size. instead of a large i need an x-large the fabric is thick and sturdy, the pattern is really kooky cat lady, which is the look i was going after great! i love it i love that! recipient was very grateful. these pants are very comfortable, and at the same time professional.  they stretch perfectly and fit wonderfully.  worth the money! i am really happy with these pants. they are perfect. the reviews say they run big, so i bought a medium instead of a large. they fit great. so comfortable! love the bright colors and the fit. i liked the fit. they are great for wearing around the house thanks for the order! nice pants i do not wear these out in public because i feel like i look like i have an adult diaper on. however! these are probably the most comfortable sweatpants that i have ever worn. they aren\\'t lightweight, but they aren\\'t heavy. they are very fun to dance in (i do zumba at home), but if you do use these for dancing you will sweat. they don\\'t breath too great. arrived in good time, wrapped well and a buy never regreted. they fit easy, and when you put on the loose fitting linen you feel unbound in every way. a super buy! very nice palazzo pants. fit is perfect!! extremely long so, if your tall, these will be perfect. easy enough to cut off the length and requires no hem. they arrived much earlier than anticipated, which was great, however these don\\'t fit at all even though i ordered the size i normally wear. they are way too small. i will say that they look like they are nice pants. very comfortable and soft. it\\'s what i\\'ve been looking for. thank you having been a size 10 regular for years that is the size i requested in exchange for an honest review. they fitted well so i was pleased. now i will say that if you have to squeeze into a size 10 then this size will likely not work for you as they are quite snug around the tops of the legs but i can wear them comfortably. please note that these are low rise, non stretch, jeans with a small zip (less than 4&#34;). as another reviewer has pointed out, the button hole is not cut for you which i found a little strange and certainly inconvenient.<br /><br />the jeans are made of a soft denim, not thick but not too thin. the back seat of the jeans and front from the top of the legs to the knees have a deliberate worn look to them. the two front pockets are lined with a black and white check pattern and have two rivets on each pocket. (there are no other rivets.) definitely wide legs measuring approximately 11&#34; across with a 1&#34; hem. the back pockets are deliberately creased and actually sewn in two parts. standard &#34;orange&#34; stitching on most external seams.<br /><br />what don\\'t i like about them? they stink! i highly recommend you washing these before wearing them as they have a strong smell even after 24 hours of being out of the package. also there is no size label on the jeans or if it is present it is in chinese as there is a care label. soft and pajama-like, very pretty. a tiny bit short for my 5\\'9&#34; height in size m but will do fine as a comfy pant. i tried them on and they are perfect for me. i  also like how they feel. nice material and love the design.  i am 5\\'7 and the pants fall right above my ankle.  wish they were a little bit longer. got these for a 90 year old lady. she wears them around the house many days & loves them. i was given this product for a reduced price in exchange for my honest review. i love love this leggings. it is cute and very comfortable!!!! i just ordered 2 more pair, these really are the best. added bonus (if you have cats): cat hair does not stick to them. love the pants just a little big fun prints. soft and comfortable as well. so happy that i purchased them !! medium fits well (5\\'3&#34; 120 lbs)! very comfy! this is a fairly nice scrub set.  the material is a little different than most of my scrubs, but it seems nice.  i believe it won\\'t require too much ironing, but i\\'m not sure yet.  the neck line is fairly low, but not horrible.  i like the band around the waste and the numerous pocket.  all that detail helps it look much less plain.  overall a good purchase. super comfy. love these! these fit really well and are pretty opaque. they do seem to be becoming worn from the washer more quickly then most of my yoga pants in the past have however. overall, they\\'re just a good and simple set of yoga pants. i remember the days of heavy levis when we tried to beat them and bleach them into submission. these jeans fit well and look really nice. but i felt the fabric was a tad thin. they do stretch quite a bit, but i think a solid cotton would last longer. still, they are well worth the money. love them great product,fits and looks fab. bought this as a gift for my girlfriends sister, and she loves it! the pants i purchased arrived a day earlier then the shipping i selected so that helped me wrap it all in time for christmas.  the pants were so soft & fluffy both on the inside and out!  i bought them for my sister and she wore them right away.  great for laying around the house and/or running errands.  price was great since you get 2 pairs- can\\'t beat that! i purchased these yoga pants just a  few days after paying $55 for similar pants at victorias secret. upon receiving these pants,  i regretted having spent so much more for something so similar at vs!  the quality is a bit inferior to vs,  but the value for the money is far superior! these yoga pants fit perfectly (i ordered a large & i\\'m 5\\'4\\\\\\\\\" and 165 with most of my chubbiness concentrated in my stomach ;-) ) & the material is of pretty decent quality. i am definitely satisfied with my purchase good buy for the money. it\\'s hard to find scrubs that fit me.  i\\'m barely 5 feet and about 105 lbs, dress size around 00, so i\\'m more on the petite side.  the only scrubs i found at scrubs and beyond that fit me (without looking like i was wearing a potato sack) were the grey\\'s anatomy scrubs in xxs petite.  i took a chance on these pants because of the prime free shipping/returns.  and i\\'m so glad i did!<br /><br />they are exactly like grey\\'s anatomy scrubs without the $30 price tag!<br /><br />ultra soft isn\\'t as soft as grey\\'s, but it is soft enough and doesn\\'t feel stiff and polyester-like.  the flat front and elastic back half prevents me having to raise and re-tie my pants throughout the day.  (the drawstring is more for looks.)<br />i bought these pants to replace my grey\\'s pants in this wine color.  and you can\\'t tell that the pants aren\\'t grey\\'s even when i wear the grey\\'s scrub tops.<br />in conclusion, if you like grey\\'s anatomy scrubs, get these instead! wore these pants all day and they were comfy. love these pants.  soft.  fit perfectly. just love them. i bought these to wear with a costume but i can hardly stand to take them off! i am wearing them to yoga and around the house they are so comfy. i am 5\\'2 and weight 110 and they fit perfect. they are snuggly inside but not overly fleecy or hot. i am ordering another pair! i was looking at the other reviews for these pants and have to agree- these are the best! i am a tall women and it is nice to have pants that actually go over my sneakers. the material offers a snug fit and keeps things in line. a friend of my calls them my skinny pants so, i tend to wear them alot. i would love to know if they come in different colors cause if they did i would buy them all. love these! the white are only a teeny bit see through. it\\'s super hard to find white yoga pants that don\\'t show  too much. these are thick enough to just barely see any lines. i think the material would have to be way too thick to not show any line, so i thought they were perfect. i usually wear a small, ordered the medium per the reviews, and i\\'m glad i did. these are honestly the pants. they are so comfortable and light, but thick enough to keep my legs warm. i wore them to bed and didn\\'t think that was going to last because of the twisting of the legs. i didn\\'t have any issues with them through the night. that was a big issue of have with a lot of pants. also i didn\\'t think these would fit me either. i am between a 16w and 18w. i got the xxl and they are a perfect fit. i would recommend anyone that loves to be have comfy pants for around the house to purchase these it\\'s definitely worth it. i did read a lot of the 1 and 2 star review i didn\\'t experience any of those things. at least not yet. i\\'m going to really like these pants. i love the color of gray. they run about a size small. so order accordingly. i love these pants!  i was afraid of ordering the wrong size but i went with a small after reading other reviews.  i am 5\\'1&#34; and small but am wider in my hips and stomach.  they are so comfy especially with the fold-over waist.  i can wear these casually or dress them up.  i have to have them slightly hemmed however.  i like them so much i ordered them in 3 colors!  they are great for spring and summer because they are light.  i also ordered them in a lighter color but they are not see-through. so glad i purchased these pants.  fit great though i think they run a little big.  very slimming and comfortable.  they stretch in all the right places! i really like this item but it just came too small. awesome nice quality and comfortable. fits like a dream, and this particular colour(caribbean blue) was amazing... i am 5\\' 51/2&#34; tall.  these pants are way to long for me.  otherwise they fit great.  like the fabric.  they came in not hemmed.  maybe they are supposed to be really long.  you can pay someone to hem them are try to cut off or hem  by yourself. very timely, product was exactly as described. so far it is fine, hopefully it won\\'t shrink once i wash it. these are so comfortable and i have them in so many different colors and the best thing is they come in tall. i ordered these shorts so i can lounge around in the house in but i have gone out with them on and use them during my workouts.  the material is good - thicker than what i expected, which is nice - and it\\'s perfect for this summer heat because of how loose it is and because it breathes.  shipping will take awhile because it\\'s coming from thailand but haven been there, i can tell you that this is authentic.  plan on buying more in the future initial reaction after trying it on so comfy. i\\'m definitely getting this in different colors if you wear a size small get a large.. they were still a little snug on me. great customer service though! bottom line order 2 sizes up! love these pants!  i am 46, 5`2&#34; and 128 lbs...so some middle age thickness, and these pants fit/hang perfectly.  very light weight and comfy should be perfect for spring/summer. great pants!! fabric is awesome, washes well with no wrinkles. filt is nice! will definitely order this brand again love koi love the pants i got. they fit very well and are well made too. i just wish they had pockets, but i love the pants. thanks so much for getting them to me so quickly! very comfy, though somewhat big... dont go by your jean size since different brands have different sizes in comparison. im just using a clip to close up the size and will probably order a smaller pair another time depending on how they withstand general ware and tear. my elderly mother likes this brand. she likes this color and was very happy with the fit of the pants. it\\'s really soft and comfortable. other than the bunny ears coming off after the second wash, the pants are wonderful! very comfortable and not baggy looking at all. i purchased this for my mom and she loves it. she said it\\'s comfortable and she wants me to order more for her in other colors. my mom is picky about her clothes but these pants seem like they are made extremely well. i wish i would have bought another one! i use it when i go out on my daily walks. i just had a baby (7 weeks) and i had a c-section so i can\\'t lift any weights yet- the only exercise i can do right now is brisk walk. these shorts have been helping me to sweat all the extra water weight pregnancy brought upon my body. i already lost 5 lbs since i started using it (one week)- of course the shorts won\\'t do a miracle if you\\'re not eating healthy as well. very pleased!! i wish i bought two of these! perfect for price. order your size, i ordered one size bigger because of the reviews i read and it is a little big.<br />good price and comfortable just too thin to wear it as itself, i use it below the pants very happy i ordered thd largest pair but they were extremely small. however  they were really nice. very comfortable,  can wear it with the waistband folded down or up.  washed well with no shrinkage.  i am 5\\' 9&#34; and the length was perfect love it! i bought this for  my  mom and the product itself is great, but the sizing is way off. i had to order her a 3x, she normally wears an xl. very comfortable.  i wish the legs were more fitted.  they seem really baggy.  the waist sits just right.  i hate low rise on uniforms.  it bugs me to see all the younger girs butt cracks when they bend down in them.  totally not appropriate for work,  these pants do not do that! cons: these are good if you are average or below average height. a lot of people complained that they were too long! yea right. they must\\'ve been teeny tiny. i am 5\\'9 with long legs. i bought the large. they are flooding my ankles. if they don\\'t have an extra large, look for another brand.<br /><br />pros: they are comfortable and are working well as pj pants. these pants are so comfy & cool! love them but definitely wash first :-) so cute though many times i would wear a women\\'s small, i read the reviews and bought a medium, and they\\'re perfect... i\\'m definitely on the small side: 5\\'6&#34;, 127 lbs. keep in mind that the sizing for these is more like juniors sizing than women\\'s sizing.<br /><br />because of lupus, my legs look like crap. i can\\'t imagine what it would cost to have the many varicose and spider veins removed, and i was told they will continue to form anyway. it\\'s a shame, since i still look pretty good otherwise (for a 54 yr.old).<br /><br />i definitely bought these to swim in, and plan to pair them with a tankini top. afterwards, i realized that i could probably pair wear them as capri\\'s also. they seem to be very well made, so i\\'ve just ordered a second pair. if anything falls apart, i will post an update immediately. (of course, i don\\'t plan to put them in the dryer). i didn\\'t even have to wait a week to get these leggings, i recieved them very fast. they\\'re very comfortable and i get complimented all the time by the unique style. great bought these as a gift for my ailing mother-n-law.  she found them soft and adjustable enough to ease the tenderness in her abdominal area.  great item! good, a bit small, good for swimming, that\\'s what i needed them for and a good chocolate color, matches the top i needed it to match. these lounge pants are sewn well, the fabric is of high quality, colors & pattern look great & goldilocks in &#34;weight&#34;.  these are not winter wear nor are they meant to be.  they fit true to size and are long but for a 5\\'3&#34; woman they shrank enough to not have to be hemmed - an inch could still come off & they\\'d be fine.  recommend highly for 100% cotton which is becoming extinct. nice but is a lil bit short from the back .. it does run small im size 1 and a i order a médium and it fit me good bought these for my wife she loves the capri pants not exactly pants or shorts just right for her comfort this spring gave 5 stars because shes happy that they fit so well recommend to all women who like to be comfortable yet stylish my size usually 12 or l. pants where too tight-fitting for me. i\\'m a size00 i got a small just a little big but still love them fit great and fast shipping the only thing wrong was  there was no button hole had to make on myself but they did give me $5 back cuz of it best scrub pants out there by far!  i\\'ve tried them all and koi is too notch! super comfy! love them! good price good product love love love!!! my mother loves these capris and wears them often. i\\'m 5\\'9&#34; and i have a large butt and thighs. all pants are usually a little snug in the thighs but these pants fit perfectly!  i ordered an xl in plum and it seems to be true to size. also i was afraid it would show my &#34;hail damage&#34; but it doesn\\'t. the fabric is super soft and stretchy and very comfortable. i will buy more! these pants are adorable.  i am wearing them as part of a halloween costume (red princess jasmine).  they appear in person as photographed.  i would warn though, that if you are not thin, they will not fit.  i am 5\\'6&#34;, 115 lbs. and they fit just right on the waist.  if i were wider, they would be too tight. love them!! i\\'m normally a size 29 in guess jeans. this 29 is not even close. i order again sizes 32 and 31... i hope one of them fit me because these  jeans are not only very cozy but they look very good too. very well made. the fleece inside is very soft. these are great! very flattering. i\\'m 5\\'6&#34; 145 & hour glass shape. fabric is light, but not too thin. the only complaint is that they were about 3&#34; too long. nothing a little hemming can\\'t fix, but short & avg height buyers... just a heads up. i loved  them! bought these for a comfortable pant for a race next weekend...but oh my are these see-through.  i bought the white ones for the color run and after putting them on i think i will buy a thicker material to wear underneath to hide any unmentionables...ahem...they fit wonderful minus being a little too long (i\\'m 5\\'3) but the large size (weight 175) is perfect and they really do make you look more slimming.  i just wish the material was thicker, but hey for the price great pair of pants and can\\'t wait to wear them to even just lounge around the house and do yoga. finally found good quality, soft flannel pants that are still long enough after washing.  they wash beautifully and i love them. for those sleepers who move frequently in the night (or the elderly) these pants allow easier change of position for a better period of rest.  use flannel pants and sheets if you never move, otherwise end up like a link sausage.  these pants are a better alternative! i bought one pair and then another one for my mom. she loves it . wash and wear and super comfortable to wear. good around the waist, legs on large are a bit too short. i like the fitting but stitches comes out. it fit good . i just want the cheerleading shirt navy blue . i ordered the black ones and they are perfect for the most beautiful price.<br />these are comportable and will serve me well. i will recommend these to my friends. these pants are exceptional for many reason...they look great with a piping down the legs.  pants look ironed even after washing!  they give my butt a lift and look amazing! comfy too.<br /><br />only drawback....no pockets:( so comfy and cute. best pair of scrub pants i\\'ve found! it fits really well i\\'m 5\\'2  n weigh 160 and i wear pants size like a 12p and 14p depending on the fabric. i ordered an xl bcuz of the reviews i read and it it\\'s great!! i\\'m short so there is a bit of extra at the ankles but nothing a fold on the legs can\\'t fix :) really good and comfortable fabric and the color was like a bright type of red just like i wanted. these pants were a great price and fit well.  i love the bright color at the top.  i got the lime yellow and will order more colors when i am need of some new yoga pants!  i would say they fit pretty true to size too. i love these pants! so comfy and they fit perfectly! there perfect, they fit me perfectly after my pregnancy. and they are my first ever yoga pants. i highly recommend them. great fit. would use this vendor again b i love yoga pants but have a hard time finding any that are long enough for my legs. i\\'m only 5\\'6&#34; but i have a 32&#34; inseam. most yoga pants are 29 or 30 inches which looks awful on me. finding a &#34;tall&#34; that was well made (kirkland\\'s yoga pants hold up better and are better quality than most name brands i\\'ve tried) was a treat. i read reviews but decided to find out for myself.  i\\'m 5\\'4&#34;, 125 pounds and usually wear a size 4.  the size chart states that the small is equivalent to a size 4-6.  this was totally wrong.  they were way too small.  the length was good but they fit like a size 0.  they offered free returns so i printed the shipping label and dropped the package off at the ups store. my refund was processed in a couple of days. i was very pleased with that!  i ordered  a large in this same color and also black. they fit perfectly. they are very soft, comfortable and warm--and also very cute.  they are surprisingly sturdy. i love these. they are thin and stretchy and super comfy. slightly see through on the pink part but not a big deal depending on underwear.<br />i give them 5 stars :) i love the fit i love these. they fit perfect and are so comfortable. i would love to have more! somewhat small in the hips but the rest fit perfect.  nice and heavy. large is not very large. fabric is nice. this is the cutest thing ever!!!  it makes me feel beautiful and elegant when i wear it!!! it showed  up on time and as described would def buy from this seller again! they are  very comfortable and they were just what i expected  but i drop a star on them because the couch was so deep.  the first time i put them on to measure the hem,  i found that i had to pull them all the way up to my bra line. so i had to take that couch in and not hem them. fine now. fits true to size and its what i expected. no complaints about it thank you! i love them! omg i got these pants and they were perfect. i can\\'t stop feeling them they are so soft. they are. very good pants and they are super cute. i have had them for two years and they are still just beautiful and perfect. i have bought three more after this pair. a bit small in the hips but not enough to move up a size. comfortable and good looking. love, so comfy! plan to order another pair in different color. i love it!!!!! these scrubs are very comfortable and i am short so it is great they have them in petite.  i love how they feel on you and they keep their color good don\\'t fade as much as other scrubs i have had.  i now will only buy grey\\'s anatomy and amazon always has them for a good price. there isn\\'t really elastic in the waist of these pants, but that\\'s okay.  when i was smaller, i folded the top down over my hips, and now that i\\'m bigger, i pull the top up over my belly.  these are very comfy pants.  i have been using them as jammies.  i wouldn\\'t really recommend going out in them though! very nice, exactly as described it\\'s very hard not to wear these leggings every single day , they are incredible, they came perfectly intact, no rips, tears, or holes. i wash them in the washer and hang them to dry, but even after so many washes there is absolutely no change in the quality of this item, they are true to size which as stated is &#34;one size fits all&#34; i am a size 4 and they fit me comfy, not too tight and not too loose. i thought they were a unique buy once i saw them, but after buying and wearing them in public the amount of compliments i receive on these leggings are endless. people love them because well like i said they are entirely unique to each individual, so many ways you can make these it into your own style, i highly recommend, the shipping is length so if you want them for a special date i would suggest buying ahead...a month ahead, just as the estimate says is when you will get them. extremely soft and fits so nicely! would love to buy in more colors. loved it. the blouse was a bit too long. a good fit though these pants are perfect for a warm vacation getaway or the summer.  lightweight and comfortable.  very flattering on. i went with the other reviews and ordered one size larger than my usual size.  i\\'m glad i did.  i wish they had more available! i love these pants. they are great quality. very beautifully made. delivery was great. i ordered them to big. but they are comfy. i just had to shorten themto wear around the house. love the pants.      ps. i just got a pair of smaller pants and they are great. i love it but to small these leggings are awesome. they\\'re super comfy and stretchy. the graphics are pretty clear too. and they were delivered earlier than i expected. great buy. the color is same as the photo. came in just a few days, not restricting at all and it fits perfectly. i was super excited to find this on amazon!! i have been eyeing this jumper since i first spotted it in zara a while back, but it was too much for my pockets.  when i found this on amazon i was sooooo happy that i immediately ordered despite the bad reviews.  and i do not regret it.  i have prime which means that i was eligible for free shipping and returns so i had a bit more flexibility.  i ordered the large and thought it was okay but decided to order the medium to test the fit of that and it fit like a dream. i returned the large with no hassle.<br /><br />fit: i am not sure why others are having issues with the fit, since i feel that it fits true to size.  i am regularly a medium and that is the size i have.  the top sheer and open in the back and almost sheer in the front, but nothing scandalous.  i have to wear a bra since i am blessed in that area but i will just cover the bra with a flesh toned bandeau.  the bottom is lightweight and as with most white clothing you cannot expect to wear bright or patterned underwear and not have it show...stick to neutrals.<br /><br />all in all i can\\'t wait to wear this in the summer with fabulous heals and a rocking clutch.  i already have it styled in my mind... these leggings are fun for the price. the shipping time really is as long as they state,-4-6 weeks. these tights would work much better on skinny small ladies but i am able to fit my lovely size 16 body into them. the only hitch for larger ladies is that due to stretching the colors look lighter and faded-not crazy and bright like the photo! i would definately not wear these as just pants. they for sure need to be under a skirt or dress. this skiny jean is very comfortable and looks skinny too<br />im wearing us size 10 .i got a large.<br />this is  very good stretchable...happy^^ !! i\\'m so happy with this pants ,they are so unique and very beautiful thank you short fit but very comfy - beware: these are somewhat see-through! they fit great! and there very comfortable i highly recommend these fit pretty well,i haven\\'t washed them yet so i hope they will still fit afterwards. wide leg very comfortable these pants are soooo comfortable!  i bought them to wear to a wedding reception and they were great - so soft and comfy!  they were too long but they were so easy to just cut 6&#34; off each leg -- no hemming required!  would recommend these to anyone wanting a dressy pant that is comfy and flowing. i\\'m not used to stretch slacks so these will take some adjustment.  they are super slinky and look great on! the plus sizes run way too large.  i purchased another pair in a smaller size (pxl) and they fit fine.  great styling and very comfortable for summer. fun pants, fit as expected according to the sizing given by the seller. perfect for summertime parties. i changed the little fuzzyballs on the end of the ties for lime green tassels, but that\\'s my personal preference. you don\\'t really even need the ties, they\\'re more for appearances. i purchased these in all black. they are long on me so i just hemmed the back part to wear with tennis shoes.they have a lot of stretch and don\\'t lose it as the day goes on as is the case with other inexpensive yoga pants. you can actually see the spandex if you are in the sun or direct light. the black ones are totally opaque but lets face it, they are yoga pants and are going to be tight on your thighs and derriere. they are comfortable and the fold over part on top is not a super thick fabric adding extra bulk to the waist. these have a good flair on the bottom as well to balance out the shape. these are a decent, inexpensive purchase. this i a very nice pants it fits perfect,wish there were more in other colors ,then only brown and black. came before i expected this pair of women\\'s plus size pants are great. they fit perfectly, feel really comfortable and can be worn in a dressy or casual way. thanks! excellent product for a great price i\\'m a size 20 and the 2xx was too large.. go down one size... it looks great and no binding.. great for the beach. very good loved how different it looks very nice i loved and no take to longer to delivered to me cool :)) had to cut some off the bottom, but they fit great i just loved it, very pretty, confortable and cheap.  very well done, and the size fits perfect for me, i am 25 and my weight is around 130lb, i asked for small size. very happy with this pijama :) love them this is my second time ordering yoga pants from here and i love them. they fit just right. love the material. better than the ones i buy from walmart & target. will order my next pair from here again. i\\'m in a wheelchair all day and usually sweatpants are not long enough. these are a perfect length for my 5 foot 8 body. they are loose fit and very comfortable. not hot at all. i bought this pair and like them so much i purchased the grey and black pairs as well. great price & look. i really like these pants. i wish i could have kept them! i got exactly what i bought. it shipped very fast and the pants is thin but very soft not see through the clothing material is good. i really love the clothing and im looking forward to buying more  also order a size bigger im a large but i bought an xlarge and it was a perfecttt fit. i love my pants fits perfectly! i\\'m delighted with this purchase, i like the style , the material is soft and lightweight,  it\\'s wearable for anytime of the day and it was a reasonable price great pants; returned for a medium, though.  smaller than expected. length was perfect, but too small/tight.  i am 5\\'7&#34;, 125 pounds and they were simply too tight.  can\\'t wait to try the medium! the fit and style are great! they fit perfect!!! i\\'m usually a size medium but sometimes depending where i go i have to go up or down. everyone said they fit pretty close to size so i took a chance! i\\'m soooooo happy i got thse! they are so cute and comfy! the design is very nice too! looooove these pants! very comfortable and good looking, don\\'t slide down .can dance in them. you may want to buy a size smaller then normal as they are not at all too tight at the top like many leggings. absolutly love! absolutly love the fit, the style the comfort everything i wanted and more love these! fit as expected. i\\'m 5\\'5 170 and the large fit great. was pleasantly surprised because i have a little chunk but they are actually slimming i\\'m 5\\'11&#34; and was so happy to find these pants were plenty long enough to wear with heels! it\\'s very hard for me to find pants long enough. if they are too long, you can just cut them off. they don\\'t seem to curl at the hem, which is nice. they do run just a tiny bit on the large side but they still fit and i would much rather have them be too large than be too small with this material. i got the black ones in xl and wonder if the large size would be too small. i might come back and try the large size. i am very happy with them and will wear these pants a lot! very comfortable. so glad! i am an obese woman, and was concerned about sizing. it fit! the colors are just as vibrant as the pik. i\\'m not an easily pleased person, but these pants are great. fyi:i ordered them because i have a cast on my leg. the pants are long enough and wide enough to wear a cast on one foot, and a boot on the other.<br />super comfy after 1st wash!!!! these are great and are exactly what i was hoping for. the colors are bright and they fit as described. cute color for summer, the pants did stretch easy so i could have gotten one size smaller. good waist and hip room. pretty much what i expected for the price. i will probably buy more in the future. good for around the house. they really collect the dog hair though. i love these pants.  the ad states they are rayon; however, mine came in and said they were 100 percent cotton.  this is ok.  my daughter has the cotton ones.  i like them both equally well.<br /><br />gigi comfy and winkle free! bit.<br />roke my kneecap and have to wear a brave. these are perfect to wear over 2luv has made me fall in love with palazzo pants. i bought a ton in different colors. perfect to wear in the office, not as restricting as suit pants, but still comfy enough to wear out or even lounging at home! i like the way they feel & look thanx the pants fit great.  but the waist line seems like it was designed for someone with a much smaller waist.  the fortunate thing is the waist is elastic. the leggings were a little small, but still fit fine. i had gotten a pair to start that had a flaw and contacted the seller, they were very quick to respond and we were able to communicate what should be done. i was sent a new pair and they are great! thanks! the sizing was a little off, i measured my waist and it is snug, not sure if i can keep.....i really like them and for $13.99 you cannot beat the price! :) i normally wear a large and i order ex-large thinking it would fit. it did not.  the pants was exactly what i order the was beautiful but did not fit. this is my favorite scrub pant. it\\'s all i wear! they do run on the short side so i have to buy tall. i usually wear a large in pants that are sized that way but have to buy a medium in these. maybe it\\'s a scrub thing because i wear medium in all scrubs. but if you are right on that line for length then go with the tall. i\\'m 5\\'7&#34; so not super tall but have to get these in tall or feel like i\\'m waiting for a flood. i love all the pockets.  i didn\\'t realize the pants ride low but i always wear a smock with it so it\\'s okay.  very comfortable. the cell pocket is the best! the pants are nice and exactly as descibed. it fitted me perfectly (ir probably wont if you\\'re big). perfect kinda thinner than expected but you geg what u pay for i love the pants! i wear them to work most days out of the work week because they are comfortable. i love how it looks slimming on me and lenghty. it looks great with low heel or dress shoes(since that\\'s what i wear wit the pants). they are perfectly fitted and definitly meet my expecations. since i weight about 123 lbs and is 5\\'7 i order a medium, since that\\'s the size i usually wear in pants( in jeans i\\'m a size 3). overall, great pants! they have not dissapointed me one bit, or at least not yet. i\\'ll see how it goes when i give it it\\'s first wash. thank you! nice comfy cotton pants, perfect for lounging around house and sleeping. a little on the large side, especially toward the bottom/knee area. nothing that affects comfort though. love these, very fast shipping, only the pants are extremely big. excellent i love these so much i bought another pair in black! great length and feel. color is gorgeous. these pants are sized perfectly. super soft fabric and comfy. perfect for casual with flats or dressy with heels. this is about the 5th pair i\\'ve ordered, so obviously i like them. they fit exactly. i feel so good in them. no static. extra long was exactly what i wanted. i love them. can\\'t say anything but &#34;try them and you will be happy.&#34; i wasn\\'t sure i\\'d like the flair at the bottom but i love it as well. love the material, a little smaller than a large is suppose to be and came with out a hem in the pants... otherwise love them... they look great and i\\'m loosing weight so they will work out fine... super cute! it is amazing! i just received the legging pants in mail and i love it so much. love the texture, fit well and feel good on, i bought burgundy i loved that color so much. i purchased these legging pants for work and daily and its just perfect for everything!!!! and great with any shirts. just know that you should definitely order one- two sizes larger than you normally would! delivered quickly (came a week before due date). i would highly recommend this legging pants. would order again for sure! i\\'m very pleased with this purchase. ;) product seems well made. i haven\\'t tried it in the ocean yet. nice corgo pant, finally found it on amazon.<br />the pant is good, fitting is very good. nice pant for reasonable price. the only reason i give this 4 stars and not 5 is because it\\'s almost a neon yellow... not quite the green shown here. but, if you want bright neon, this is it. very cute lggings. i will buy more. im so happy with this leggings. they fit as expected. i im  5.3....and. 160 .... they fit so sexy i love these pants.  so comfortable. fit fine good color why must this be 20 words? i told you i liked them and the fit fine this is a great pair of pants for the price.  very soft material, fit well and the length was perfect.  i wash and dry all of my clothes and i was very pleased that they did not shrink.  overall, this was a great purchase and i will probably buy more. i believe these are men\\'s sizing. a little loose fitting on me, a woman.  the pad is really wide between the legs too.  it\\'s uncomfortable to walk around in them, but once you\\'re on the bike, they provide nice cushion. i think men would benefit from these more than women. good price, shipping took about 3 weeks to usa. my daughter loves these! super great! these are soft, well fitting and look really snazzay! everything about the product is as described. i am very happy with the way the pants fit. love these! they are like a second skin; perfect for running errands, lounging and exercising all while staying cool and dry. for reference, i am 5\\'4&#34; 120 lbs and purchased an xs.  these are not sheer and do not become loose/ill-fitting after hours of wear. they came in a bit smaller than expected but still fit great. i don\\'t recommend drying them as it makes them kind of scratchy but beyond that they are great! love the fit. these pants are very figure flattering. i always buy jones of n.y. &#34;lexington&#34; jeans. i have also bought the dark navy wash jeans<br />that have the same wonderful fit as these black jeans. quite comfy and very reasonable price. as other reviews stated, they are a thinner material but it just makes it easier for moving in. i\\'m very satisfied. at 5\\' 4&#34; the large size is a tad long for me, but i\\'ve come to accept that with most pants. better long than short! very beautiful it\\'s a little sheer, partially transparent to my b-hind, but they\\'re comfortable and can stretch. not bad. really nice fitting legging.  the waistband is super comfortable and flattering. very happy with this purchase! i didn\\'t expect much for the price, but they are great! finally!!!  straight leg cargo pants that fit!  i\\'m tall and slender so a u.s. size 4 fits me perfectly. i\\'m 5\\'7&#34; and the length is a little long but i prefer my pants on the longer rather than the shorter side. they go well with clunky black boots, birkenstocks or hiking boots. i ordered the khaki & the camouflage.  next i\\'m going to order the brown. very pretty material. will order xl next time. i love the fit, however the material picks up every piece of lint within a mile radius!!!  since they are black, i have to use a sticky roller about 4 times/day. i just received these leggings and they look great! the cat print is fun.<br />the material feels awesome and they fit perfectly. i\\'m glad i ordered them. they are a tiny bit thin- but not too much, and not see through on me. but they are a little loose around the waist. other than that they fit well.  i ordered the small, and i am about 5\\'3&#34; and about 105 lbs. i love it. the material is very nice. my recipient of these pants loved them and says they are sooo comfortable.  my only negative comment is that i had to return the 1st pant that i ordered as a medium looked way too small.  my recipient is about a size 8.  then i ordered a large.  i ended up keeping those for my daughter who is a size 2-4 in ladies.  so i ended up getting an extra large to make sure they would be comfortable and not too tight. that was  perfect.  so what would a bigger women do???? as described, fast shipping. very nice pants & they are true to size, & very soft & comfortable. im really happy with this purchase ! i will by from them again ! thank you ! these pants are great to wear from yoga practice. they are a little long on me and drag the ground, but i am short at 5\\'2&#34; so i expect everything to be a little long. enjoy! a little snug at the hip.  beautiful, wrinkle free.  wish i were taller to keep from having to hem them 3&#34;! if you order the wrong size or it doesn\\'t fit right, they have great customer service and are very helpful! i ordered these in black and the material is a lot thicker than i thought it would be. still flowy and not heavy but definitely not see-through.  inseam is right at 31 inches.they run a little large. the large definitely fits like an xl. if i wanted them a little more fitted in the hip/booty/thigh area i\\'d order a medium. there\\'s so much stretch that even if you order way too small they\\'re still going to fit but may be a little sheerer. overall, really nice. the material is soft and drapey and the fit thru the hips and thighs is flattering, but they are about 7 inches too long....i am 5\\'6&#34; ... so these would easily fit a tall girl in....heels.  i am going to have to pay someone to hem them because i don\\'t have a double needle attachment on my machine. great product very comfortable, material is not what i expected it to be but is very forgiving. i\\'ve actually ordered a second pair already! length was also a little short. i am 5\\'6 but i just washed them and stretched them out a little and they were good these are my new favorite pants. i just ordered another pair in a different color and pattern. super sexy! only one with these in my area fits comfortably.  danced all night.  im 5\\'1&#34; and 155lbs.. normally wear 10-12 size pants.  large is great.  too long for me.. cut off about 4 inches and they are perfect in low heels.  havent needed to hem.. rolled up and surviving washes no problem.<br /><br />fabric is thin, but no more then expected for type of pants.. both black and red are not see through.  great flow to the fabric.  shows off shape for the waist and upper thighs.. then falls to wide legs. fit is great but the material is slighter thinner than i expected.  good for spring and fall with sneakers but i do not recommend for cold winter days. excellent material and great fit bought for my 85-year-old aunt in a nursing home and they\\'re perfect for her. love them, fit kinda big really great pants. so soft i want to live in them. kind of run small so be careful when ordering. waist size was spot on, yet the length of the pants were short. super cute nice color & quality for very reasonable price. i actually measured myself to determine the size & the 37w has a tag inside that says size 14 and it fits like a 14. i love all the pockets. great value for this price. only improvement would be a draw string. these are now my favorite leggings ever~ it came a lot earlier than expected- a whole 9 days i think. i was surprised (happily) to find that they were topshop shorts, which was not mentioned in the description.<br />unfortunately, they were smaller than expected, but i could still squeeze into them. my fault for not ordering the size up, but it would have been nice to have a specific size chart for this item.<br />what really got me is that when taking them off for the first time to go to the bathroom after wearing them for only ~5 hours (not long!), the zipper came off its track. this was really annoying, but i could probably fix it. then, when fixing that, the zipper pull (not the thing on the track but the thing you pull on) snapped in half! i\\'m rather annoyed that this happened after only wearing them once. i put a doubled up piece of embroidery thread through the zipper so i can still wear them, but the company should really fix the zipper.<br />all in all though i did like the product. it\\'s a really cute design, a bit more faded than it seems in the picture, but still really nice. if i had bought the right size it would have fit better, but it still fit pretty well. the item is ok,came on time,material is nice,but the sizes are biger than what it should.love the fabric,keep up the good job. very comfortable & fit perfectly. great fitment, , seams good quality these are great pants and i think that i have about 4 pairs, but just as one reviewer said the zipper does get stuck at times.  but, for the value and the ease in care...they are still a great pair of pants to have in your wardrobe.  plus, of my 4 pairs, only 1 has a zipper problem!  :) just love these pants!! fit as expected very comfortable for my work out. these look fantastic with informal tops. they\\'re super cute and comfortable, hands down. it works for both workout and every day kind of clothing. highly recommended. we gave this to our daughter for a gift and she loves them, she wears them all the time. they are temp adjusting, warm enough for winter but not hot in the summer. great yoga pants. i fell in love with these pants the first time i wore them particularly this style #, i was having a hard time finding this style till i checked amazon they carry all colors !! will be buying more in the future. very comfortable and wash well ,true to size. very flattering to my figure. 5\\'8 139lbs. a little stretchy in the legs but still great material and look. i\\'m purchasing the black ones, now.  wondering if i should try a small because of the slight stretchiness in the leg department. i\\'ve had that problem with other leggings i purchased, though.  maybe it\\'s \\'cause from my ankle to knee is somewhat on the slender side. really like the way these feel on.  very happy with this purchase.    ok, editing my review-  today is the 3rd time i\\'ve worn them. as i mentioned in previous review, they\\'re a little stretchy and sag a bit in the back. so, i reach behind to pull them slightly and they ripped. there\\'s an oval shape whole right above the butt.    this happened when i was at the grocery store.   thank god i am wearing a long enough top, lol!  i will sew them, now.    i purchased the black in small. we\\'ll see how that goes😉 super cute! these are great, comfortable and so affordable - i work from home so can\\'t get enough of this type of thing! cute pants and very comfy, good material. seems just a tad small. very nice pants. they fit nicely and comfortable . great value for the price, amazing fit, lovely color i love the way they fit! they don\\'t get baggy. the length is right on, and the color wash is just right. great fit and great for lounging around the house on a nasty winter day, which is what we have had all winter. these are the most comfortable yoga pants that i own i can\\'t wait to buy more. perfect! bought as a present and my friend loves them. i took a chance ordering these pants for my daughter who is about 5\\'7 and plus size. its always hard finding pants that are long enough and still stylish without having to buy a bigger size which means they end up being to big and still not long enough. she wanted skinny jeans, we tried all kinds of pants that claim to be skinny and long but ended up not. these jeans are a god send, not only are they long but also skinny at the ankles as well as very comfortable because they stretch so it makes them form fitting which makes her look so slim. they do run a size big. she was so happy with these pants that i ordered her every color they had and if they come out with more colors i will be ordering those to. i recommend these pants for any woman or girl that\\'s tall and wants to look stylish and yet still comfortable. i love these cargo pants. they fit perfectly as advertised and are great for carrying any type of hiking/camping gear with me. the pockets are heavy duty and can handle a great amount of weight in them. i\\'ll keep these for as long as they fit me! really nice fit! these are as expected, and i enjoy wearing them! they are a bit short, but i read reviews and expected that.  for what i paid, i love them.  they are super soft and comfortable. great piece. thanks got 2 pair of scrubs. i just wished it had more pockets. first of all, heres some stats about my body type so hopefully it will help some women with judging whether or not these pants would work for them:<br />5\\'2, 150lbs, most of my weight carried in hips and thighs, so i bought a m to make sure it would be a comfortable fit for my back end. it runs on the small side but it is ok anyway for me the pants are just sharp looking classy and timeless. i hope style & co makes them an all colors; the only advise is get a size larger if you do not like tightness around the hips. beautiful pants...get it! it fits nicely comfy and nice would like to b a little thicker to bein style womens long sleeve thermal set under wear fit pertect and all you have to do is wash these in cold water and these keep you warm for winter when the weather gets cold and when you wear these underwear they will keep you warm on cold days  and when i bought these on line i tried them on and they fit good so anyway thank you for sending these to me ontime a little small , but none the less comfortable. i really like these!! perfect!  feel great , cute fabric! no weird smell , which has been an issue with other brands. just found my new favorite brand! i\\'m 5\\'4 & 140 lbs & they fit perfectly. also arrived within half the time they were supposed to i really like the fit and looks of these pants. i really like these and i am definitely keeping them. the fit is a little off for my larger rear and thighs. it fits tight around my thighs and loose around my waist. as a result they slide down fairly often. i can\\'t use them for higher intensity workouts like running or kickboxing but for lifting and walking they are great! length is very long. the fabric is somewhat see through so i have to wear shorts over it (which was my intention anyways) but was hoping that maybe they\\'d double as grappling leggings for my brazilain jiu-jitsu class i love these pants! comfortable and beautiful! i love these, i ordered a small and they fit perfect and super comfy!!! i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; the length is also perfect. should have bought two or three pairs love!!!!!!! i\\'m really inpressed with my champion pants and have such a quick deliverly. they are so comfortable and very warm. just perfect. correct sizing.  great fit.  thank you just as the other reviewer noted - the vendor clearly stated to order by the size chart.  unlike the other reviewer, when i did i ended up with pants that are just a little too tight.  i ordered the 2xl and the length was correct but the waist was slightly small. the waist on mine are 73cm (28in = m in the usa) which is an xl on their chart.<br /><br />aside from the sizing problem, the pants were very well made.  the material is great quality and the stitching was great as well. if there were made a little larger and would fit a l in us sizing i would definitely order more.  i am considering contacting the company to see if i can get these made larger.  they are exactly what i wanted – just not the correct size.  for a smaller person, they would be perfect. these slacks look very nice. i need to lose a few pounds, and if i do, with the elastic waist, i think they will still look very good. i ordered the 3x and  opened them and wow so cute better than expected and pretty long inseam and pretty high waisted but saddly on further inspection there was a small hole in the bum so i returned them and had to order a size smaller because thats all they had left so i really hope they fit but being cottony sweatpants i bet they streach but i liked them so much ill make them work :-) good quality! these are very nice sweat pants. they are a bit long on my 5\\'5&#34; frame, but otherwise fairly true to size. very long and comfortable i love them amazing pants. i just used it for my winter vacation in smoky mountains. incredible feel of comfort. not bulky, very soft, worm and waterproof. i could never compare with all those bulky snow pants. and the style extremely cute. definiteley buy again. im us size small and thats what i ordered, was perfect. seller is incredible helpful, will answer every question.  also if you really not sure about the size i suggest contact seller , as the seller helps you a lot in choosing the right size. i never mes such an excellent seller . incredible attention to buyer and great communication. just please know that it ships from china so prepare to be patient, but you will be happy for the ordered item. works well and is comfortable i bought 2 for my mom, and she was very happy! 5 stars!!! fits like a glove i love these pants are perfect in color and size.  a little too long as i am short, but i am a good hemmer.  v. lepell these are nice and perfect for a breeze summer day. i love them but have to get them altered in the waste because they are a little long. very soft. good price. i\\'m a shorty zaftig, so i\\'m used to pants being a little long. they\\'d have been perfect in a &#34;petite&#34; choice. my wife loves them. they are very soft on the body and feels great. very comfortable to wear around the house when you are in a lounging mood. fits as expected....bought this for my mom and she loved it....very comfortable they fit nicely, very comfortable. stretches with you. if you eat a little much, it stretches for you. lol! i like the dark color. it\\'s great! the fabric feels great, it has a great fit and the price and service were amazing !!! i highly recommend it great product... it makes you sweat. i wear it when i run & do workouts. just wash before wearing it has a chemical smell. amazing.  first: these pants arrived two days after i ordered them, from india.  the material and designs are beautiful and high quality.  yes, the pants could be tricky to tie at first -- these are wrap pants, just like wrap skirts.  however, it\\'s not that hard, and if i can figure out an articulate way to explain it,  will update my review. i feel sexy when i put them on, also a nice combo with knee hi boots. the product description lies. this is 55% linen and 45% viscose. minus 2 stars for blatantly misleading customers.<br /><br />other than that. i ordered s in coral. i am 5\\'5\\\\\\\\\" 125 lbs with a 26 in waist and 34 hips. they fit perfectly in terms of width (loose relaxed hip but still hip/bum skimming). length they are about 2.5 inches too long. i have a 30\\\\\\\\\" inseam (yup, i have short legs) so i expect them to be too long. it\\'s a simple fix you can do yourself.  the color is bright. like summer neon coral nailpolish bright. because i bought these for a summer vacation it\\'s fine, but i was expecting something a little more pastel, like the photo. material: a little itchy, not annoyingly so, but you can feel it. i think it\\'ll get less with wear/wash. overall, the pants are fine for the price, i was just very disappointed by the misleading product description.<br /><br />update!<br /><br />wore these pants through a month long backpacking trip through southeast asia. i added a drawstring into the double-thick elastic foldover and these pants withstood heavy mistreatment handsomely. i handwashed them 4-5 times and dragged them through 2 monsoons and they dried quickly (4 hours, hand wrung)and dirt stains came out easily. the scratchiness went away after a few wears and washes. great airplane pants. +one star back for durability and comfort despite the misleading description. nice love not too small that they dont fit, just not the same loose way i like to wear my clothes. amazingly soft  jogger pant with a two front pockets .breathable fabric with  60% cotton and 40% polyster . finished with a dropped inseam and a gathered elastic cuff. very comfortable, soft drawstring tie waistband and adjustable. perfect fit!  there are so many color options to choose from and the cost is very affordable. the color coral is nice and perfect for  me.  i\\'d read that they were cut a little small, so i\\'m glad i ordered a size up for my first pair, as they\\'re more loungy. though initially a little snug in the thigh, after an hour of so of wear they loosened up a lot. for my next pair i\\'ll order my true size to wear for yoga and running and hopefully they won\\'t be quite so baggy when they &#34;warm up. really good!!! it came on time and the pants are  comfortable and really good quality...the material isn\\'t thin and i will be ordering this in different colors if they r available....i would rerecommend these to friends and family!!!&#34; i was provided with this item at a discount price to test and exchange my review for honest evaluation. if you have any questions, feel free to comment below or contact me in my profile. excelent had to shorten but that is usual like the color a lot. have had the black pant for over a year these are very unique and cute, they fit just right! i love these! i\\'m a size 18 and these fit me very well. i like the all fabric patterns they sent me, which was very lucky,  because some sari silk patterns are not attractive. on one pair of pants the fabric seems like they cut one leg higher up on the textile than the other leg. on the waist area, the patterns don\\'t match up. this might be considered a factory second, i really don\\'t know.<br /><br />i wear them for pajama pants and around the house. the silk blend feels very nice against my skin.  its not the super slippery silk you might expect, but it feels very nice to wear. i am sensitive to some fabrics, and i really love this. i love them so soft i will be ordering more. great product, fast delivery ! this are the best pair of pants i\\'ve ever had!<br />they fit perfect! and they do no shrink at all when i washed them i am so happy! very comfortable i was really nervous about ordering pants without trying them on. when i put them on i was so pleased with the way they looked and fit. i am 5 ft 4 in. the pants came right below my ankles. great fit for me. i ordered more as soon as i received them. true to size and quit sexy. iwhen you walk in the room all eyes are on you. great fit and the fabric let you move freely. i really love pants that can either be dressed up or down.  i can totally wear a blouse and nice shoes with these to work or flip flops and a t-shirt for everyday.  they fit well and are a good comfortable quality. i love them. they arrived earlier this week and they fit as expected. the will work very well for the show that i am going to wear them in. this is the second pair i bought my gf and she loves them just like the first pair. she said they are thin, thinner than the vs secret ones. i ordered these over a year ago, and they have held up, washed well, and remained comfortable. i bought it for my mother. she looks 10 years younger. i loved it. i wore these for the super bowl and was getting saluted all night ! haha loveee these. very comfy and looks exactly as described. was kind of scared to wash but just do it inside out and hang dry, or take to the cleaners. they are fine -  as described and satisfactory yoga comfy pants -  price is very good. i read a lot of reviews but order these anyway. i am a curvy woman, and wear a 12-14. the extra-large fit just fine for me, the fabric is thin, so i won\\'t be wearing these until the weather is warmer. the only thing is that the back ground color was black and i originally ordered it in a brown which i thought looked cooler with the wonderful, colorful pattern. love i love these! they fit great. i ordered a small and wear between a 4 and 6 in jeans. they were a little long when i first tried them on but after washing they were perfect! i am 5\\'5&#34;. i like that you can choose how much you want to fold over, so if you are feeling a little bloated you can cover your tummy ;) i am glad i ordered 2 pairs, i will probably order more! they are slightly longer but nothing that i can\\'t fix...love the color. arrived on time. fit this plus sized lady perfectly! no digging in at the waist but was still supportive enough to stay up on their own. colors look fantastic and are very flattering and fun to wear! i can\\'t recommend these enough and i wish there were more styles in xl plus for me to buy! i bought these for halloween and they worked great. i\\'m 5\\'9&#34; and wear a 3/4 and i thought the fit was like any other leggings i would buy, they are snug but not too tight plus i loved how they are actually long enough for me. in regards to how some people said they are gray it\\'s from the fabric stretching (it\\'s not super thick material) so by my ankles they are black but on my thighs they turn grayish. overall it\\'s the quality you\\'d expect for the price. i\\'m about 185 lbs, size 16, with thick thighs and a big booty. i ordered the xxl and it fit just fine. it wasn\\'t too tight around my thighs, and the padding was in the right places. hope this was helpful. very comfortable and love the color and patterns.  hate to change out of them on the weekend.  two pair purchase a great value! just perfect. i normally wear a large but ordered a medium and they are exactly what i wanted.<br />definitely recommend them. i dont write reviews but these were perfect! i\\'m small-medium and they fit like a glove and the fabric is unbelievably soft. i would def recommend it. i have a small waist and big thighs - these pants gave me a fashion forward, super flattering basic. the denim has some stretch - always welcome. looooove wearing these with mid calf boots or strappy platform sandals. xoxo! (i bought them in black as well) a little longer than expected, but that is workable. they fit well in all other areas! the quality was better than i expected love them, they are so pretty and comfortable. the material is very light and soft. these scrub pants are perfect for short people. i am 5\\'1&#34;, and most scrub pants trail behind me. not with these! i am a massage therapist, and sometimes i work barefoot. i don\\'t even step on the hem! i like that they are cotton too. i really wish more companies would make petite pants, but until then i\\'m going to just keep buying koi. i absolutely love these leggings😍 they\\'re perfect and all my friends love them i will be buy another pair 💞 i\\'m not a belly dancer. i wore these to a lindy hop dance and two ballroom dances within two days of receiving them (two in one night, then washed them and wore them again the next night).<br /><br />they were a hit, and at no time did i feel any more inhibited in my movement than i would be dancing in yoga pants.<br /><br />they do run small, i was barely able to squeeze into them, 5\\'3&#34; 145 lbs, and they are just a tad long on me so if you\\'re over 5\\'5\\' they\\'d probably be too short. love how it look and fast delivery highly recommend it. i really love these pants, but they are a bit snug for a 16.  the side zip is ideal.  beautiful lines and no need to hem the petite. its not as loose as others in the middle though. just what i expected! i think they changed their sizing system so that the us sizes are actually us sizes. so don\\'t listen to the reviews below and actually get your size. i\\'m usually 5-6, bought an 8 by recommendation of the reviewers below, and it was definitely one size too large.<br /><br />otherwise, the quality and cut is great, i ordered another in my size, hope it gets here soon! exactly what i wanted just a little snug around the mid-section creating a &#34;muffin top&#34; because it sits below the waist.  fortunately, an over blouse will take care of that.  overall, i like the jeans..nice vibrant color, quality material, fast delivery and most importantly a nice price. will purchase more and now that i know where the waist fits will just go up a size larger. very nice, good buy and love it. the fit is good... i like them a little big...very comfortable n nice looking..dress up or down...will definitely continue to buy them...!! these pants are very soft, comfortable and great quality for the cost. i have worn them walking my dogs,working out at the gym, and just lounging in my apartment. they also fit as expected for me! great pants!  comfortable for lounging and great for work with the right shirt : ) nice pants, run a little small my girlfriend likes these a lot run very small. i am 5\\'2 and about 120 and i am very tight in the smalls. def should of got a med but i will make it due! needed them for an event and they worked amazing! wearing these right now! they are perfect and i love them! :d i bought this for my aging mother to prevent leakage from diapers.<br />works as described. very happy with the purchase.<br />would recommend.<br />anna b love them these pants are amazing!!!  the color is super rich and they are incredibly smooth.  lots of compliments!  they are a little tighter than i had expected, but that\\'s not necessarily a bad thing, since they don\\'t bunch up or slip down! these are nice pajama bottoms, not as soft as i thought they would be, but they are still comfortable. i love it, very good... :) i choose it because i liked it and i could see it in the photo and was very good described super happy! super comfortable! i did find out they are a bit see through when you bend over..but i still wear them all the time, just a little more carefully! i bought these in the large and extra large as they are advertised as junior sizes.  if your an adult extra small or small...you need to order the large or extra large and they will fit like the adult sizes. great length and overall style. i like the fact that this brand is not your typical over sized scrubs. i do wish this style was a little more fitted around the waist fit as expected. top waistband a bit loose though. these do look exactly as they are pictured. extremely comfortable. the fabric is beautiful and soft. it\\'s rayon, but doesn\\'t seem to wrinkle like a lot of rayon does. ? i\\'m sure it will wrinkle some. i got the brown and the colors are beautiful, and the fabric almost has a shimmer to it.  it looks see-through when you hold them up to the light, but looks completely opaque when they\\'re on.  i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; and probably 135-40 lbs? i recently went from a size 2 to a size 4-6, so had to buy some new clothes! the smocked/elastic waistband is a little snug, but not uncomfortable or too tight.  if you are taller than 5\\'5&#34;, i think these might be a little short.  they look on me about exactly as they do on the model in the picture next to my review.  for the price, i may buy another pair or two in different colors.  they\\'re definitely cheaper than omgirl, or some similar brand, for yoga pants, and every bit as functional.  i am wearing them today at my office job (though my office is relatively casual). my office manager told me right away how pretty they are.  they can definitely be dressed up for dates or work (depending on your work) with the right top / jewelry / scarf, etc. i gave them 4 stars instead of 5 just because the cut/construction is a little unflattering - but they\\'re not really made to be flattering, either.  they\\'re cute, fun, pretty. i like pants/skirts that are lower-waisted, but these are what they are. best pants i\\'ve ever owned! super comfy and colorful. but at 5\\'1&#34; they are way too long. to be fair this is an ongoing issue for me, but these seem to be much longer in the leg than the other pants i have had this issue with. love but shrinks in the dryer. . wish a little longer after reading about the sizing i ordered extra large and they fit as expected. they provide a soft cushion for a comfortable ride. because they came from an overseas seller it took about 4 weeks to get them. very comfortable pants. i am just about 5\\'10&#34;. if you are close to that, the pants won\\'t be long. much shorter, i suggest you pass. the material is on the thin side, but that was what i was looking for. something comfortable and lightweight for summer evenings. even being thin, i had no issues with being see through.<br /><br />i only gave these a 4 star because there was a small puncture hole by the main cross seam at the waist.  what it appeared to be was a puncture from the sewing needle. i have of course sewn it closed.<br /><br />fits as expected, with almost floor length.  i wear a 22 normally and the 3x was perfect. love them, love them, love them!!! i am 5\\'3&#34; and 125 lbs. these fit me, but just a tad on the small side (though better than i could have hoped for from a one size its all product). somewhat see through if you\\'re wearing a highly contrasting color underneath. the design is a little blurry only if you look really closely. very slick material, very shiny. love the look and the price. great fit, lovely shade of white for summer outings, good quality.  can dress these pants up or down..  would recommend highly. bought these twice each time two pair large black. they were exactly as i expected both times. i love them and will probably order more in the future. love these jeans!!!! these fit perfectly! i love them! will be getting more colors love these! so nice, and relaxing very nice fabric easy to put on and very fashionable purchased by a man for his wife who looked very sexy in the pants with a cool tea shirt very comfortable. a bit thinner then i normally like and more nylon then i normaily buy. i prefer more cotton feel. but i like the look. very cute and got several compliments. my husband purchased me a nice pajama set for christmas.  i always get xl in pajamas to make sure they are loose and plenty of room to lounge.<br />at first, the seller made an error and sent a large.  when we received the xl they were very tight and went below the stomach.  this seller gave no refunds but kept sending me larger and larger sizes.  i went on the website and noticed that a lot of pajamas now had pajama bottoms with no elastic and they started below you stomach(or belly).<br />i kept the top which fit fine.  i finally found this beautiful pair of pajama sleepwear which is confortable and goes great with my top, plain black (goes with a lot) and fits great! pants are cool:) i didn\\'t realize these pants were basically jeggings, and that\\'s good, because i probably wouldn\\'t have ordered them if i had, and i would have missed out on something very comfortable!  they do run a little bit big...maybe half a size.<br /><br />i matched them with this shirt and i swear, i feel like i\\'m out and about in my pajamas!<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b0085r3bag/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i02?ie=utf8&psc=1 i love it at first i was debating on sizing up due to some of the previous reviews, but i decided to go ahead and order a small anyway. they fit perfectly. the color is very vibrant (i bought the mint green ones). i do have two complaints though:<br />1. they\\'re pretty thin (not not like see through thin or anything), so you can see the outline of the front pockets. if you mess with them for a few minutes they end up looking okay though.<br />2. there was a bunch of extra fabric in the back right pocket that they must have forgotten to cut out. i cut it out myself.<br /><br />for the price, these are amazing. perfect for a halloween costume, but waste size doesn\\'t match leg size. bought as gift. she loves them. the only thing i would have changed is not getting a couple of sizes up... i am normally a 28-30, but some of the reviews stated that they ran kind of small, so i decided to play it safe and got the next size up...<br /><br />taking them out of the package was wonderful! nicely packed and so soft! i love them, even though they are a bit big on me. i am going to order more! its really good, but.. well, if you have chubby legs don\\' t try it xd im skinny and the cuts in the pants were kinda pressing on my skin a little when i bent my knees, but other then that, and the missing button hole its a really good pair of pants. i like them a lot love, love, love these shorts, a little to tight at the top but other wise. amazing too small, but nice scrubs i belly dance so these are perfect for both practices and also performances.  a little tight on the elastic in the waist but otherwise ery cute and well made. nicely made.  i like them. i love these pants. they are cool, not tight fitting, wash up beautifully, though they run long but will with a few runs through a hot dryer, shrink up about 3 inches. i have them in black and denim and as they have only side pockets they can be worn for slightly dressier occasions. a great universal pant. sometimes you want that used worn jean look that seems to go so well with that slubby shirt and make you look chic.  this is that pair of jeans.  i got the 10, but the size appeared to run a bit small for me for the look i wanted.  if you see the picture it is a bit loose and not completely fitted, and i think you would need to be a small 10 or an 8 for that.  otherwise i like the look, and as i\\'ve been losing weight, these have simply been placed aside for the time. soft and comfortable cotton pants, great design, and stay the same after several washes! definitely my favorite pair of pants right now and can go with so many different outfits! i wear a size 14/16 and stand about 5 ft 8 inches tall.  the xl size fit well and is long enough for me.  i found them very comfortable because of the stretchy fabric.  the fabric is also very soft, which i also like.  for me, i feel the material is a little too thin to wear outside the house.  however, i did purchase them with the intent to just wear them for lounging around and for me they work well for that purpose.  with the added 9.84 shipping charge i found total cost a little expensive.  i have not washed them yet so i don\\'t know how they will hold up or if they shrink. wonderful!  i love the way the top is made it comes up to mid waist so i am comfortable in thes knowing my butt is not going to show. finally, something online that fits! everything i was looking for! i used to buy express yoga pants but they no longer sell them, so i\\'m pleased how similar these compare. the material is slightly cheaper, but just as stretchy and comfortable.  good size and length for relatively long legs (i\\'m 5\\'10&#34;). perfect for a growing pregnant belly. i received these leggings a lot faster than the anticipated ship date which was a plus!  they came and were exactly what i wanted! the price was perfect and these leggins are adorable.  just be aware that the leggings are a little thinner than actual &#34;sweater&#34; leggings - they are more like thick &#34;tights&#34;.  so, if you are looking for warmth, these don\\'t offer much warmth, but are still ok to wear during winter with a sweater tunic. everything i wanted. price is just right and i shared with all my co-workers!!!! these pants are very nice and well made for the price. to be honest, i was expecting a less generous cut and a lighter weight fabric when i selected the size. these pants are not staying up. i am afraid to wear them in public because they are so much not staying up. a drawstring in the waist would have improved things immensely here. i am not returning them because somehow when i return things i always end up losing money on it, so i am going to try washing them and drying with the dryer on high. though honestly it does not seem like the type of thing that will shrink in the wash. i mean it as a compliment, really. i just didn\\'t quite understand what i was getting for my twenty bucks and ordered too large. i think i was expecting more of a pair of soft, comfy, not too well made pajama bottoms, probably with a drawstring waist. these lounge pants are a little higher on the food chain than that, i guess. i would recommend ordering 1x if you normally think you need 2x in a garment like this. i liked the color, heather navy, too, by the way. honestly, a drawstring would have solved so much here. i love these skinnies. they\\'re true to size and color. i really love my yoga pants, i am 5\\'8\\' and it has always been really difficult for me to find (yoga) pants long enough to fit my shape with a controlled top and that i like .....these yoga pants are perfect for me, they are not as thick as i would like but that\\\\\\\\\"s fine i am just thankful i found them... i love the pants but they are too big for me...i will reorder in a smaller size..the pants looked very nice i bought the large size, being 8 1/2 month pregnant. i\\'m 5\\'3&#34; and was 130 lbs pre-pregnancy, and let\\'s just say i\\'ve gained all the expected pregnancy weight plus a few more pounds. these fit just fine. i had to hem about 4&#34; off the bottom, but for the cost, it was worth it. they seem to be thick enough to not show everything underneath. i would buy again. i bought mine too big, still keeping them because i still wore them.  they look great but are lose buy a size you think would be tight and you will still be comfy and your but will look legit.  i bought black, blue and green.  meant them to be for work but i wear them out. she said she loves the color and the fit. also made a comment about the penguin being cute. the material is very soft and the product is made very well. she is quite happy with these. love the pants!!! super cute!! just a tiny bit on the long side, but other than that they are perfect! i decided to buy these in spite of the sizing issues people had in other reviews. i am 5\\'5&#34; 190-ish pounds and bottom heavy (butt and thighs). i bought a large and i put these on, they were very snug which i expected because they are &#34;slimming&#34; which means they\\'re supposed to hold you in. had i gotten an x-large (which isn\\'t available) i wouldn\\'t have gotten the same slimming effect. i am mostly torso so i didn\\'t have a problem with the length of the pants but i could see where a person with longer legs would have a flooding issue. they are average length...not short or tall. the fabric is great, sturdy but soft and breathable and not opaque...although i didn\\'t try to wear bright/patterned panties with them to check if you could see them or not but i couldn\\'t see panty lines that\\'s for sure. i wore these the day after they got delivered, i love amazon because my products always arrive much sooner than expected and these were no exception. love them, would definitely buy another pair. so if you\\'re looking for something loose and flowy please go up a size because these are supposed to be snug. happy shopping! i got a large and i\\'m 5\\'2 140 pounds and it was completely a crop top. in the picture it looks loose, and  i still got a large to try and make sure it would have a looser fit. and still it was on the tighter side. i love these! they are so comfortable and really do fit perfectly around my curves! i\\'ll probably end up purchasing another one because i love them so much! kind of big, but alright. fit just like expected... very sexy and comfortable, now i can go for shopping, job or for just travel with this beauty pant, enjoy it! even more fun in person! love these!  so cozy with the fleece lining, and the suspender straps make sure they stay up on the waist even with lots of movement.  i have stayed perfectly warm in them and definitely recommend the product for any outdoor adventure. i love these pants. i love the feel and that they don\\'t pull down when you bend over. i am 5\\'10 and these are long on me but i just cuff the bottom and deal with it. the regular length shrinks a little and then feels too short, so i like the long ones. love all the colors too i didnt want to waste a ton of money on maternity clothes so i bought a pair of these to see if i liked them enough to buy more. they fit nice, they hug my hips and thighs (not to tight, just right to were theyre not falling down). there long but i like that also! ill be buying another pair or 2 in different colors!! pants are so comfortable. very itchy until you wash them. i only put them in the dryer for a bit to get the wrinkles out and then i hang dry them till dry. don\\'t want them to shrink or look worn. if i could buy 5 pairs of these i\\'d wear them all week long to work i am obsessed with these pants! they do for a little snug on my back side because i have a larger bottom than most, so they are slightly see through, but easily camofloughed so no one would be able to tell. great fabric, very light and breezy and just all around adorable. plan on ordering more in the future! fit as expected.  a belt is needed, though.  they are very sturdy. fabulous fabric and fully lined. cute as he\\'ll.<br />great right leg jean these are perfect! very happy they are long enough and look great while being super comfy! ordered another pair already and plan on ordering more. these are super comfortable. there are a lot of nice little details (pockets, embroidery), the material is really high quality and soft, and i like knowing they\\'re organic. plus, i get compliments every time i wear them. comfy, soft fabric, great fit. i\\'m 5\\'5&#34; and 125 lbs, small fit well and not too short. this is the first piece of maternity clothing i have bought sense finding out we were having a baby.. and i love the length, im 5\\'11 so these are great for me and they feel comfortable but the band on these pants keep rolling down my tummy especially when i wear a loose fitting shirt:( the band needs to be longer as to cover the entire belly.  i went up one pant size as im only 28 weeks and will definitely get bigger in the stomach region! so hopefully they will stay up within the next month, i would love to  buy them in black, brown and red...as i like the fabric!   overall love the length...like the fabric..dislike the tummy band the color is just like on the picture, it fits well, i like it! i got the &#34;multicoulored-a4,&#34; a vibrant tribal print with colors perfect for late summer & fall. i\\'m 5\\'9&#34;, 128# and these are very form-fitting as if they were xs or even xxs. good thing the fabric is soft & a bit stretchy. i also have to wear 3&#34; heels with them! i think i may cut them down a little. with all the styles offered, there are probably many manufacturers & labels so it may be trial & error for the perfect fit. i\\'m glad i got it right the 1st time because these are really pretty & flattering. i am 5\\'9&#34; and 170 lbs. and got these in a size large.  i had to re-hem them taking the length up 4.75&#34; in order to make them wearable!  otherwise they fit great and are very comfortable and flattering, though the fabric is a little scratchy but i expect this will improve with washing. they are great! just very long. these pants are made like leggings but are a lot thicker. they are super comfy and really soft to the touch. they are made with 63% viscose, 33% nylon, and 4% elastane. it has a wide elastic waistband which makes them really comfortable around your waist. these pants also help hold in your stomach. there is a seam/line going down the front and back of each leg. this helps make your legs look slimmer. there is a small slanted silver zipper pocket on the front side of each leg. they also have a tapered leg. i ordered the smallest size, 14/16. unfortunately they are too large for me. i will have to get mine altered. the waist measures about 19-1/2\\\\\\\\\" across. the leg opening is 6\\\\\\\\\". they measure 40\\\\\\\\\" from waist to bottom of pant leg and have a 30\\\\\\\\\" inseam. they are machine washable. i received this product to test in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. cloth is good but colors not as bright as seems in picture, overall i liked it. love it. very comfortable. most comfy. silky and feel great on. i like these-alot!!! i wear a size 0 and 1 in pants. and i like them to be tight, but not too tight around the waist. would these fit me correctly? i love these a pretty looking thing. highly comfortable so comfortable!! l these jammy pants are soft and warm while they also look cute. perfect for wintertime relaxing. i am 5\\'1&#34; so they are a little long but over all they fit well. i am average weight for my height. fit great!  thank you! wore them to go to yoga...exactly as described/depicted, exactly what i needed/wanted. ordered 9/24<br />eta 10/22<br />ata 10/10<br /><br />i bought these because i wanted to see how well $9 legging would compare to some of my name brand favorites... blackmilk.<br /><br />tag reads size &#34;5&#34; -  i would consider them med/lg<br />material is better than most knockoffs i have tried else where. does not go see thru when worn.<br />the bottom halves are not great and a bit flimsy. the material clearly does not have a large amount of spandex.<br /><br />overall. thumbs up. will be buying again. i immediately fell in love with these as soon as i tried it on. awesome colors,, lightweight and comfortable.  and what i loved most of all, expedient delivery!!! i wear a definite small zero, was told to go up a size, feel they will still fit after washing,haven\\'t read instructions yet, but i don\\'t put any of my clothing in dryer.fabric nice sturdy yet not heavy feeling.washed dryer pants as were to big but i\\'m sure i should have got size 0,,,,for anyone else sizing suggested would probably work i believe i\\'m only a 0:( did wash nicely. my mom loves these pant there stretchy and soft, just the pants she needs.. fit was true to size. good quality. i like the product they fit perfect except they are too long.. they are fabulous pants. they are comfortable and i get compliments when i wear them. the fabric is thin but i wear leggings or hose with them. makes my legs look better. delivery was so fast. .i couldn\\'t believe it. .the pants fit great..i\\'m 5\\'6 and 125 pounds. .i ordered a small..i will be ordering more colors seller is easy to work with and very responsive. pants are cute but run a little small. super comfy! the material is pretty sheer, but it\\'s not a big deal since these are my &#34;house pants.&#34; wouldn\\'t recommend wearing them out in bright sunlight though. great pants!!! fit perfectly!!!good material!!!very sexy!!! great service!!! i recommend to all my friends, the best pants you can buy!!! thanks. do you accept returns to swap for a larger size? i ordered a m and need a l.<br /><br />other than that they are awesome! good style, smug fit, but ok. i haven\\'t warhead the yet to see if they shrink but they are stretchy so it should be ok. good price!! not as soft as i thought they would be. these pants were as advertised and delivered when expected.  i would order them again when i need another pair or for a gift. god these are comfy and for the price its not bad at all good!! these yoga pants fit and the black lasts longer than any victoria secret yoga pants i have bought and they are half the price! the band is super big so i believe any curvy gal can enjoy them w/out worry they are going to roll up. good fit, very pleased. funky and fun -- can wear to formal and informal settings -- the only issue i have with this product is that they are a little too long.<br />i am 5&#34;2 and even with heels they are still to long. so i will have to have them himed up.<br />but they are very comfortable. these pants are really thick as well as comfortable.  perfect to wear on a cold winter\\'s day.  the finish is so nice they can be worn when you go out shopping and not look like you\\'re wearing sweats. i love the style and how they fit and the length was a little long but like it.  i went off another review that said to order one size smaller than your regular size. i was a bit leary of that and order  the 16 my reg. size  they fit very snug and than a 14  no way i can get in to them but i plan on getting in in the next few month i didn\\'t not like the coat .i would recommend this  but order you regular size not a smaller. pants are great however the top a little short comfortable, very good fit, looks great. i like the slacks a lot .  they will be very nice for all my summer events and a convention that i am going to.  i have always liked the bend over brand. i usually wear landau 8501 but recently that style was changed into more of a straight leg.  i only like cargo style pants so was happy to find this style.  i wear a small and the small i ordered fit well.  the major difference between the 8512 and the 8501 is that this style is much more comfortable.  they are not straight leg and have more of a loose comfy fit.  they are not baggy but give a really comfy, ease-of-movement feel.  also, the pants i received (i ordered 2 pairs) had a rich color to them and felt well made.  the drawstring was not finished at the end so i just made a small knot, and the back elastic seemed to move a little after washing, but these things in no way detract from the quality and both are a non-issue for me.<br /><br />if you are looking for a comfortable pant with (deep) cargo pockets, i don\\'t believe you will be disappointed with this pant. ummm the material is not exactly what i expected, but then again i didn\\'t pay attention to that so thats my fault. but i really like the lenth. i\\'m 5\\'2 so a lot of pants gather at the ankles because i\\'m vertically challenged. but these barely did that. good fit according to size chart every time i bend over the pants seem to slide down so i have to continually pull them back up. but they are really cute. besides the waist they fit well every where else. material not as thick as the ponte lysse leggings i was a little skeptical on how these would look and feel, but they are ridiculously comfortable. i\\'m 5\\'4 and they are a little long but still wearable with sneakers and they won\\'t drag on the floor. also, they\\'re not see-through at all. there is a small hole on the inseam at the bottom of one of the pant legs - it looks like the sewing got a little messed up - but the hole is small and i didn\\'t even notice it until the second or third time i wore the pants. i liked them enough to have ordered a second pair and that pair seems free of holes. these fit somewhat small, but honestly, i\\'m in the process of dropping about 5 more pounds, so once i slim down a tad more, they will probably fit exactly as they are supposed to, i plan on ordering more. i\\'m 5\\' 3&#34; and the length is nice. they barely touch the ground with tennis shoes on, so i can still jog in them, and do all my indoor exercises barefoot without them getting in the way. i ordered the black/hot pink and they are not sheer, which is something i was concerned about. the waist was nice because even though i\\'m getting rid of the last bit of my \\'muffin top\\', they smoothed over it nicely so i didn\\'t feel self conscious working out in them with my spare tire hanging out, lol. also, my husband loves it when i put them on, he thinks they make my bum look nice. the only thing that was a little annoying is once i washed them, they did attract a lot of fuzz/lint/pet hair, but nothing a once over with a lint roller couldn\\'t handle. i also hang mine to dry, i worry the dryer will cause piling and break down of the spandex in the fabric. overall, nice product at a  good price. i would recommend giving them a try if you have never bought yoga pants before and you want to see if you like them. it was the right fit, she love it. these pants fit me perfectly and are very flattering.  the fabric has a lovely drape and the hand is soft and very comfortable to wear.  the black is a true black and hasn\\'t shown any fading at this point.  they are a great pair of pants that can be worn both very casually or dressed up to go out in.  i plan on buying other pairs in different colors. wish this was offered in other material (not just knit). the legs fit great. love the color. fit well the size was right and looked exactly how the photo presented and overall i am happy with this purchase. these pants are awesome. the pants arrived earlier than expected. the pants look even better in person and i will order from this company again. i like the pants. the quality and the feel is fantastic. i just wish they came a little longer for a six foot tall person like myself. i\\'m petite 5 feet, 117 pounds, i ordered medium i thought that i need them a little loose and they fit like is a size small bought these for my boyfriend along with the cowboy/chaps lounge pants.  they really do look like old jeans.  great fit and very comfortable.  bought multiple pairs for other friends too. great fit very comfy look fabulous with a tunic. nicer than expected. i wear a tunic with mine. great at work. not as thin as i expected them based on other reviews. it\\'s a tee shirt like material, stretchy also. just a little long. über comfy! i wear them every chance i get. took less than one week to get them (california).'"
