# NLP_PinkText_Analysis
Role: Team Lead, ideator and programmer for "Pink Text." 

Purpose: use sentimental analysis on pants marketed towards different genders. 

Organization: submitted to Samsung AI as Capstone Project.

Project Phases:

1. I proposed this project based on recent articles and viral media surrounding the lack of pockets in women's pants. I named the project "Pink Text," referencing the Pink Tax on women's products. 
2. I used a novel approach to extract the dataset necessary for this project, and wrote the final code for the final project submission. 
3. I used Naive Bayes Classifier and applied it to genderless pants to find features associated with positive and negative ratings in Amazon reviews for Women’s and Men’s pants.
